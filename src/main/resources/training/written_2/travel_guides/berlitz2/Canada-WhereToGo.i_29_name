WHERE TO GO
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX> ith a country this big, how do you get to know the place as a whole? The answer is, of course, that you can‚Äôt. Not even most <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadians</ENAMEX> will have seen all that you will see on a well-planned trip. A visit to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> aiming at anything more than just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">destination¬†‚Äî¬†Toronto</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montr√©al</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Vancouver¬†‚Äî¬†is</ENAMEX> bound to seem a little intimidating. The distances to cover are enormous. But it can be done, with the journey itself a large part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adventure</ENAMEX>, as you zoom across the wide-open spaces separating <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> from another. The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Handy Travel Tips</ENAMEX> section, beginning on page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">218</NUMEX>, gives detailed practical guidance, but here are some general ideas to help you plan your trip.
On a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> visit, you‚Äôll probably be able to get a feel for just a few of the regions we describe, but you can capture the essence of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> in a judicious combination of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two or three</NUMEX> major <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> and the marvelous outdoor life. We do not attempt an encyclopedic coverage of every nook and cranny from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> border to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Arctic Circle</ENAMEX>, but we do provide a representative sample of the country‚Äôs attractions.
Where
We‚Äôve divided the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> regions, each with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> major <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> accessible by air as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúlaunching pad‚Äù</ENAMEX> from which to explore the hinterland: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ontario; Qu√©bec</ENAMEX>; the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newfoundland</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maritimes</ENAMEX>); <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">British Columbia</ENAMEX>; the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rockies</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Prairie Provinces</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alberta</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saskatchewan</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manitoba</ENAMEX>); and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">North</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yukon</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nunavut</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Northwest Territories</ENAMEX>).
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> suggested plans of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">attack</ENAMEX> are either to start in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toronto</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Montr√©al</ENAMEX> and take in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ontario</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qu√©bec</ENAMEX>, with side trips to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">coast</ENAMEX> or even out to the West; or to start in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vancouver</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Calgary</ENAMEX> and explore the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rockies</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">British Columbia</ENAMEX> before heading east to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ontario</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qu√©bec</ENAMEX>, taking in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Prairies</ENAMEX> on a cross-country train ride. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">North</ENAMEX>, on a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> trip, must be considered a proposition strictly for the adventurous. In any case, count on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least three weeks</TIMEX>, ideally <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a month</TIMEX>, to even begin to do the place justice.
When
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the great advantages to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canada‚Äôs</ENAMEX> vast size is that, apart from a couple of major tourist attractions such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Niagara Falls</ENAMEX>, it‚Äôs never overcrowded. Even in high <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">summer there‚</TIMEX>Äôs still plenty of room for everybody. Nonetheless, it is advisable to make advance bookings for some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort hotels</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific</ENAMEX> coast, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rockies</ENAMEX>, or around the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Great Lakes</ENAMEX>.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August</TIMEX> guarantee the best weather, though it can get very hot in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Montr√©al</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toronto</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Prairie Provinces</ENAMEX> (aggravated in those <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">provinces</ENAMEX> by the hot chinook wind off the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rockies</ENAMEX>). Farther to the north, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes</ENAMEX> can be a problem in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX>. Connoisseurs of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">forests</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qu√©bec</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Maritimes</ENAMEX> favor the spectacular <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">autumn</TIMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-October</TIMEX>. While the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Coast</ENAMEX> is mild in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June</TIMEX>, in central and eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> you‚Äôll still find snow on the ground in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX> and a nip in the air into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the month of June</TIMEX>. The period from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX> is strictly for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> sports <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enthusiasts</ENAMEX>.
Remember the old adage: There‚Äôs no bad weather, only bad clothing. In addition to your <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">light summer</TIMEX> wear, be sure to bring a sweater for the occasional chilly evenings. Rather than weighing down your luggage with anything cumbersome, take a leaf out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canadians‚</ENAMEX>Äô book and keep warm by wearing several layers. If you‚Äôre thinking of going north, consider long underwear. In any case, don‚Äôt forget a raincoat, especially for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">British Columbia</ENAMEX>. Important everywhere is a good pair of walking <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">shoes¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†something light but more solid than tennis shoes.
How
The most adventurous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traveler</ENAMEX> who loves to improvise will still need a certain amount of advance planning. Canada‚Äôs provincial tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> are conscientious and well worth consulting, even before you leave home. The national tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> is also helpful, but in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">provinces</ENAMEX> jealously protect their prerogatives against the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>, and maintain their own tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> that can give you detailed information about resorts, accommodations, camping, and sports facilities.
To cover <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> a continent, air travel is invaluable. To get the cheapest deal, plan the broad outlines of your itinerary ahead of time so that you can buy your tickets before you reach <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> national <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">airlines</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Canada</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> (each linked to smaller companies flying the interior), have cut-rate, multiple-flight ticketing. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Helicopters</ENAMEX> and hydroplanes can fly you for fishing and camping expeditions in the more remote areas. Do take advantage of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> cruises wherever you can¬<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">†‚Äî¬†around Newfoundland</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Halifax</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">harbor</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Great Lakes</ENAMEX>, or the Inside Passage off the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific</ENAMEX> coast.
For a closer look at all the wide-open spaces, take a train. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VIA Rail Canada</ENAMEX> is the national passenger<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">-train system</ENAMEX> using the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tracks</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canadian Pacific</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canadian National</ENAMEX>, who devote themselves strictly to more lucrative freight carrying. Serving pretty good <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> in comfortable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diners</ENAMEX>, with club <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX>, observation decks, and sleeping <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX>, VIA takes a leisurely <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four days</TIMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montr√</ENAMEX>©al to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vancouver</ENAMEX>. (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">From Montr√</ENAMEX>©al to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toronto</ENAMEX> it‚Äôs <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">51‚ÅÑ2 hours</TIMEX>, faster by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX> than by <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>.) You may also want to consider <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rocky Mountaineer Railtours</ENAMEX> (tel. (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">800</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">665-7245,</ENAMEX> <www.rockymountaineer.com>), which offers daylight trips through the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rockies</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">Buses</ENAMEX> are a possibility for the occasional excursion, but a car remains essential for independent mobility. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">airlines</ENAMEX> will arrange for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> rentals at each <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trans-Canada Highway</ENAMEX> stretches <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">nearly 8,000 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4,800 miles</NUMEX>) from coast to coast, and secondary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX> are very good until you get into the backwoods. Inside the major <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>, you may prefer to park your <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> and use the generally efficient public transport. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the best ways to explore the hinterland, especially in the national and provincial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX>, is to rent a comfortably equipped <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mobile home</ENAMEX> or camper. This, too, should be done in advance.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ONTARIO</ENAMEX>
This choice piece of real estate between the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Great Lakes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hudson Bay</ENAMEX> is the country‚Äôs dominant <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">province¬†‚Äî¬†too</ENAMEX> dominant for the liking of many of the others. With <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> clustered almost entirely along the southern border, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ontario</ENAMEX> is the most populous <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX> and the wealthiest, generating close to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40 percent</NUMEX> of the gross national product from manufacturing, construction, minerals, forestry, and agriculture. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX> has grown in vitality with the influx of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pakistani</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX>, reducing the once overwhelming ‚ÄúBritish‚Äù <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">majority</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">barely 50 percent</NUMEX>. If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ontarians</ENAMEX> are known for their bumptious spirit, they certainly have something to be bumptious about in their province‚Äôs burgeoning <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> and the riches of its farmlands, forests, and lakes.
Not content with taking over from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montr√</ENAMEX>©al as the nation‚Äôs business <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toronto</ENAMEX> is surging forward with a vigorous cultural and social life. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Bemused visitors</ENAMEX> from across the border note how it has been possible to create a vibrant modern metropolis without the hassles of inner-city <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">blight</ENAMEX> and violence. As the national capital, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottawa</ENAMEX> is the inevitable butt of jokes against its federal government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bureaucracy</ENAMEX>, but patriots revere its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parliament</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX> preserving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canada‚</ENAMEX>Äôs cultural treasures.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Niagara Falls</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ontario</ENAMEX>, has, to the chagrin of many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> tour <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operators</ENAMEX>, the best grandstand view of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Western World‚</ENAMEX>Äôs great natural wonders. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern Ontario‚</ENAMEX>Äôs countryside is a gentle green delight enhanced by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> theater festivals, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shaw</ENAMEX> festival at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Niagara</ENAMEX>-on-the-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lake</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare</ENAMEX> festival at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stratford</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cruise</ENAMEX> around the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Great Lakes</ENAMEX>, try the watersports on <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Georgian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bay</ENAMEX>, and explore the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Thousand Islands</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Point Pelee</ENAMEX> nature reserve.
Ontario‚Äôs history is preserved in lovingly reconstructed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> and forts marking the passage of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French Jesuit</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">missionaries</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sainte-Marie</ENAMEX> Among the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hurons</ENAMEX>, a fur-trading post at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Thunder Bay</ENAMEX>, military positions at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fort George</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Niagara</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Fort Henry</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kingston</ENAMEX>), and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pioneer communities</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Upper Canada Village</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morrisburg</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Black Creek</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toronto</ENAMEX>).
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toronto</ENAMEX>
Ethnically diverse, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toronto</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canada‚</ENAMEX>Äôs largest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, home to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.3 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. Hard to believe that this gleaming citadel of big business and the good urban life was a malarial swamp in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1790s</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Muddy York</ENAMEX> once could be recommended only by its commanding position on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lake Ontario</ENAMEX>, from which <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fort York</ENAMEX> guarded the troublesome <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> border. Today, the mud is neatly paved over, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes</ENAMEX> have flown elsewhere, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> are less trouble than they used to be. Yonge Street, the military <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">highway</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Simcoe</ENAMEX> thrust north from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">fort</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lake Simcoe</ENAMEX>, starts out now as downtown <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toronto‚</ENAMEX>Äôs main commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">artery</ENAMEX>. Its intersection at the elegant shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">thoroughfare</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Bloor Street</ENAMEX>, is the fashionable <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">hub</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>.
Following <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Simcoe‚</ENAMEX>Äôs military grid pattern, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toronto‚</ENAMEX>Äôs main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">arteries</ENAMEX> run from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lakefront</ENAMEX> north: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spadina</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University Avenues</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bay</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yonge</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Church Streets</ENAMEX>; and east‚Äìwest: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Front</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">King</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Queen</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dundas</ENAMEX>, College-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carlton</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Bloor Streets</ENAMEX>. Our sightseeing itinerary starts down at the waterfront and works north through the business district to the chic shopping and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> area. As an alternative, especially if you have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, you may prefer to start downtown, around <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Union Station</ENAMEX>, and visit the other sights to the north before coming back to relax among the recreational attractions of the waterfront. Getting around the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> is quite simple, but while downtown, park your <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> and walk or use the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">buses</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">subway</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Waterfront Area</ENAMEX>
You might face severe punishment from those very proud <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Torontonians</ENAMEX> if you don‚Äôt begin your waterfront tour with a trip up the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CN Tower</ENAMEX>. This handsome, outsize TV antenna makes up for its unimaginative name (from its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">builder</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canadian National</ENAMEX> railway and telecommunications company) with all the fanciful interpretations of its shape: jousting lance, hypodermic needle, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">serpent</ENAMEX> frozen rigid while swallowing a football. At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">605 m</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,815 ft</NUMEX>), it is currently the world‚Äôs highest freestanding structure, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">19 m</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">56</NUMEX> ft) more than a similar monster in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moscow</ENAMEX>.
A plexiglass elevator <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whizzes</ENAMEX> you up the outside of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> observation decks in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Skypod</ENAMEX>. The ride is free for those going to the revolving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">nightclub</ENAMEX> (which also rank as the world‚Äôs highest, if you don‚Äôt count a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rockies</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alps</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Himalayas</ENAMEX>). The view at the top reveals a whole history of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toronto</ENAMEX> in the contrast between the glass-and-steel <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">skyscraper canyons</ENAMEX> of the financial district, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">geometric dome</ENAMEX> and cantilevered structures of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ontario</ENAMEX> Place leisure complex, and the old-fashioned gabled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> of the neighborhoods.
Take a second elevator to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Space Deck</ENAMEX>, to get the full sweep of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lake Ontario‚</ENAMEX>Äôs so-called <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">‚ÄúGolden Horseshoe</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äù Including Toronto</ENAMEX>, this dense urban belt from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oshawa</ENAMEX> in the east to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hamilton</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Catharines</ENAMEX> in the west houses <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> the total <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX>. More romantically, you can catch a glimpse of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Niagara Falls</ENAMEX> and peer across the border to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Buffalo</ENAMEX>.
After years of neglect, when it served only the lake‚Äôs loading <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">docks</ENAMEX>, railway <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">depots</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factories</ENAMEX>, the waterfront has become a major attraction for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Torontonians</ENAMEX> at play.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harbourfront</ENAMEX> is a bright new neighborhood reclaimed from a swampy wasteland, at the foot of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CN Tower</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rundown</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">warehouses</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factories</ENAMEX> have been transformed into art <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">galleries</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boutiques</ENAMEX>, a sailing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">playgrounds</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>, and, more recently, chic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartments</ENAMEX>. Young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">upwardly</ENAMEX> mobile peddlers of old and new-old <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">china</ENAMEX> and other bric-a-brac on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Queen‚Äôs Quay West</ENAMEX> call their <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">flea</ENAMEX> market the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harbourfront Antique Market</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canadian Railway Museum</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Spadina Pier</ENAMEX> exhibits some of the earliest engines to cross the continent. For a thorough view of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port facilities</ENAMEX>, take the harbor boat tour organized by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toronto Harbor Commission</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Facing Harbourfront</ENAMEX>, the breezy beaches and picnic areas of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toronto Islands</ENAMEX> offer another handy escape from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> bustle. They were part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Scarborough Bluffs</ENAMEX> peninsula until storms and floods in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-19th century</TIMEX> broke them up into islands, joined <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridges</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ferryboats</ENAMEX> leave from the docks behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hilton Harbor Castle Hotel</ENAMEX> at the foot of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Yonge Street</ENAMEX>, calling at the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> main islands. No <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> are allowed, but you can rent a bicycle, downtown or on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Centre Island</ENAMEX>. The latter is the most popular with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Torontonians</ENAMEX>, and its beaches are particularly crowded on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekends</TIMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July</TIMEX>, it is the major focus of the great <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Indian Festival of Caribana</ENAMEX>, celebrating those other islands‚Äô extravagant costumes and music, featuring steel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX>, calypso, and reggae. <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Quieter Ward‚Äôs Island</ENAMEX>, at the eastern end, is more residential; you can join the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locals</ENAMEX> for their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> constitutional on the boardwalk. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Swimmers</ENAMEX> tend to favor the beach at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hanlan‚Äôs Point</ENAMEX>, to the west, behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Toronto Island Airport</ENAMEX>.
Jutting out from the grounds of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Canadian National Exhibition (‚ÄúEx‚</ENAMEX>Äù to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locals</ENAMEX>; held in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late August</TIMEX>), the ultramodern recreation <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ontario</ENAMEX> Place is built on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> man-made islands. It combines the atmospheres of a theme <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> and a cultural <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>.
Its most outstanding landmark is the white geodesic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dome</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cinesphere</ENAMEX>. On a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>-story-high circular screen, it shows superb documentary films of spectacular natural phenomena, such as volcanic eruptions or the latest advances in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">earth</ENAMEX> and space exploration. Pedalos are a delightfully lazy way of getting a duck‚Äôs eye view of the attractions. Energetic <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4- to 14-year-olds</TIMEX> love the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Children‚Äôs Village</ENAMEX>, complete with trampoline and waterslide, and toddlers can splash around in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">duck ponds</ENAMEX>. Before you move on, put your drenched <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> through the huge <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">‚Äúdryer‚Äù</ENAMEX> shaped like a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bird</ENAMEX>. The older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX> gathers at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Molson Canadian Ampitheatre</ENAMEX> to listen to rock concerts or heads for the outdoor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ForumAmpitheatre</ENAMEX>, seating <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spectators</ENAMEX> for its classical, jazz, and rock concerts. The best way to ensure good seats for the top attractions is to picnic on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">grass</ENAMEX> before the show begins.
Moored at the entrance to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">warship</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">H.M.C.S. Haida</ENAMEX>, a destroyer active in <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Korean War</ENAMEX> named after the peace-loving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Haida Indians</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">British Columbia</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">You‚Äôll</ENAMEX> find sea <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cadets</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> to answer your questions.
Nearby, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marine Museum of Upper Canada</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Exhibition Place</ENAMEX>, just west of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Princes‚Äô Gate</ENAMEX>) traces the history of shipping on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Lawrence River</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Great Lakes</ENAMEX>, with all the brass and wooden paraphernalia of the old <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX> in addition to some beautiful scale models.
If patriots make a reverent pilgrimage to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canada‚Äôs Sports Hall of Fame</ENAMEX> (just off <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lakeshore Boulevard West</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Exhibition Place</ENAMEX>) to salute heroic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">athletes</ENAMEX> of the past, the separate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hockey Hall of Fame</ENAMEX> provides a tonic lesson for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> to recall, among the trophies, masks, skates, and hockey sticks, the fact that nearly all their ice hockey <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heroes</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX>-born. With the many splits between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglo</ENAMEX>- and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadians</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Protestants</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catholics</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice hockey</ENAMEX> is the closest thing the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> has to a state religion.
Of all the many historic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> carefully preserved and prettied up around the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Old Fort York</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Garrison Road</ENAMEX> off <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Fleet Street</ENAMEX> between <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Bathurst Street</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Strachan Avenue</ENAMEX>) has one of the most bizarre locations, sandwiched between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gardner Expressway</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">railway tracks</ENAMEX>. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lieutenant Governor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simcoe</ENAMEX> built it in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1793</TIMEX>, it commanded a strategic position directly on the lakeshore, facing potential attack from across the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> border. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">War of 1812</ENAMEX>, retreating <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> chose to destroy it rather than let it fall into <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> hands. It was rebuilt in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1841</TIMEX> and restored in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1934</TIMEX> as a tourist attraction, with a diorama of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Battle of York</ENAMEX> and authentically furnished <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">officers‚Äô quarters</ENAMEX>, log cabins, and military surgery. In summertime, you can watch <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> parading in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Army‚</ENAMEX>Äôs famous <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">scarlet uniforms</ENAMEX>, performing bayonet drills and firing their muskets.
Heart of Downtown
The essence of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toronto</ENAMEX>, old and new, is concentrated around <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Union Station</ENAMEX>. It was inaugurated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prince</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wales</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1927</TIMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stations</ENAMEX> were still built like <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> temples (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Corinthian pillars</ENAMEX>, heroic statues, and ceramic<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">-tiled</NUMEX> ceilings); it is one last proud fanfare for the transcontinental <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">railways</ENAMEX> that founded the country‚Äôs industrial prosperity. In this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">headquarters city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canadian National railways</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">station</ENAMEX> also symbolized <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toronto‚Äôs</ENAMEX> position as a major commercial and industrial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">center</ENAMEX>. Across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>, the venerable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX>, refurbished to something of its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1929</TIMEX> grandeur, provides a businessmen‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> as appropriate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">counterpart</ENAMEX>. It is linked to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">station</ENAMEX> by a large underground concourse of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX>.
If the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX> and its hotel showed where <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toronto</ENAMEX> was heading, the bright new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Metro Toronto Convention Center</ENAMEX> to the west proclaims the city‚Äôs triumphant arrival. Its amenities include all the latest electronic technology for audiovisual and communications services, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">halls</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to 12,000</NUMEX> conventioneers, banquet <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">halls</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grand Ball Room</ENAMEX>, and sports facilities to stretch those tired <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> muscles.
Providing a cultural counterpoint a block north of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Convention Center</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vancouver</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arthur Erickson‚</ENAMEX>Äôs transparent <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roy Thomson Hall</ENAMEX> glows at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> to show off the throngs of smart concert-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">goers</ENAMEX> attending the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toronto Symphony Orchestra</ENAMEX>. The more middlebrow entertainment of bouncy <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Broadway</ENAMEX> musicals can be had at the nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Edwardian Royal Alexandra Theatre</ENAMEX>. This, along with the popular old-fashioned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> next door, was restored by discount retailing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tycoon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ed Mirvish</ENAMEX>, who later endeared himself to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> theater public by renovating <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">London‚Äôs Old Vic</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Bay Street</ENAMEX> financial district, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚ÄúInland‚Äù</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Union Station</ENAMEX>, accentuates the town‚Äôs evolution. Almost all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Neo-Classical</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">limestone</ENAMEX> and marble monuments enshrining the old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX> and stock exchange have been replaced by glittering steel-and-glass <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">towers</ENAMEX> and tiered <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pyramids</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Bank Plaza</ENAMEX>, at the corner of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Front and Bay Streets</ENAMEX>, reflects the new prosperity in the gilded glass of its windows (treated with some real <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX>). The vast <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lobby</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">atrium</ENAMEX> of the interior are correspondingly opulent, a dazzling play of cascade, ponds, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">greenery</ENAMEX> beneath a d√©cor of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aluminum</ENAMEX> cylinders, the work of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Venezuelan</ENAMEX> sculptor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jes√∫s Raphael Soto</ENAMEX>. While the plaza‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boris Zerafa</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gifted ‚</ENAMEX>Äúlocal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚Äù Toronto‚</ENAMEX>Äôs other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX> have not hesitated to bring in talents of international renown.
In starkly austere but elegant contrast to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Bank‚</ENAMEX>Äôs exuberance is <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> Bauhaus <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">master</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mies van der Rohe‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> black steel <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">towers</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toronto Dominion Centre</ENAMEX> (between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wellington</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">King Streets</ENAMEX>). Immediately to the east in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commerce Court</ENAMEX> is an exhilarating <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">57-story glass-and-stainless-steel</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese-American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">I. M. Pei</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designer</ENAMEX> of the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Washington‚Äôs National Gallery</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Great Pyramid</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Louvre</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX>.
Completing the financial picture north of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dominion Center</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Canadian Place, Canada‚</ENAMEX>Äôs tallest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">office building</ENAMEX>. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bank of Montr√©al</ENAMEX>, reached across a pleasant green <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX> with smart <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> around the waterfall. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> houses the infinitely more boisterous, modern <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toronto Stock Exchange</ENAMEX>. Behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Exchange Tower</ENAMEX> is a trading <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pavilion</ENAMEX> with an observation deck from which you can watch the frenetic transactions. Best hours are between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10am and 2pm</TIMEX>. Mammon keeps <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> with the muses in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Exchange Lobby</ENAMEX> where, against a handsome setting of sculptures, paintings, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Art Deco</ENAMEX> design, computer monitors give the latest prices from around the world.
A bustling underground network of concourses and escalators links the major <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> of the financial district to create a whole other neighborhood of shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">malls</ENAMEX>, cinemas, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, providing warm <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shelter</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the winter</TIMEX> and air-conditioned relief in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">humid summer</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">East</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Yonge Street</ENAMEX> along <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Front</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hummingbird Centre for the Performing Arts</ENAMEX> is a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">less-than-graceful</NUMEX> concrete bunker that is home to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Ballet of Canada</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canadian Opera Company</ENAMEX>. Next door, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> drama, both contemporary and classical, is given pride of place at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Lawrence Centre for the Performing Arts</ENAMEX>. A block away at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Jarvis Street</ENAMEX>, the sprawling indoor-outdoor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Lawrence Market</ENAMEX> is open <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesdays</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturdays</TIMEX>, with the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">flea</ENAMEX> market setting up its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stalls</ENAMEX> here on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sundays</TIMEX>. Buskers turn it into something of a genteel <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> country fair on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the weekend</TIMEX>. Nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Lawrence Hall</ENAMEX>, once host to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">freaks</ENAMEX> and darlings of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Victorian</ENAMEX> vaudeville, has been beautifully restored to its original pink and green to provide a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Ballet</ENAMEX>.
In a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> not renowned for its ecumenical harmony<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">, Church Street</ENAMEX> lines up the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglican St. James Cathedral</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Church‚Äôs Metropolitan Church</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roman Catholic St. Michael‚Äôs Cathedral</ENAMEX>, each an architectural variation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Neo-Gothic</ENAMEX> style of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Victorian era</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North of Queen Street</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nathan Phillips Square</ENAMEX>, named after a prominent <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toronto</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mayor</ENAMEX>, is the center of municipal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX>, ethnic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> hold their festivals and parades around the great reflecting pool. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the winter</TIMEX>, the pool becomes a skating <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rink</ENAMEX> and the focus for ebullient celebrations on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Year‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Eve</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Old City Hall</ENAMEX>, a grand <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Neo-Gothic</ENAMEX> stone monument (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1899</TIMEX>) with clock-<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> and gargoyles, has been converted into a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courthouse</ENAMEX> to make way for the striking modern (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1965</TIMEX>) landmark of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New City Hall</ENAMEX>, designed by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Finnish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Viljo Revell</ENAMEX>. Its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> gently curving office <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">blocks</ENAMEX> open like an oyster over a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">domed ‚Äúpearl‚Äù</ENAMEX> containing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">council chamber</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Henry Moore‚Äôs statue The Archer</ENAMEX> adorns the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX>.
No tour of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toronto‚</ENAMEX>Äôs civic past and present is complete without a pilgrimage over to Bond Street, south of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dundas</ENAMEX>, to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mackenzie</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX>, home of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toronto‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> and most celebrated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mayor</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">82</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bond St.</ENAMEX>, tel. (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">416</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">392-6915</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Lyon Mackenzie</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dundee</ENAMEX>-born <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Scot</ENAMEX>, lived here after his return from exile for leading a revolt in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1837</TIMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>). In the meticulously restored interior, guides in traditional colonial dress explain the memorabilia of the fiery newspaperman, including the hand-operated flatbed printing press on which he turned out his revolutionary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX>, The <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Colonial Advocate</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">West of Mackenzie House</ENAMEX>, at the corner of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yonge</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dundas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>, is one of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Toronto‚Äôs shopping ‚Äúmusts</ENAMEX>,‚Äù the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eaton Centre</ENAMEX>. The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late-20th-century</TIMEX> phenomenon of the giant <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mall</ENAMEX> becomes here a spectacular showcase of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">galleries</ENAMEX> under an arched glass roof, with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiberglass geese</ENAMEX> suspended in a refreshing d√©cor of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">greenery</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">West of Nathan Phillips Square</ENAMEX>, beyond tree-lined <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">lawns</ENAMEX>, is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Osgoode Hall</ENAMEX>, a true jewel of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Georgian</ENAMEX> architecture in white limestone and amber brick, and the seat, since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1832</TIMEX>, of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Law Society of Upper Canada</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Notice the</ENAMEX> beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wrought-iron ‚Äúcow gates‚</ENAMEX>Äù put up at the main entrance to keep the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cattle</ENAMEX> out in those early rural <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>. It may whet your appetite to see a couple of other gracious relics of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Georgian</ENAMEX> era inside. Visit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campbell House</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1822</TIMEX>) on the northwest corner of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Queen</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">University Streets</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guides</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Colonial Dames‚</ENAMEX>Äô costumes will show you around the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">home</ENAMEX> of Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Campbell</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chief Justice</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Upper Canada</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1820s</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Grange</ENAMEX> can be reached through the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">basement</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Art Gallery</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ontario</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">59</NUMEX>) at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Grange Park</ENAMEX>. There, costumed guides will help to give you a sense of the grand life enjoyed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the much admired and hated <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Family Compact</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boultons</ENAMEX> built this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">country mansion</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1817</TIMEX>, when its grounds stretched <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">more than 3 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 miles</NUMEX>) from Queen clear up to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Bloor Street</ENAMEX>. Note the fine winding staircase, statuary, and stained-glass windows. Be sure to go downstairs, too, to visit the spacious <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchens</ENAMEX>. On <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">McCaul Street</ENAMEX>, across from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Art Gallery</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Village</ENAMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Grange</ENAMEX> tries to recreate something of this old world atmosphere for its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boutiques</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Queen‚Äôs Park</ENAMEX> and Yorkville
The broad tree-lined <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University Avenue</ENAMEX> makes an appropriately dignified and pleasant approach to the High Victorian pink sandstone <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Provincial Parliament Building</ENAMEX> and other government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the middle of the oval</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Queen‚Äôs Park</ENAMEX>. Guided tours will show you the principal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">halls</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chambers</ENAMEX>. From the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">visitors‚Äô gallery</ENAMEX>, you can watch provincial parliamentary debates when in session (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February to June and October</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December</TIMEX>).
West of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Queen‚Äôs Park</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Toronto</ENAMEX>, one of the top <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">colleges</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North America</ENAMEX>, with most of its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> in traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Oxbridge Romanesque</ENAMEX>-and-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gothic</ENAMEX>. The medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> has maintained a high reputation since its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frederick Banting</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Best</ENAMEX> made their discovery of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1921</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">university</ENAMEX> bookshop¬†‚Äî¬†known locally as book rooms¬†‚Äî¬†on College Street is the best in town.
Between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avenue Road</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Yonge Street</ENAMEX> north of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bloor</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yorkville</ENAMEX>, the town‚Äôs most appealing district in which to stroll. In a transformation no less dramatic than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harbourfront</ENAMEX>, the hippy slum of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s</TIMEX> has been refurbished into a chic neighborhood of fashionable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boutiques</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">art galleries</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sidewalk caf√©s</ENAMEX>, gourmet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, and colorfully repainted old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hazelton Lanes</ENAMEX> is a delightful variation on the conventional shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mall</ENAMEX>, where the maze of walkways and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">staircases</ENAMEX> around sunken <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">courtyards</ENAMEX> is deliberately designed to get you lost until you buy or eat your way out.
You might very easily walk right past the unprepossessing fa√ßade of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metro Toronto Library</ENAMEX> (on Yonge <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">block</ENAMEX> north of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bloor</ENAMEX>), but the subtly interconnected areas of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Raymond Moriyama‚</ENAMEX>Äôs striking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">interior</ENAMEX> may tempt you to give up your vacation and get down to some solid study. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floors</ENAMEX> of book stacks in a d√©cor of orange and burnt sienna surround a brilliant <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">atrium enclosing greenery</ENAMEX>, a fountain, and a reflector pool, while a transparent elevator zips silently up and down.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crazy Casa Loma</ENAMEX>, northwest of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yorkville</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Austin Terrace</ENAMEX>, is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toronto‚</ENAMEX>Äôs answer to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">California‚Äôs Hearst Castle</ENAMEX>. Its battlements and turrets are all a self-respecting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">financier</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Pellatt</ENAMEX> could have wished for. After touring the castles of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> for a few ideas, he built the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">98</NUMEX>-room <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansion</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1900s</TIMEX> at the then-astronomical cost of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$3,500,000</NUMEX>. He chose his <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">oak</ENAMEX> and walnut from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North America</ENAMEX>, teak from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX>, paneling, marble, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glass</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. With all its terraces, massive walls, and echoing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX>, it isn‚Äôt exactly cozy. That may explain why <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pellatt</ENAMEX> provided himself with a secret escape route through a hidden staircase leading from his study (and now open to the public). Whatever folly of grandeur the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">financier</ENAMEX> entertained is best seen in the opulently paneled <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Oak Room</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stained-glass dome</ENAMEX>, marble <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floors</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italianate</ENAMEX> bronze doors of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Conservatory</ENAMEX>. Take the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">long</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tunnel</ENAMEX> from the wine <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cellar</ENAMEX> to the stables, where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX> were spoiled silly with a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> tile and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mahogany</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Ethnic Neighborhoods</ENAMEX>
In typical <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">North American</ENAMEX> style, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toronto‚</ENAMEX>Äôs ethnic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> move around as they grow more affluent or as new construction pushes them out. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">high-rises</ENAMEX> and parking <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garages</ENAMEX> behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New City Hall</ENAMEX> forced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chinatown</ENAMEX> to move west. This is the largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chinatown</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>, if not in all of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North America</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX> has set up <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, hardware <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX>, and herbal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> along <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Dundas Street</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Spadina Avenue</ENAMEX>. Look in at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pagoda-roofed</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China Court</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> grouped around a little <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garden</ENAMEX>.
Other ethnic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">groups¬†‚Äî¬†Portuguese</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greeks</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italians</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">East Indians¬</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">†‚Äî¬†buy</ENAMEX> and sell at nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kensington</ENAMEX> Market, west of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spadina</ENAMEX>. It has the delightful, exotic chaos of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a bustling</NUMEX> bazaar, most of all on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">mornings</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> who once inhabited this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kensington</ENAMEX> Market area have moved to smarter <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Forest Hill</ENAMEX>, northwest of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Casa Loma</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">You‚Äôll</ENAMEX> find souvlaki <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> and bouzouki music of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Little Athens</ENAMEX> across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Don River</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Danforth Avenue</ENAMEX>, home of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX>. Little <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX>, which is actually shared with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX>, is located around <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dufferin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Clair West</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Museums</ENAMEX>
Undergoing an ambitious program of renovation, the richly endowed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Ontario Museum</ENAMEX>, popularly known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ROM</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Queen‚Äôs Park</ENAMEX>), has won international recognition for its collections of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Egyptian</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> antiquities, as well as the art of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">North American Indians</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Inuit</ENAMEX>.
The magnificent <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> Collection presents the objects and ornaments of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 3,500</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> of civilization, stretching from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bronze Age Shang Dynasty</ENAMEX> to the extinction of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manchu Dynasty</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1912</TIMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> became a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">republic</ENAMEX>. The exhibits include ceramic statues of various <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">figures</ENAMEX> of the imperial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX>, as well as models of a noble‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ming</ENAMEX> tomb. In a refreshing departure from the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">conventionally dry</ENAMEX> and scholarly displays of antiquities, the captions on the showcases do a fine job of placing the exhibits in a living <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">context¬†‚Äî¬†explaining</ENAMEX>, for instance, the way a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> was designed to deal with the changing elements and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seasons</TIMEX>, or the religious significance of the figurines that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tomb</ENAMEX>.
The bulk of the collection was assembled by fur <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Crofts</ENAMEX> after he settled in the port of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tianjin</ENAMEX>; it was continued after his death in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1925</TIMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglican Bishop</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hunan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Charles White</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bishop White Gallery</ENAMEX> features <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Taoist</ENAMEX> frescoes of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 13th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yuan Dynasty</ENAMEX>, under <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Emperor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kublai Khan</ENAMEX>, along with some monumental polychrome and gilded wooden statues of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buddha</ENAMEX>. 
Across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ROM</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George R. Gardiner Museum</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Ceramic Art</ENAMEX> offers a very attractive way of acquiring an instant history of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ceramics</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> b.c. to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 18th century</TIMEX>. The huge collection includes pre-Columbian earthenware figures, brilliant <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance Majolica</ENAMEX>, more sedate but elegant <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> Delftware of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16th and 17th centuries</TIMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rococo</ENAMEX> forms of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Meissen</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">porcelain</ENAMEX>. In front of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Art Gallery</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ontario</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AGO</ENAMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">317</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dundas Street West</ENAMEX>, an intense <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Moore</ENAMEX> bronze, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Large Two Forms</ENAMEX>, proclaims the museum‚Äôs outstanding feature: <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North America‚</ENAMEX>Äôs finest collection of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Briton‚Äôs</ENAMEX> works. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Henry Moore Sculpture Centre</ENAMEX> occupies a whole wing designed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX> himself. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">600</NUMEX> pieces of the collection shown on a rotation basis include major works, small-scale bronze models, sketches, and paintings. But it‚Äôs the great plaster casts in their sometimes brutal original <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> that give the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitor</ENAMEX> a unique opportunity to see a representative sample of the monumental pieces that grace public squares and university quadrangles all over the world. Besides the celebrated reclining figures, look for the formidable skull-like design from which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nuclear Energy</ENAMEX> monument was <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cast</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Chicago</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AGO‚Äôs Walker Gallery</ENAMEX> exhibits sculpture by fellow <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Briton Barbara Hepworth</ENAMEX>, as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rodin, D√©gas</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maillol</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> collection of paintings includes important works by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tintoretto, Rembrandt, Van Dyck</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rubens</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frans Hals</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jan van Goyen</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Poussin</ENAMEX>. An <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ontario</ENAMEX> collection gives a prominent place to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painters</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hogarth, Raeburn, Reynolds</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gainsborough</ENAMEX>. Among the Impressionists and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">followers</ENAMEX> represented here are <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Renoir</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pissarro</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monet</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C√©zanne</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Van Gogh</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚ÄúModerns‚Äù</ENAMEX> include <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matisse</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Picasso</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Braque</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> collection provides a comprehensive survey of 200 years of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> painting, pride of place going to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Emily Carr</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Thomson</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the influential <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group of Seven</ENAMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> outskirts are well worth the trip. The marvelously entertaining <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ontario Science Centre</ENAMEX> stands <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">11 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6 miles</NUMEX>) northeast of the city <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">770</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Don Mills Rd</ENAMEX>.). Here, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> are expected to participate, and they do so enthusiastically in what turns into a sophisticated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">push-button</ENAMEX> play <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>, focused as much on the future as the past and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">present¬†‚Äî¬†</ENAMEX> proving that science can be fun.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Centre‚Äôs</ENAMEX> design, in a lovely green ravine of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Don River valley</ENAMEX>, makes an exciting first impression. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Architect</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Raymond Moriyama</ENAMEX> has linked up the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Centre‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> with escalators and passageways like a series of atomic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">nuclei</ENAMEX>, comparable to his work on the various spaces and levels of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metro Toronto Library</ENAMEX>.
Inside, it‚Äôs one thing to remember what your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> told you about static electricity, and quite another to touch (without risk) the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Centre‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500,000</NUMEX>-volt sphere and see your hair stand on end. You can man the controls of a space <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicle</ENAMEX> for a simulated moon-landing, broadcast your voice clear around the world through a parabolic sound reflector, or find out what goes on off-camera in a fully equipped TV <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">studio</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">McMichael Canadian Collection</ENAMEX> (in the village of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kleinburg</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">25 km/15 miles</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">40 minutes‚Äô</NUMEX> drive, northwest of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toronto</ENAMEX>) consecrates the work of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canada‚</ENAMEX>Äôs best-known <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> of painting, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group of Seven</ENAMEX>. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first half of the 20th century</TIMEX> sought the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of their inspiration in a distinctly <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> landscape rather than in the derivative themes of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> painting. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> has chosen an appropriate setting of evergreen forest overlooking the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Humber valley</ENAMEX> for its location. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stone</ENAMEX> and log <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> is itself, in more solid form, a visual reference to the log cabins of the country‚Äôs earliest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">settlers</ENAMEX>. Look out, too, for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Inuit</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> art, most notably the work of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Norval Morrisseau</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mid√©wiwin Indian</ENAMEX> from northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ontario</ENAMEX> whose works explore traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> with a modern abstract technique.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Black Creek Pioneer Village</ENAMEX>
Here, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">12 miles</NUMEX>) northwest of downtown <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toronto</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Jane Street</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Steeles Avenue</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conservationists</ENAMEX> have re-created <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">an 1860s</TIMEX> farm and an early <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ontario</ENAMEX> log-cabin <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX>. In horse-drawn <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">carts</ENAMEX> you visit costumed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">villagers</ENAMEX> tilling and harvesting, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sheep</ENAMEX>-shearing, grinding flour in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mill</ENAMEX>, weaving, and fashioning horseshoes in the smithy. Home-cooked meals are served at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">posthouse inn</ENAMEX>. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Niagara Peninsula</ENAMEX>
The <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">90-minute</TIMEX> drive from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toronto</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Niagara Falls</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">130 km/81 miles</NUMEX> south of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toronto</ENAMEX>) curves around the west end of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lake Ontario</ENAMEX> through the province‚Äôs industrial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">heartland¬†‚Äî¬†Mississauga</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hamilton</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. Catharines</ENAMEX>, known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golden Horseshoe</ENAMEX>. If you want to see the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Falls</ENAMEX> without getting entangled overnight in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mob</ENAMEX> scene of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annually</TIMEX>), stay over in the quieter <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Niagara</ENAMEX>-on-the-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lake</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a mere half-hour</TIMEX> drive away.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Niagara Falls</ENAMEX>
The true marvel of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Niagara</ENAMEX> is how nature manages to triumph over tawdry commercialism, perhaps less strident on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> than on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> side of the border marked by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Falls</ENAMEX>. No amount of pushy peddlers or tacky pink honeymoon <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">motels</ENAMEX> (if you do stay overnight, ask to see one of the hilarious bridal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">suites</ENAMEX>) can diminish the spectacle of that mass of white <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> taking its awesome plunge on the way from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lake Erie</ENAMEX> towards <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lake Ontario</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Mere statistics¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†an average of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2,830 cubic m</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100,000 cubic ft</NUMEX>) of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> per second generating <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4 million kilowatts</NUMEX> of energy¬†‚Äî¬†convey nothing of the falls‚Äô immensity, but a close-up view is unforgettable. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Niagara River</ENAMEX> divides in fact into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> major cascades around <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Goat Island</ENAMEX>: to the east, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">American Falls</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">61 m/184 ft</NUMEX> high with a crestline of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">350 m/1,076 ft</NUMEX>) and to the west, the more dramatic <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> Horseshoe <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Falls</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">58 m/177 ft</NUMEX> high with a curving crestline of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">670 m/2,214 ft</NUMEX>), and a smaller cascade off to the side, known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bridal Veil</ENAMEX>.
There are several vantage points from which to view the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Falls</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table Rock</ENAMEX>, named after a ledge that‚Äôs long since fallen in the river, is right on the brink of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Horseshoe Falls</ENAMEX>. Down below, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table Rock Scenic Tunnels</ENAMEX> take you behind the mighty wall of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>. With the price of the ticket, you borrow some protective clothing, but nothing is totally waterproof against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Niagara</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Don‚Äôt</ENAMEX> let that worry you¬†‚Äî¬†seeing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Niagara</ENAMEX> and not getting wet would be silly. Just keep a dry change of clothing in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> tour below the falls in one of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX> that go by the name of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Maid of the Mist</ENAMEX> takes you past and damply close to both falls. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish Aero</ENAMEX> cable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">car</ENAMEX> gives you a bird‚Äôs-eye view of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Niagara Whirlpool rapids</ENAMEX>. For an overall view, try the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Skylon</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Minolta</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">towers</ENAMEX>.
Away from the hustle and hype, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Queen Victoria Park</ENAMEX> is a delight for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hikers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cyclists</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">picnickers¬†‚Äî¬†even</ENAMEX> cross-country <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">skiers</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX>, when the falls take on a much more romantic look, all the more so for being relatively deserted. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">spring</TIMEX>, the park gardens put on a magnificent show of daffodils, tulips, magnolias, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">roses</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diners</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> restaurant get a great view of the falls‚Äô nighttime illuminations.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Niagara</ENAMEX>-on-the-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lake</ENAMEX>
A meandering <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">30-km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">18-mile</NUMEX>) riverside drive north along the lovely tree-lined <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Niagara Parkway</ENAMEX> takes you from the tumult of the tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">buses</ENAMEX> to the tranquillity of this old <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Loyalist bastion</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, settled by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">refugees</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Revolution</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1792</TIMEX> and briefly capital of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Upper Canada</ENAMEX>, jealously preserves an image of a ‚ÄúBritish‚Äù way of life revisited by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">North American</ENAMEX> nostalgia. The main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>, Queen Street, pays tribute to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglo-Saxon</ENAMEX> myth with its clock <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX>, white clapboard and red-brick <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>, the grand <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prince</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wales Hotel</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> serving buns and buttered scones, and the lovingly restored <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Niagara Apothecary</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1866</TIMEX>) displaying old-fashioned medicine jars in walnut cabinets under ornamental crystal gaslights.
On the quiet avenues off the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>, you can taste something of the genteel life in some delightful little boarding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> that supplement the usual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX>. They operate principally from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX>, when the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> hosts the popular <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Shaw Festival</ENAMEX>. Works of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Bernard Shaw</ENAMEX> and other major playwrights are performed in the modern <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Festival Theatre</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Wellington Street and Queen‚Äôs Parade Road</ENAMEX>), with its pleasant <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garden</ENAMEX> for a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocktail</ENAMEX> between acts. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> of smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">theaters</ENAMEX> put on musical comedies and light revues.
On the outskirts of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fort George</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garrison</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Niagara</ENAMEX> frontier during the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">1812 War</ENAMEX>, destroyed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>, was restored in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1940s</TIMEX>. A rebuilt stockade of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">earth</ENAMEX> and log bastions connected by a wooden palisade surrounds workshops, hospital, kitchens, and the original <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1796</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stone powder</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>. Infantry drills are staged in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX>.
Apart from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">B.C.‚Äôs Okanagan Valley</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Niagara</ENAMEX> peninsula is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canada‚</ENAMEX>Äôs only serious wine-growing area, not comparable with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bordeaux</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Burgundy</ENAMEX>, but still respectable. At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. David‚Äôs</ENAMEX>, southwest of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, you can visit the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ch√°teau des Charmes</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">winery</ENAMEX> and taste for yourself.
Stratford
Situated in the heart of the peninsula, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">130 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">78 miles</NUMEX>) or <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 hours‚Äô</NUMEX> drive from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toronto</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Stratford</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> is well worth a visit for its celebrated <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Stratford Festival</ENAMEX> spanning the whole tourist season, from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May to November</TIMEX>. Since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tyrone Guthrie</ENAMEX> opened the festival in a tent in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1953</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> classics such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sheridan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marlowe</ENAMEX> have been given pride of place. Their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> is now the apron-staged <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Festival Theatre</ENAMEX>, while the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avon Theatre</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Third Stage</ENAMEX> put on alternative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fare</ENAMEX>, offering jazz and chamber-music concerts as well as a chance to discover <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">playwrights</ENAMEX>.
Every effort is made to sustain an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Elizabethan</ENAMEX> atmosphere, with curtain times heralded by trumpeters in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> doublet and hose. Picnic in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Queen‚Äôs Park</ENAMEX> and give your crumbs to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ducks</ENAMEX> and swans on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Victoria Lake</ENAMEX>. A Shakespearean <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Garden</ENAMEX> displays the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> mentioned by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bard</ENAMEX> in his sonnets and plays.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Point Pelee National Park</ENAMEX>
At the southern end of the peninsula, indeed the southernmost point of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> mainland, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Point Pelee</ENAMEX> is one of the most distinctive of the country‚Äôs nature reserves. It‚Äôs on the same latitude as northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX>, and so endowed with a most un-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> climate and vegetation that offer a hospitable crossroads for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">347</NUMEX> species of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> on their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">biannual</TIMEX> north‚Äìsouth migrations.
‚ÄúBald point,‚Äù as <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> explorers dubbed it, is the southern <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20-km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">12-mile</NUMEX>) sandspit jutting out into <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lake Erie</ENAMEX>. Its terrain is a mixture of marshland, forest, meadows, and sandy beaches. Beginning with a lookout <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bird</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">watchers</ENAMEX>, a circular boardwalk takes you out onto the marshes to observe the flight of the redwing blackbird and purple <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">martin</ENAMEX>, while bittern stay tucked away in the reeds. Look, too, for the pretty pink-blossomed swamp rose-mallow, unique to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Point Pelee</ENAMEX>. Well-marked bicycle and hiking <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">trails</ENAMEX> wind through the woods, where you‚Äôll see hackberry, sassafras, sycamore, black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">walnut</ENAMEX>, and red <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">cedar</ENAMEX>, many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees draped</ENAMEX> with hanging vines reminiscent of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Carolinas</ENAMEX>.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the spring</TIMEX>, the great sport is fishing for smelt during their spawning run, ending <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">communal fish</ENAMEX>-fry on the beach. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September</TIMEX>, even before the leaves turn, <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> go bright orange with the wings of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Monarch butterflies</ENAMEX> on their way to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lakes Huron</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Superior</ENAMEX>
Ontario‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">playgrounds</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekend</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cottages</ENAMEX>, and marinas hug the shores and islands of the upper <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Great Lakes</ENAMEX>, offering resort hotel <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX>. The more adventurous <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">campers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hikers</ENAMEX>, and canoeists can explore the national and provincial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX> for a taste of the northern interior‚Äôs wilderness.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Georgian Bay</ENAMEX>
The bay practically forms a separate lake. These old stamping grounds of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Huron Indians</ENAMEX> (until they were decimated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iroquois</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">warriors</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> disease) are now a popular <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekend</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> destination for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toronto</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Midland</ENAMEX> is the center of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Huron</ENAMEX> region. Its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Huronia Museum</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Gallery of Historic Huronia</ENAMEX> and the copy of a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Huron</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Little Lake Park</ENAMEX> illustrate the simple lifestyle of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">native</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peoples</ENAMEX> before the arrival of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jesuits</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th century</TIMEX>. West of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sainte-Marie</ENAMEX> among the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hurons</ENAMEX> is a reconstruction of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jesuit</ENAMEX> mission built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1639</TIMEX>. Today, besides some (real) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Huron Indians</ENAMEX>, costumed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> show you how the community functioned with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priests</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">carpenters</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gardeners</ENAMEX>, and blacksmiths. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">It‚Äôs</ENAMEX> worth beginning your visit with the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">half-hour</TIMEX> documentary film to understand the dramatic fate of the mission. It must be said that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Huron</ENAMEX> were less interested in conversion to Christianity than in the goods to be gained from the fur <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> who followed the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priests</ENAMEX> on this <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> settlement in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ontario</ENAMEX>. But dealing directly with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Europeans</ENAMEX> threatened the position of the rival <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iroquois</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">middlemen</ENAMEX> between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Huron</ENAMEX> (and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algonquin</ENAMEX>) and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> down in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Albany</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iroquois</ENAMEX> killed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Huron</ENAMEX> in all-out war, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jesuits</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jean de Br√</ENAMEX>©beuf and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gabriel Lalemant</ENAMEX>, were tortured to death. To halt the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iroquois</ENAMEX> advance, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> burned their own <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> and returned to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qu√©bec.</ENAMEX>
The simple little <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Church of St. Joseph</ENAMEX> contains the tombs of the martyred <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">missionaries</ENAMEX>. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> outside the stockade depicts the life of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadians</ENAMEX>, including the artifacts and birchbark canoes of the fur <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX>.
The dramatic landscapes of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Georgian Bay Islands National Park</ENAMEX>, a particular favorite of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group of Seven</ENAMEX>, now attract <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fishermen</ENAMEX>, scuba <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">divers</ENAMEX>, and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">watersports</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enthusiasts</ENAMEX>. The bay‚Äôs islands are said to number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30,000</NUMEX>, if you include all the rocky outcrops and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>-clumped sandbanks, and the park includes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">77</NUMEX> of the most attractive of these islands.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Midland</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tobermory</ENAMEX> offer boat cruises and shuttle services out to individual islands. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beausoleil Island</ENAMEX>, off <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Honey Harbor</ENAMEX> just outside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Midland</ENAMEX>, is the focus or launching pad of the islands <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>, very well equipped for camping (there are no restaurant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> on any of the islands, so be sure to take your own supplies). The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tobermory Islands</ENAMEX> are renowned for their rock formations, most notably <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Flowerpot Island</ENAMEX>, where tall limestone <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monoliths</ENAMEX> have been eroded into bizarre vase-like shapes.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Thunder Bay</ENAMEX>
For <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vacationers</ENAMEX>, this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> strategically located on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lake Superior‚Äôs</ENAMEX> northwest shore is a springboard to the national <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ontario‚</ENAMEX>Äôs interior. But it‚Äôs also worth taking a look first at the impressive <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port facilities</ENAMEX> of this western <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terminus</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">St. Lawrence‚ÄìGreat Lakes Seaway</ENAMEX>, which has given <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Thunder Bay</ENAMEX> its <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> name: the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lakehead</ENAMEX>. Freighters come <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3,200 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,920 miles</NUMEX>) inland from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX> to take on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">grain</ENAMEX> shipments from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Prairie Provinces</ENAMEX> or bring other heavy cargo to all points west in both <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. Starting out from the centrally located <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North Marina</ENAMEX>, a harbor cruise takes you around the gigantic fortress-like <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">grain silos</ENAMEX> for a close-up view of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dock</ENAMEX>. A longer cruise from the same marina follows the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kaministikwia River</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Old Fort William</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20 minutes</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>), the handsomely reconstructed trading post of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nor‚ÄôWesters</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intrepid rivals</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hudson‚Äôs Bay Company</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>). Sheep graze the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">courtyard lawns</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bread</ENAMEX> is still made in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bakery</ENAMEX>, and the cookhouse provides lusty <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> fare. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company store</ENAMEX> you‚Äôll see the kind of simple <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">copper</ENAMEX> and pewter utensils and steel knives that were more precious than <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mid√©wiwin Indians</ENAMEX> bringing in their <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">beaver pelts</ENAMEX>.
Just up the road, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">40 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">25 miles</NUMEX>) northwest of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Thunder Bay</ENAMEX>, the beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kakabeka Falls</ENAMEX> is surrounded by its own provincial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> providing a quiet natural setting that‚Äôs a far cry from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Niagara</ENAMEX>. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boardwalk</ENAMEX> takes you through the woods along the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kaministikwia River</ENAMEX> and across a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX> for a view of the falls from both sides. The <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">151-m</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">154-ft</ENAMEX>) cascade flows at its fullest in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">spring</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">autumn</TIMEX> when the hydrostations don‚Äôt slow it down. There are good <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> for camping and bathing.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canoeists</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hikers</ENAMEX> really intent on getting away from civilization head <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two hours</TIMEX> west of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Thunder Bay</ENAMEX> along <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Highway 11</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Quetico Provincial Park</ENAMEX>. This is the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> through which the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Nor‚ÄôWesters‚Äô</ENAMEX> coureurs de bois paddled their way to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trappers‚</ENAMEX>Äô remote <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camps</ENAMEX>, adopting the natives‚Äô lore for tackling the wilderness, including their snowshoes, toboggans, and birchbark canoes. The indigenous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peoples</ENAMEX> have been here for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9,000 years</TIMEX> and have left their colored pictographs of moose, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">caribou</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bears</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">turtles etched</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">granite cliffs</ENAMEX>.
The only <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> into the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> leads to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Dawson Trail Campgrounds</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Lake¬†‚Äî¬†pleasant</ENAMEX> for a day‚Äôs picnic and swimming. For longer stays, the information <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> provides detailed maps of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quetico‚</ENAMEX>Äôs fantastic network of interlocking waterways. You can rent a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">canoe¬†‚Äî¬†no motor launches allowed¬†‚Äî¬†and</ENAMEX> fishing equipment (excellent pike, bass, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">trout</ENAMEX>) in the old mining and logging <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atikokan</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Ottawa</ENAMEX>
Like most national <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capitals</ENAMEX> created artificially to avoid favoring one established metropolis over another, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottawa</ENAMEX> is the perennial butt of carping and jokes. It‚Äôs true of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>, of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bras√≠lia</ENAMEX>, of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canberra</ENAMEX>, and even more so in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> where the very idea of a centralized federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> is so hotly contested by its independent-minded <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">provinces</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> rarely like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> at the best of times, and when it‚Äôs the town‚Äôs main, almost exclusive ‚Äúindustry,‚Äù they have a built-in prejudice against it.
But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ottawa‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> major source of income is nonetheless tourism, because the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> is pleasant, offering a pretty setting of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX> and waterways for its first-class <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX> and colorful monuments. The country‚Äôs short history is epitomized by a skyline of solid Victorian <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parliamentary buildings</ENAMEX> and a bold modern architecture of office <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">blocks</ENAMEX> and the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Gallery</ENAMEX>. And the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> machinery remains firmly in touch with its roots when in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bureaucrats</ENAMEX> skate and ski to work along the frozen <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Rideau Canal</ENAMEX>.
Accommodatingly situated on the border between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ontario</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qu√©bec</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottawa</ENAMEX> is a fully bilingual <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, though most of the French-speaking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> (and the best <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>) now have their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hull</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qu√</ENAMEX>©bec side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottawa River</ENAMEX>.
Except for longer excursions, try to leave the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> in the hotel parking lot and walk or take the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bus</ENAMEX>. The complex system of one-way <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> designed to avoid rather than to reach key government <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>, and the added confusion of curving rivers and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canals</ENAMEX>, make downtown driving a harrowing business even for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locals</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> other point: In the absence of any clear logic in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> numbering, it‚Äôs important when noting an address to be sure you have the nearest cross-<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> as well as the number of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parliament Area</ENAMEX>
Like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parliament</ENAMEX> assemblage in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> from which they unashamedly take their architectural inspiration, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parliament</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Buildings</ENAMEX> are an imposing Neo-Gothic pile restored from the ruins left after a devastating fire in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1916</TIMEX> (a current restoration is slated for completion in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year 2000</TIMEX>). They dominate the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottawa River</ENAMEX> from a bluff somewhat exaggeratedly known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parliament Hill</ENAMEX>. As a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterpart</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Westminster‚Äôs Big Ben</ENAMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">98-m</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">294-ft</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peace Tower</ENAMEX>, with clocks on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sides</ENAMEX> and a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">53</NUMEX>-bell <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">carillon</ENAMEX>, was built in front of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center Block</ENAMEX> as a monument to <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">I.</ENAMEX> Take the elevator to the observation deck for a fine view of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> from just below the clocks.
Guided tours take in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chambers</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> (in place of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Britain‚Äôs House of Lords</ENAMEX>) and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House of Commons</ENAMEX>. If you want to attend a debate, the tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Arts Centre</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">53</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Elgin Street</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Confederation Square</ENAMEX>) will advise you on how to get a permit. The handsome pine-paneled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Library</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parliament</ENAMEX>, north of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Centre Block</ENAMEX>, miraculously survived the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1916</TIMEX> fire. Beneath the formidable <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gothic</ENAMEX> rotunda, you‚Äôll see an imperial, almost goddess-like marble statue of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Victoria</ENAMEX> surrounded by more mortal early <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prime Ministers</ENAMEX>. Some of the latter‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> have been restored in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">East Block</ENAMEX>, which also survived the fire in its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1872</TIMEX> state.
Switching its echoes from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Westminster</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buckingham Palace</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parliament Hill</ENAMEX> provides pomp with a Changing of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Guard</ENAMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">125</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Governor General‚Äôs Foot Guards</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 23 to August 25, 2001</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:45 a.m</TIMEX>). On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> evenings, a sound and light show illuminates the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parliament</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Buildings</ENAMEX> to present, alternately in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>, a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30-minute</TIMEX> history of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Sparks Street Mall</ENAMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottawa</ENAMEX> to be paved and then the city‚Äôs, indeed the country‚Äôs, first traffic-free pedestrian zone, is a pleasant shopping area enlivened by street <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">musicians</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clowns</ENAMEX> and bordered by some first-class modern office <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>. Pride of place goes to the elegant <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>-story mirror-glass <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bank of Canada</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Kent</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Bank Streets</ENAMEX>) by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arthur Erickson</ENAMEX>. The green patina of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">building‚Äôs copper</ENAMEX> skeleton is an artful homage to the copper roofs on the old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parliament</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Buildings</ENAMEX>. Inside is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Currency Museum</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">78</NUMEX>). On the vast <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-sided <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Confederation Square¬</ENAMEX>†‚<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Äî¬†popularly</ENAMEX> known for its traffic congestion as <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚ÄúConfusion Square‚Äù¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†notice the great granite arch of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">National War Memorial</ENAMEX>, with its statues of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War I</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX> and a horse-drawn <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cannon</ENAMEX>. Ironically, it was dedicated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">George VI</ENAMEX> just <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three months</TIMEX> before the outbreak of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War</ENAMEX> II.

Getting a federal government‚Äôs priorities in proper perspective, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">parliament</ENAMEX> bemoaned the cultural <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> as ‚<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Äú50 years</TIMEX> ahead of its <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">time¬†‚Äî¬†that‚</ENAMEX>Äôs how long it‚Äôll take the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers</ENAMEX> to meet the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">500 percent</NUMEX> cost overrun.<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚Äù The formidable Ch√¢teau Laurier</ENAMEX>, (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1912</TIMEX>) a railway <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX> on the north side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>, is built in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> style much favored by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C.P.R.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C.N.R.</ENAMEX> for their luxury transcontinental hostelries. Local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> boast that the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Rideau Canal</ENAMEX>, which stretches <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">200 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">120 miles</NUMEX>) from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottawa River</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lake Ontario</ENAMEX>, qualifies in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> as ‚Äúthe world‚Äôs longest skating <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rink</ENAMEX>.‚Äù In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX>, it offers delightful boat cruises and canoeing, or you can explore its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX> with a rented <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bicycle</ENAMEX>.
On the edge of the parliamentary district, across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Rideau Canal</ENAMEX>, is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Byward Market</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">block</ENAMEX> east of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Sussex Drive</ENAMEX> and north of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Rideau Street</ENAMEX>). Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1846</TIMEX>, when it was a clearing house for nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX>, this has been the popular center of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, meeting place for the non-politicos. In its jolly, well-restored <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, only one of the market stalls dates as far back as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1867</TIMEX>, but the market retains much of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">its 19th-century</TIMEX> atmosphere. Quite apart from the colorful <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stalls</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetables</ENAMEX>, it‚Äôs a great place for breakfast, open even on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sundays</TIMEX> in a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> that otherwise closes down when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bureaucrats</ENAMEX> go home.
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Sussex Drive</ENAMEX>
This is the grand parade drive along the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottawa River</ENAMEX> to the town‚Äôs smartest residential neighborhood, home of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ministers</ENAMEX> and ‚ÄúEmbassy Row.‚Äù

The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catholic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cathedral‚Äôs steeples</ENAMEX> went up in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1858</TIMEX>, though the whole <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> was not completed until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1890</TIMEX>. Qu√©bec <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sculptors</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis Philippe H√©bert</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philippe Parizeau</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Flavien Rochon</ENAMEX> carved the pulpit, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">choir</ENAMEX> stalls, organ <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">loft</ENAMEX>, and bas-reliefs.
Turn off on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">St. Patrick Street</ENAMEX> to drive through <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nepean Point Park</ENAMEX> to a statue of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samuel de Champlain</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qu√©bec</ENAMEX>, who looks west along the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottawa River</ENAMEX> with his <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Huron Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scout</ENAMEX>. Here he still has the astrolabe that he lost on his explorations. and which gave its name to the nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Astrolabe Amphitheatre</ENAMEX>, attractive setting for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> open-air concerts.
Where the road crosses over the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rideau River</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Green Island</ENAMEX>, look for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rideau Falls</ENAMEX>, pouring its double <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">‚Äúcurtain‚Äù</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">French rideau</NUMEX>) of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> into the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottawa River</ENAMEX>. The windmill is part of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renewable Energy Exhibit</ENAMEX> of methods of gathering solar and wind energy.
For <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadians</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Sussex Drive</ENAMEX> has the same significance as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Downing Street</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX>. This grey stone <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> hidden behind the greenery is the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prime</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Minister‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX>.

Except on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> occasions, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guards</ENAMEX> in appropriately <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> uniforms will usually let you drive or walk in to admire the sweeping stretch of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">lawns</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gardens¬†‚Äî¬†look</ENAMEX> for the governor‚Äôs toboggan slide and skating <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rink</ENAMEX>.
The drive then circles around the immaculate gardens and fine <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansions</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rockcliffe Park</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">park‚Äôs driveway</ENAMEX> takes you out to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockcliffe Lookout</ENAMEX> for a spectacular view of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottawa River</ENAMEX> and the mouth of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gatineau</ENAMEX>. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Canadian Mounted Police Barracks</ENAMEX>, at the north end of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">St. Laurent Boulevard</ENAMEX>, you can see some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX> performing or training for the popular <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">RCMP Musical Ride</ENAMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> occasion when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mounties</ENAMEX> are still Mounties.

The august <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Victoria Memorial Building</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Metcalfe and McLeod Streets</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses museums</ENAMEX> created with the treasures uncovered by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Geological Survey</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1841</TIMEX>, predating the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">foundation</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> itself. The survey went beyond geology and mineralogy to study the uncharted <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">country‚Äôs paleontology</ENAMEX> and anthropology, its climate, forestry, and botany. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Museum of Natural Sciences</ENAMEX> in the east <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX>, the star attraction is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dinosaur Court</ENAMEX>, devoted to the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">75,000,000-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">beasts excavated</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alberta</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> is a good place to look at the country‚Äôs rich wildlife as a primer to your own explorations of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> forests and mountains.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Museum of Science and Technology</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1867</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">St. Laurent Boulevard</ENAMEX>) is in the style of science through fun and games.

But with all the new-fangled razzmatazz, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> hasn‚Äôt forgotten the charm of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mint</ENAMEX>-condition antique <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> and, above all, old train <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">engines¬†‚Äî¬†behemoths</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">great</ENAMEX> era of steam that truly ‚Äúmade‚Äù <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>.
In a similar vein, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Aviation Museum</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Rockcliffe Airport</ENAMEX> traces the history of aviation through the early flying machines, bi- and triplanes, and the great <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fighters</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> world wars.

The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canadian War Museum</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">330</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Sussex Drive</ENAMEX>, starts with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> warfare, including the battle prizes of scalps and skulls, and ends with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Normandy D</ENAMEX>-Day landings in <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War</ENAMEX> II. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Field Marshal G√∂ring‚</ENAMEX>Äôs armored <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mercedes Benz</ENAMEX> makes a nice latter-day battle prize. Weapons range from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clubs</ENAMEX> and tomahawks to the longer-range guided <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missiles</ENAMEX> of today‚Äôs armed forces.
Outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Currency Museum</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bank of Canada</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">245</NUMEX> Sparks Street, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Kent</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lyon</ENAMEX>) is a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">three-ton</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stone ‚Äúcoin‚Äù</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Caroline Islands in the Pacific</ENAMEX>. The smaller stuff is inside, including the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> currency of beads, wampum (black-and-white shells), and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beaver pelts</ENAMEX> and blankets, as well as the more familiar coinage and paper currency from colonial to modern times.

Just a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20-minute</TIMEX> drive across the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottawa River</ENAMEX> into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qu√©bec</ENAMEX>, and actually the most popular of excursions from the national capital, this <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">36,000-hectare</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">89,000-acre</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> of lakes and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">woodland</ENAMEX> covers an escarpment with dramatic lookouts over the plains of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottawa Valley</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">It‚Äôs</ENAMEX> named after the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hunter</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nicolas Gatineau</ENAMEX>, who first explored it, and its evergreen and deciduous forests are still the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">home</ENAMEX> of an abundant wildlife.
Go hiking or biking on well-planned nature <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">trails</ENAMEX> (details can be obtained from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Old Chelsea Visitors Center</ENAMEX>). Besides swimming at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> public beaches, you can rent canoes and rowboats for fishing on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philippe</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">La P√</ENAMEX>™che lakes. Visit <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kingsmere</ENAMEX>, the charming estate where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Lyon Mackenzie King</ENAMEX> spent his last <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>. As well as exploring the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">occult¬†‚Äî¬†he</ENAMEX> spoke to his departed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> through a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">crystal ball¬†‚Äî¬†Canada‚Äôs</ENAMEX> longest-serving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prime Minister</ENAMEX> liked to collect ‚Äúruins‚Äù on his many world travels.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eastern Ontario</ENAMEX>
The narrow arm of territory between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottawa</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Lawrence River</ENAMEX> lies at the historic heart of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Upper Canada</ENAMEX>. This was the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">home</ENAMEX> of early <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Loyalist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">settlers</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">Ships</ENAMEX> were built here to navigate the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Great Lakes</ENAMEX>, and later it became the site for the key section of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Lawrence Seaway</ENAMEX>, linking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montr√</ENAMEX>©al to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lake Ontario</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Upper Canada Village</ENAMEX>
Here, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">86 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">53 miles</NUMEX>) southeast of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottawa</ENAMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> strands of the region‚Äôs history come together in the meticulous recreation of a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19th-century</TIMEX> pioneering <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX>, perhaps the best of the country‚Äôs many historical showpieces. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> of the region‚Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">settlers</ENAMEX> had to be moved here, east of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morrisburg</ENAMEX>, when their original location was flooded in the digging of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Lawrence Seaway</ENAMEX>. Start your visit by climbing the small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">fort tower</ENAMEX>, from which you get an overall view. In a peaceful, green canalside setting disturbed only by perky <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> geese, notoriously loud honkers, you‚Äôll find authentic pre-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1867</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>, from the simple timbered sawmill or old schoolhouse to the sophisticated brick-built <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Crysler Hall</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Palladian</ENAMEX> style favored by colonial land <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ontario</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alabama</ENAMEX>. Crysler was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmer</ENAMEX> on whose land an important battle was fought in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">War of 1812</ENAMEX>, marked by a monument beside the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX>.
Period-costumed artisans demonstrate the crafts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX>: weaving, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bread-baking</ENAMEX>, plowing, and sowing. In the colonial setting of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Willard‚Äôs Hotel</ENAMEX>, you can enjoy a home-cooked hot <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meal</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salad</ENAMEX> lunch.

For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few years</TIMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1840s</TIMEX>, its location made <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kingston</ENAMEX> capital of pre-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Confederation Canada</ENAMEX>, and the sturdy, pillared <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">City Hall</ENAMEX> with its lofty <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dome</ENAMEX> pays due homage to an illustrious past. Behind, on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Market Square</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the weekend</TIMEX> market attracts the best of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Ontario‚Äôs fruit</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetables</ENAMEX> and the most brazen of the local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">musicians</ENAMEX>. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Thousand Islands</ENAMEX>
Reached most easily from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kingston</ENAMEX>, this archipelago of, in fact, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,700</NUMEX> islands are strung out along the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Lawrence River</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">nearly 80 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">48 miles</NUMEX>). You can go fishing, sailing, or lie back and enjoy a luxury <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three-day</TIMEX> cruise around the islands aboard the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Empress</ENAMEX> steamboat.
The island scenery is another painter‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">delight¬†‚Äî¬†the</ENAMEX> dark green of the spruces and silver birches against grey-and-pink granite <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">outcrops</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Millionaires</ENAMEX> such as songwriter <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Irving Berlin</ENAMEX> and cosmetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">queen</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helena Rubinstein</ENAMEX> made this their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">playground</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hideaway mansions</ENAMEX> known as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äúcottages</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äù One</ENAMEX> that escapes that euphemism is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boldt‚Äôs Castle</ENAMEX>, the kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gothic</ENAMEX> folly that magnates liked to dabble in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier this century</TIMEX>. In this case, it was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Boldt</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owner</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York‚Äôs Waldorf-Astoria Hotel</ENAMEX>. He built it for his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> but she died before it was finished, and it was abandoned as a vast empty <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">fortress</ENAMEX>, like those that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boldt</ENAMEX> admired in similar splendid ruin back home in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rhine Valley</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QUEBEC</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">If¬†‚Äî¬†oh</ENAMEX>, happy dream¬†‚Äî¬†all the old ethnic rivalries could be set aside, most <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadians</ENAMEX> would acknowledge that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qu√</ENAMEX>©bec is not only the ‚Äúoriginal‚Äù <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">settlement</ENAMEX>, but also the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX> that most comprehensively encompasses within its borders the world‚Äôs image of this huge <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. To begin with, it is itself huge: It could contain, according to your taste, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Frances</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Britains</ENAMEX>. Most of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">it¬†‚Äî¬†two</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thirds</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">area¬†‚Äî¬†is</ENAMEX> forest. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">north</ENAMEX> is coniferous, serving the province‚Äôs important pulp and paper industry, and the south is deciduous, with the maple of the national flag providing delicious <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">syrup</ENAMEX>, and the ash, <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">oak</ENAMEX>, and beech that blaze into crimson, amber, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">autumn</TIMEX>.
There aren‚Äôt as many beavers as in the great <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> of the fur trade, but still enough to fell a few <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> around the resort <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cottages</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Laurentian Mountains north of Montr√©al</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Deer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">moose</ENAMEX> abound for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hunters</ENAMEX>; farther north there are <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">herds</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">caribou</ENAMEX>, and, up towards the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Arctic Circle</ENAMEX>, a few <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">polar bears</ENAMEX>, too.
Where it‚Äôs not forest, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, or the farmland established by the habitants of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Lawrence Valley</ENAMEX> and the Eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Township Loyalists</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">it‚Äôs water</ENAMEX>, water everywhere. The mighty <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Lawrence River</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seaway</ENAMEX> link the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic Ocean</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Great Lakes</ENAMEX>. Gigantic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dams</ENAMEX> harness the water‚Äôs hydroelectric power north on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">James Bay</ENAMEX>, and east on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manicouagan River</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lakes</ENAMEX> and streams shimmer with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salmon</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">trout</ENAMEX>, eel, and pike.
As you travel from bilingual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montr√</ENAMEX>©al to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New France‚</ENAMEX>Äôs old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Qu√©bec City</ENAMEX> and the resolutely French-speaking farm <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> along the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Lawrence</ENAMEX> and around the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gasp√© Peninsula</ENAMEX>, have a thought for local patriotic sensibility. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Qu√©b√©cois</ENAMEX> can justly claim to be cofounders of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>. Abandoned by what many still call the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">‚Äúdamned French‚Äù</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">maudits fran√ßais</NUMEX>), they felt that they alone had earned the name of canadiens, and that their <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> conquerors usurped it. As a tribute to their own past courage, there is both pride and resentment in the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Qu√©b√©cois motto ‚ÄúJe me souviens‚Äù (‚ÄúI Remember‚Äù</ENAMEX>). It was they who made the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> and hardiest effort to hew a modern living out of this hard land. Like <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">colonials</ENAMEX> everywhere, their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">missionaries</ENAMEX> sometimes brought more religion, their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX>, and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX> more <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX> than the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">natives</ENAMEX> really needed. But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qu√</ENAMEX>©b√©cois understood the importance of learning from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">native</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peoples</ENAMEX> how best to handle the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> wilderness. Fur-trading coureurs de bois settled down with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wives</ENAMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> more than a few <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Qu√©b√©cois</ENAMEX> proudly trace their ancestry back to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">native</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peoples</ENAMEX> with a tell-tale birthmark on the hip, high cheekbones, or long sleek black hair.
Outside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Montr√©al</ENAMEX>, you can‚Äôt assume everyone speaks <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX>. Many make it a point of pride not to, until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">you‚</TIMEX>Äôve at least paid them the courtesy of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚ÄúBonjour</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚Äù By Qu√</ENAMEX>©bec provincial law, public signs are all in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>, and so we will often give you here, beside the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> names, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> version as it appears on maps and signposts.
Montr√©al
This great metropolis, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qu√©bec‚Äôs</ENAMEX> largest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.1 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhabitants</ENAMEX>, is built on an island at the confluence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottawa</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Lawrence</ENAMEX> rivers. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> now to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toronto</ENAMEX>, it remains a sprawling <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of cosmopolitan neighborhoods, each a delight to stroll around but best reached by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">taxi</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bus</ENAMEX>, or the excellent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M√©tro</ENAMEX>, where the trains whoosh along on rubber tires. Given the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daytime</TIMEX> traffic snarls and usual big-city parking problems, use your <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> only for out-of-town trips.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mount Royal</ENAMEX>
For an overall view of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, start with a bracing walk up the slopes of the charming <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mount Royal Park</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Parc du Mont</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal</ENAMEX>). Follow the footpath and stairs from the end of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Peel Street</ENAMEX> or a shorter route from the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Chemin Remembrance</TIMEX> car <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>. Perhaps the most pleasant way is to take a leisurely ride in a horse-drawn <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">carriage</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dominion Square</ENAMEX>.
Known with characteristic local irony as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">la Montagne</ENAMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mountain</ENAMEX>), the heights were spotted by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacques Cartier</ENAMEX> on his historic journey up the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Lawrence River</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1535</TIMEX>, and named <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mont R√</ENAMEX>©al in homage to his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fran√ßois I.</ENAMEX>
From the massive timber and stone <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chalet de la Montagne</ENAMEX> or the steel cross at the summit (illuminated at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>), you can look out over the river flowing from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lac des Deux Montagnes</ENAMEX> past the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">its northeasterly</TIMEX> journey to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX>. Montr√©alers conveniently twist the compass by considering the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Lawrence</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚Äúsouth‚Äù</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>; the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX> parallel to the river are divided into <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚Äúeast‚Äù</ENAMEX> and ‚Äúwest‚Äù <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sectors</ENAMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Boulevard St-Laurent</ENAMEX>. Down by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port</ENAMEX> are the low stone <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Old Montr√©al</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vieux Montr√©al</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">concrete</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steel</ENAMEX>, and glass <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">towers</ENAMEX> of the modern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> cluster around <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Boulevard Ren√© L√©vesque</ENAMEX>, which runs parallel to the river. At the far end, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Jacques-Cartier Bridge links Montr√©al Island</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Expo ‚Äô67</ENAMEX> site on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">St. Helen‚Äôs Island</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ile Ste-H√©l√®ne</ENAMEX>) and over to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúsouthern‚Äù shore</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Victoria Bridge</ENAMEX> spans the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Lawrence</ENAMEX> to the south.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southwest of Mount Royal</ENAMEX>, on the slopes of the smaller hill of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Westmount</ENAMEX>, are the grand villas and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansions</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montr√</ENAMEX>©al‚Äôs old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglo-Canadian √©lite.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North</ENAMEX> and west of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> are many of the city‚Äôs ethnic neighborhoods and the chic French-speaking <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">township</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Outremont</ENAMEX>. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the clearest days</TIMEX>, you may spot the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Laurentian Mountains</ENAMEX> to the northeast and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Green Mountains</ENAMEX> across the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> border in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vermont</ENAMEX>.
Landscaped by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frederick Law Olmsted</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designer</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York‚Äôs Central Park</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mount Royal</ENAMEX> is a popular refuge from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> bustle, the place for picnics in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX> and tobogganing and skiing in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the winter</TIMEX>, with the little <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Beaver Lake</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lac des Castors</ENAMEX>) for sailing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model boats</ENAMEX> (or skating). A stroll around the lake is the perfect way to capture a sense of the town‚Äôs ethnic diversity. On the park benches, you may hear gossip not only in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, but <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Yiddish</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Russian</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Old Montr√</ENAMEX>©al
Between rue <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">St-Antoine</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX> and flanked by rue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McGill</ENAMEX> and rue <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berri</ENAMEX>, this is the site of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maisonneuve‚</ENAMEX>Äôs original settlement of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ville-Marie</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">M√©tro Champ-de-Mars</ENAMEX>). All but a few <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stones</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 18th-century</TIMEX> city ramparts have gone, but many historic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> have been restored to evoke some of the flavor of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New France</ENAMEX>.
The colorful, tree-lined Place <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacques-Cartier</ENAMEX> makes a good point from which to start a walking tour (or a riding tour in a horse-drawn cal√®che available here for hire). An itinerary can be mapped out over <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the many pleasant <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sidewalk caf√©s</ENAMEX>. Once a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX> and vegetable market, the cobblestone <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> remains a favorite venue for flower-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendors</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">itinerant artists</ENAMEX>. The old stone <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> were designed to beat the harsh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winters</TIMEX> with distintive, tall, steep-sloping roofs to keep the weighty snow and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> from accumulating.
Across the rue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Notre-Dame</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">H√¥tel de Ville</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">City Hall</ENAMEX>) is built in the imposing style of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">French Renaissance</ENAMEX>. It was from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">balcony</ENAMEX> beneath the clock in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1967</TIMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">General</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Gaulle</ENAMEX> delivered his incendiary cry of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚ÄúVive le Qu√</ENAMEX>©bec libre!,‚Äù warming the hearts of local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">separatists</ENAMEX>. The general was not intimidated by the statue of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lord</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Horatio Nelson</ENAMEX> watching him from the top of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Place Jacques-Cartier</ENAMEX>. Montr√©al‚Äôs oldest monument was somewhat provocatively erected in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1809</TIMEX>, just <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four years</TIMEX> after the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> admiral‚Äôs devastating defeat of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trafalgar</ENAMEX>.
Diagonally opposite the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H√¥tel de Ville</ENAMEX> on rue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Notre-Dame</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ch√¢teau Ramezay</ENAMEX> was home of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Claude de Ramezay</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1705 to 1724</TIMEX>. It passed successively into the hands of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">French West Indies Trading Company</ENAMEX> (to store its <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spices</ENAMEX>), the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX>, and, during their brief occupation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1775</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generals</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Montgomery</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Benedict Arnold</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Benjamin Franklin</ENAMEX> stayed here during his fruitless attempt to win <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qu√©bec</ENAMEX> over to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> cause. After years of neglect, the ch√¢teau has been restored and transformed into a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> showing a more comfortable side of frontier life in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New France</ENAMEX>: elegant <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th-century</TIMEX> furnishings, a grand colonial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">basement</ENAMEX>, and the nice added touch of magnificent carved mahogany paneling imported from the old trading company‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>. Iroquois clothes and artifacts give a hint of life outside the stockade.
The rue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bonsecours</ENAMEX> is one of the principal historic residential <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> leading from rue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Notre-Dame</ENAMEX> towards the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vieux Port</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Old Port</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maison Papineau</ENAMEX> (Number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">440</NUMEX>), distinguished by its double row of gabled garrets in the roof, dates back to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1785</TIMEX>. It is the family <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> of the controversial <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politician</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis-Joseph Papineau</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> of the militant patriotes but also cautious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">protector</ENAMEX> of his seigneurial property (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX>). In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1837</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> nearly burned down in a violent riot, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX> had to come to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Papineau‚Äôs</ENAMEX> rescue. He fled to the countryside and did not take part in the subsequent insurrection.
On the corner of rue <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">St-Paul</ENAMEX>, the older <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maison du Calvet</ENAMEX> was built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1725</TIMEX> by a prominent <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Huguenot</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">merchant</ENAMEX>. As a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Protestant</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierre du Calvet</ENAMEX> was appointed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">justice</ENAMEX> of the peace but then ended up in jail himself for selling supplies and information to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> invaders. With its broad chimney, fine-grained limestone frames around the doors, and gracefully tapered casement windows, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> is one of the more handsome architectural specimens of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> colonial era. The sturdy interior of wide, rough-hewn floorboards and massive pinewood roofbeams is fitted out from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montr√©al Museum of Fine Arts</ENAMEX> with antique <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Qu√©bec</ENAMEX> furniture, rugs, lanterns, clocks, and porcelain appropriate to the life of a wealthy <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">businessman</ENAMEX>. A framed copy of the bilingual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qu√©bec Gazette</ENAMEX>, dating from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1786</TIMEX>, suggests that colonials of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New World</ENAMEX> had an uncommon interest in the more arcane news of international events in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Old World</ENAMEX>, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Turkey‚Äôs</ENAMEX> troubles with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venice</ENAMEX> or the quarrels of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> royal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>.
Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1772</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Notre-Dame</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de-Bonsecours</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</NUMEX> rue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Est</ENAMEX>, has stood on the site of a chapel that was built for the colony‚Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">schoolteacher</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marguerite Bourgeois</ENAMEX>, but destroyed by fire. She and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman companions</ENAMEX> brought a civilizing influence to the harshness of the beleaguered settlement. Acting as both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurses</ENAMEX>, they also took charge of marriageable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> known as the filles <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">du Roi</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">‚ÄúKing‚Äôs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughters</ENAMEX>.‚Äù The filles <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">du Roi</ENAMEX> were in fact <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughters</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peasants</ENAMEX> and poor artisans, shipped over from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wives</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bachelor farmers</ENAMEX> and fur <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th century</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Notre-Dame</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de-Bonsecours</ENAMEX> became the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">‚ÄúSailors‚Äô Chapel</ENAMEX>,‚Äù to which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">survivors</ENAMEX> of shipwrecks brought <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model ships</ENAMEX> they had carved as offerings of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thanksgiving</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> still hang from the ceiling, lit up <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">now</TIMEX> by tiny electric bulbs. <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Notice</ENAMEX> how the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">trompe l‚Äôoeil</ENAMEX> painting on the low arched ceiling aspires to turn the little <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> into a lofty <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Gothic cathedral</ENAMEX>. Climb the church <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> for a good view of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vieux Montr√©al</ENAMEX> and the harbor.
Most of the ugly old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">warehouses</ENAMEX> have been demolished along the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vieux Port</ENAMEX> at the foot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Place Jacques-Cartier</ENAMEX>. Some have been refurbished as caf√©s or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pier</ENAMEX> now houses the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cirque du Soleil</ENAMEX>, another an IMAX theater. Take a walk along the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Pointe √† Calli√®res</ENAMEX>, where the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ville-Marie</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">settlers</ENAMEX> first landed. An obelisk on the nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Place Royale</ENAMEX> commemorates their adventure. The statue at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Pointe</ENAMEX> is of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglo</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Young</ENAMEX>, who developed the port‚Äôs commerce in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th century</TIMEX>.
The rue <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">St-Sulpice</ENAMEX> takes you over the Place d‚ÄôArmes, close to the site of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> battles with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iroquois</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> it serves as a visual link between the historic old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pioneers</ENAMEX> and the new <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of commerce and industry. In the middle is a statue of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maisonneuve</ENAMEX>, looking very like one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alexandre Dumas‚</ENAMEX>Äô musketeers. He‚Äôs brandishing the royal <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> fleur-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">de</ENAMEX>-lys flag that inspired the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Qu√©bec</ENAMEX> provincial flag of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">The 19th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Neo-Gothic Notre-Dame Basilica</ENAMEX> was designed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James O‚ÄôDonell</ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Irish Protestant New Yorker</ENAMEX> so inspired by his assignment that he converted to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catholicism</ENAMEX>. It once took <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> to ring the great bell in the west <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX>, a task now accomplished with electricity. The garishly opulent interior was the work of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Qu√©b√©cois</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Victor Bourgeau</ENAMEX>. Our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lady</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Sacred Heart Chapel</ENAMEX>, behind the main altar, unites modern and traditional religious art in a more intimate setting for marriages and memorial services. A little <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> displays church sculpture and painting, notably some almost surreal works by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierre-Adolphe-Arthur Guindon</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Sulpician</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">monk</ENAMEX>. Next to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Seminary of St-Sulpice</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montr√</ENAMEX>©al‚Äôs oldest surviving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">edifice</ENAMEX>, built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1685</TIMEX> to lead the missionary work among the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iroquois</ENAMEX>. It also boasts <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North America‚</ENAMEX>Äôs oldest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> clock (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1710</TIMEX>).
The Place d‚ÄôArmes is enclosed on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sides</ENAMEX> by modern <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>, including the huge <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> Office <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX>, while opposite <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Notre-Dame</ENAMEX> stands the venerable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bank of Montr√©al</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1847</TIMEX>). The black marble and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brass</ENAMEX> of its monumental entrance hall impose a pious appreciation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canada‚</ENAMEX>Äôs oldest banking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX>. The statue of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Patria</ENAMEX> is dedicated to the fallen of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">I.</ENAMEX> Take a peek, too, around the grand Exchange Room, awe-inspiring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relic</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the days</TIMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> money was in the hands of august <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gentlemen</ENAMEX>, before they handed it over to those slick young <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golden Boys of Toronto</ENAMEX>. A little banking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> shows the way it used to be, complete with a teller‚Äôs window in the style of the bank‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">foundation</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1817</TIMEX>.
Back down by the river, Place d‚ÄôYouville, named after a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX> who established here the charitable order of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grey Nuns</ENAMEX>, offers a quieter, more romantic end to your tour of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vieux Montr√©al.</ENAMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Youville Stables</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Ecuries d‚ÄôYouville</NUMEX>) are an enchanting collection of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 19th-century</TIMEX> grey-stone <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">gabled buildings</ENAMEX> now containing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> looking out onto a peaceful garden. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX>-shaped <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX> makes a lovely setting for open-air plays and recitals in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äústables‚Äù</ENAMEX> were in fact nothing more romantic than a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">warehouse</ENAMEX>, but they did for a time serve as a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garage</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horse</ENAMEX>-carriages. Next to the stables is an old red-brick fire <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX> transformed into the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Montr√©al History Center</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Centre d‚Äôhistoire de Montr√©al</ENAMEX>), presenting an audiovisual documentary history of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>.
Downtown
The nucleus of downtown <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Montr√</ENAMEX>©al is located between <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Boulevard Ren√© L√©vesque and Sherbrooke Street</ENAMEX> running parallel to the river, bounded by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guy</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">St-Denis Streets</ENAMEX>. It is best characterized by its bold new office <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">skyscrapers</ENAMEX>, cultural <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX>, and shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX>, crowding in on a die-hard bunch of old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX>, and all-night delicatessens.
Start at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Square Dorchester</ENAMEX>, where the horse-drawn cal√®ches wait (they are also rather nicely known as hippomobiles). <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Artists</ENAMEX> and flower <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendors</ENAMEX> sell their wares around <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Henry Moore‚Äôs sculpture Reclining Nude</ENAMEX> and more austere statues of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Scottish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Burns</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prime Ministers</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilfrid Laurier</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John MacDonald</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sun Life</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">skyscraper</ENAMEX>, built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1933</TIMEX>, is the city‚Äôs oldest. There‚Äôs a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> city tourist information kiosk on the south side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> and a year-round <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> north of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1010</TIMEX> rue <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ste-Catherine Ouest</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northeast</ENAMEX> along <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Boulevard Ren√© L√©vesque</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catholic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cathedral</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montr√©al</ENAMEX>, something of a visual oddity, at least for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">cathedral of Marie-Reine-du-Monde</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Queen</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World</ENAMEX>) is a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19th-century</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-size replica of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Peter‚Äôs Basilica</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Half</NUMEX>-size but still massive enough¬<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">†‚Äî¬†inside</ENAMEX>, the nave is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">109 m</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">328 ft</ENAMEX>) long, the transept is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">73 m</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">220 ft</ENAMEX>) long, and the vault of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dome</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">83 m</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">250 ft</ENAMEX>) high. Beneath that <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dome</ENAMEX>, over the high altar, is another replica of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Peter‚Äôs</ENAMEX>: Bernini‚Äôs celebrated gilded bronze canopy. Unfortunately, there is nothing to match <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bernini‚</ENAMEX>Äôs great square to give you a proper perspective, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> is dwarfed by the huge <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Queen Elizabeth Hotel</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sun Life</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">skyscraper</ENAMEX>.
The new gigantism continues with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Place Ville-Marie</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1962</TIMEX>), dominated by the other side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Queen Elizabeth</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canadian National Railway‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Central Station</ENAMEX>, and the soaring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Bank</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>, an intersecting cross-shaped <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> designed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">I.M. Pei</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Qu√©bec</ENAMEX> provincial tourist information <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> is at the northern corner of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>, near the intersection of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peel</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">St. Catherine Street</ENAMEX> West.
But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Place Ville-Marie</ENAMEX> is, above all, the starting point of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montr√©al‚Äôs</ENAMEX> vast underground <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, which acts as an ecological punchline to the joke of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qu√</ENAMEX>©bec <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX>. In self-defense against <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five or six months</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">snow</ENAMEX>, and slush, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pedestrians</ENAMEX> frequent a complete alternative <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, cinemas, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">nightclubs</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, and caf√©s. Hotel <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> can spend a whole night out on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the winter months</TIMEX> without overcoat or galoshes. And it‚Äôs almost as popular on a sweltering day in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July</TIMEX>. Some <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">30 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">15 miles</NUMEX>) of subterranean <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">galleries</ENAMEX> (linked by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M√©tro</ENAMEX>) stretch across the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, taking in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Place Ville-Marie and Place Bonaventure</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Les Terrasses</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Place des Arts</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Complexe Desjardins</ENAMEX>, and even passing under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Lawrence River</ENAMEX> to the suburb of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Longueuil</ENAMEX> on the south shore.
Above ground, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rue</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ste-Catherine</ENAMEX> is the city‚Äôs main shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">thoroughfare¬†‚Äî¬†department stores</ENAMEX>, cinemas, travel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>, delicatessens, and bars¬†‚Äî¬†more popular than chic, but always lively. At the corner of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">University Street the Anglican cathedral of Christ Church</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1859</TIMEX>) is a classic piece of elegant <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English Gothic¬†‚Äî¬†take</ENAMEX> a look inside at the fine stone sculpture on the high altar.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crescent Street</ENAMEX>, with neighboring <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mountain</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montagne</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Bishop Streets</ENAMEX>, is one of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Montr√©al‚Äôs</ENAMEX> more fashionable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boutique</ENAMEX> and bistro areas. The Victorian stone row <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> have escaped demolition and have been lovingly refurbished and brightly painted for conversion into off-beat <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">art galleries</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bars</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">singles crowd</ENAMEX>.
These rejuveniated <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> make an appropriate transition from Ste-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Catherine</ENAMEX> to the elegance of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Sherbrooke Street</ENAMEX>. With the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum of Fine Arts</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">105</NUMEX>) near the intersection of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Crescent Street</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sherbrooke</ENAMEX> is the town‚Äôs main ‚Äúgallery row,‚Äù where high-priced <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antiques</ENAMEX>, jewelry, silverware, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oriental</ENAMEX> carpet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> mingle. 
Even if you‚Äôre not staying here, the ritzy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ritz-Carlton Hotel</ENAMEX> makes a fine rendezvous for a restful or bracing cocktail in mid-sightseeing. Opposite the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McCord Museum</ENAMEX> of local history (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">106</NUMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McGill University</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Montr√©al‚Äôs internationally renowned</ENAMEX> English-speaking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">university</ENAMEX>.
Founded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 19th century</TIMEX> by a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Scottish</ENAMEX> fur <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">James McGill</ENAMEX>, and especially respected for its engineering and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine faculties</ENAMEX>, it has a student enrollment of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15,000</NUMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1969</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qu√</ENAMEX>©b√©cois <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">separatists</ENAMEX> staged violent but unsuccessful demonstrations to have it transformed into a French-speaking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX>. (The city‚Äôs other English-speaking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">college</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Concordia</ENAMEX> while the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Universit√© de Montr√©al</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Universit√© du Qu√©bec √† Montr√©al</ENAMEX> are both French-speaking).
Between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maisonneuve</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">R. L√</ENAMEX>©vesque boulevards, art and commerce come together at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Place des Arts and Complexe Desjardins</ENAMEX>. The modern cultural <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> is comprised of a concert <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">theaters</ENAMEX>, and a recital room for chamber music. At the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Salle Wilfrid-Pelletier</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">175</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rue</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ste-Catherine Ouest</ENAMEX>, home of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montr√©al Symphony Orchestra</ENAMEX>, the elegant tone of the whole <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> is set in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">foyer</ENAMEX> decorated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aubusson</ENAMEX> tapestries and sculptures in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bronze</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mahogany</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aluminum</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ceramics</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Notice</ENAMEX> above the concert <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX> doors the soapstone carvings of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Inuit</ENAMEX> sculptor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yununkpuk</ENAMEX>.
Across rue <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ste-Catherine</ENAMEX>, you pass through the imposing glass portals of the attractive multilevel shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Complexe Desjardins</ENAMEX>, opened in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1976</TIMEX> during the grand building spree of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Montr√©al Olympic Games</ENAMEX>. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Montr√©al‚Äôs Neighborhoods</ENAMEX>
From a local point of view, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vieux Montr√</ENAMEX>©al is a tourist attraction for the landmarks of the city‚Äôs historical beginnings, while downtown is for business and special <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">nights</TIMEX> out. But the real color and spice of the people‚Äôs everyday life is to be found in their neighborhoods.
And you‚Äôll find in the architecture the missing links between the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>-inspired <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vieux Montr√©al</ENAMEX> and the international anonymity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> center‚Äôs <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">skyscrapers</ENAMEX>. While the bourgeoisie‚Äôs red-brick or stone <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> are clearly inspired by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Georgian</ENAMEX> and Victorian <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> and grander <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residences</ENAMEX> by the country <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> and ch√¢teaux of continental <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, the working-class row <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> with outside iron <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">staircases</ENAMEX> leading to upper floors (thus saving <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">space</ENAMEX> inside) are a more characteristic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montr√</ENAMEX>©al feature.
Almost a neighborhood all to itself, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boulevard St-Laurent</ENAMEX> used to mark the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äúborder‚Äù</ENAMEX> between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglo</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadians</ENAMEX> to the west and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadians</ENAMEX> to the east. Anglos call it <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚Äúthe Main‚Äù</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadians</ENAMEX> make a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">nice¬†‚Äî¬†and rare¬†‚Äî¬†compromise</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚Äúla Main</ENAMEX>.‚Äù The neighborhood <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lines</ENAMEX> have blurred in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX>, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Main</ENAMEX> stays appropriately neutral, a veritable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Nations</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Portuguese</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Polish</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> specialty <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, grocery <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX>, delicatessens, and caf√©s. Gourmets make a special pilgrimage down a little side-<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Waldman‚Äôs fish</ENAMEX> market.
French-speaking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Universit√© du</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Qu√©bec √† Montr√</ENAMEX>©al meet in caf√©s, bistros, and bookshops along rue <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">St-Denis</ENAMEX>. Here and around the tree-shaded <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Square St-Louis</ENAMEX>, nicely restored or equally nicely battered <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Victorian</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">gingerbread mansions</ENAMEX> and iron-staircased row <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> fight a picturesque rear-guard action against the encroachment of the modern red-brick blocks of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">university</ENAMEX>. At the West End of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>, rue <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prince-Arthur</ENAMEX> has been transformed into a pleasant tile-paved <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pedestrian mall</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boutiques</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> is also one of the town‚Äôs livelier night-time hangouts for jazz and folk music.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boulevard St-Laurent</ENAMEX> below <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L√©vesque</ENAMEX>, squeezed out by the urban redevelopment around the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Complexe Guy-Favreau</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palais des Congr√®s</ENAMEX>, the compact little <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Chinatown</ENAMEX> huddles into a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>-block area around rue <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de la Gaucheti√®re</ENAMEX>. Some of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">descendants</ENAMEX> of the valiant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">laborers</ENAMEX> who helped build the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canadian Pacific Railway</ENAMEX>.
Seek out <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Montr√©al‚Äôs Little Italy north of Mount Royal</ENAMEX> around the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jean-Talon</ENAMEX> Market on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Place du March√© du Nord</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M√</ENAMEX>©tro <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jean-Talon</ENAMEX>). The best trattorias in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> are here, blessedly not the most expensive. The raucous market gives a distinctively <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> flavor to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetables</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Qu√©bec</ENAMEX> countryside. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greeks</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 50,000</NUMEX> strong, have mostly chosen the area around the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avenue du Parc</ENAMEX>, east of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Outremont</ENAMEX>, for their caf√©s and tavernas. 
With <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>- and third-generation prosperity, most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> have moved on from the rue <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">St-Urbain</ENAMEX> neighborhood made famous by the writings of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mordecai Richler</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz</ENAMEX>) to make way gradually for an equally colorful <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX>. A nearby monument of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> folklore that no amount of urban upheavals can seem to budge is the ever-crowded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schwartz‚Äôs Delicatessen</ENAMEX> (officially called <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Montr√©al Hebrew</ENAMEX> Delicatessen) located at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3895</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Boulevard St-Laurent</ENAMEX>. Assimilating more easily with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglo</ENAMEX> community¬†‚Äî¬†only <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Protestant</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> accepted their children¬†‚Äî¬†Eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> have ‚Äúgraduated‚Äù to wealthy <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Westmount</ENAMEX> or emigrated, again, to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toronto</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French-speaking Jews</ENAMEX>, more recent arrivals from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North Africa</ENAMEX>, have settled in middle-class <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Outremont</ENAMEX>.
On the north side of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mount Royal</ENAMEX>, beyond the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chemin de la C√¥te-Ste-Catherine</ENAMEX>, the handsome villas of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Outremont</ENAMEX> make up the favored neighborhood of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bourgeoisie</ENAMEX>, in fact an independent <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">township</ENAMEX> situated within <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Montr√©al‚Äôs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> borders. Originally an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglo</ENAMEX> stronghold, part of it is still known even among <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Upper-Outremont</ENAMEX>, family <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> of that splendidly ambiguous <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prime minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierre Elliott Trudeau</ENAMEX>. The ‚Äúlower‚Äù part of this independent <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">township</ENAMEX> has a breezy <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>-life, especially among the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sidewalk caf√©s</ENAMEX> on rue <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bernard</ENAMEX>.
And where have all the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglos</ENAMEX> gone? Many of the upper-middle-class variety are holding out in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Westmount</ENAMEX>. This bastion of the old <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Montr√©al √©lite</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> origin became a prime target for the more violent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the separatist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Front de lib√©ration du Qu√©bec</ENAMEX>, who in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">1960s</NUMEX> set off bombs in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Westmount‚</ENAMEX>Äôs mailboxes. Those not put off by this can still be seen in tweeds and cavalry twill, walking their <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> around <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Summit Park</ENAMEX>, where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Belvedere</ENAMEX> affords a fine view of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Head</ENAMEX> for the tree-lined <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Summit Road, Summit Crescent</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Summit Circle</ENAMEX> and you‚Äôll spot their ivy-covered <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansions</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">grey-stone turreted ch√</ENAMEX>¢teaux <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-concealed behind <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> and shrubbery at the top of a grassy slope. The architecture here is a wonderful compendium of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French Romanesque</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">German Gothic</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Westmount Square</ENAMEX> gives you a sharp but not inelegant jolt back into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 20th century</TIMEX>, with the black <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steel</ENAMEX> and glass office <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mies van der Rohe</ENAMEX>.
Dominating the skyline beyond <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Westmount</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C√¥te-des-Neiges</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. Joseph‚Äôs Oratory</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oratoire St-Joseph</ENAMEX>) receives <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to 2 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catholic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilgrims</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each year</TIMEX>. The huge <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">sanctuary</ENAMEX>, which holds <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13,000</NUMEX> worshippers, commemorates the healing powers of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brother Andr√©.</ENAMEX> Born <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alfred Bessette</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1845</TIMEX>, one of a poor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Qu√©b√©cois</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brother Andr√©</ENAMEX> was gatekeeper at the monastic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Congregation</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holy Cross</ENAMEX>. He administered to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sick</ENAMEX> in a small wooden chapel that he himself erected; it is still standing near the transept of the present oratory. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Over a million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">faithful</ENAMEX> attended his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">funeral</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1937</TIMEX>. His tomb is in the crypt. The best time to enjoy the bright and airy simplicity of the oratory‚Äôs modern interior is at the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> organ recitals.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Olympic Park</ENAMEX>
Situated east of downtown opposite <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maisonneuve Park</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M√©tro Pie</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IX</NUMEX>), the impressive complex of sports <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> built specifically for the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1976</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Olympic Games</ENAMEX> is an eloquent monument to the visions of grandeur that characterized <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mayor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jean Drapeau</ENAMEX>. After the sweeping (some would say devastating) downtown redevelopment and the ambitious construction on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Lawrence River</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Expo ‚</ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Äô67</NUMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Olympic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Park</ENAMEX> was to be the apotheosis of his <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúnew Montr√©al</ENAMEX>.‚Äù As you can see on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> guided tours through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Olympic Park</ENAMEX>, the result is as grandiose in design as it has been ruinous in cost, to the continuing chagrin of local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers</ENAMEX> with long memories and short bank balances. Centerpiece is the mammoth <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Olympic Stadium</ENAMEX>, seating <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spectators</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> games of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montr√©al Expos</ENAMEX> baseball <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> and rock‚Äòn‚Äôroll concerts. 
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the most popular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">V√©lodrome</ENAMEX>, with a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">redwood track</ENAMEX> for cycling and roller-skating around a central arena for <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">boxing</ENAMEX>, wrestling, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">basketball</ENAMEX>, with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX>-skating in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX>. (Montr√©al‚Äôs legendary ice hockey <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canadiens</ENAMEX>, plays at the other end of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Molson Centre</ENAMEX>, a new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">arena</ENAMEX> near <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Place Bonaventure</ENAMEX>.) Beside the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Olympic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Park</ENAMEX> across <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Sherbrooke Street</ENAMEX> are the city‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Botanical Gardens</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4101</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sherbrooke East</ENAMEX>. This delightful <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">oasis</ENAMEX> of greenery boasts some <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26,000</NUMEX> species of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> from all over the world, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lovingly</ENAMEX> tended to resist the rigors of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qu√</ENAMEX>©bec climate. A miniature railway takes you around the gardens. Among the highlights are magnificent <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">orchids</ENAMEX> and cacti in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">greenhouses</ENAMEX> and an exquisite arboretum of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> bonsai. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Lawrence River</ENAMEX>
After years of hiding the river behind a bleak expanse of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">warehouses</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factories</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">railway tracks</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montr√©al</ENAMEX> has opened up its waterfront, more recently with the music festivals and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">flea</ENAMEX> market of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vieux Port</ENAMEX>, but largely at the earlier instigation of that much maligned <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mayor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Drapeau</ENAMEX>.
Expo <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚Äô67</NUMEX> provided the major breakthrough with the choice of the river‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ile Ste-H√©l√®ne</ENAMEX> as the principal site for the international pavilions. The former <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pavilion</ENAMEX> has been converted into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Biosphere</ENAMEX>, an ecology-oriented <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings house</ENAMEX> a new casino. The fun and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adventure</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World‚Äôs Fair</ENAMEX> are perpetuated with outdoor concerts, exhibits, and films on ecology, urban life, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> history, and the technology of the future.
In the middle of the island, close to where the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX> burned its flags in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Montr√©al‚Äôs</ENAMEX> military capitulation to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1760</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">D.M. Stewart Museum</ENAMEX> is a restoration of the fort commissioned by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Duke</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wellington</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60 years later</TIMEX>. The military drills and parades staged here in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX> by uniformed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> pay appropriate homage to both <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> (more precisely, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scots Highlander</ENAMEX>) tradition. The fort‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Military and Maritime Museum</ENAMEX> displays <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ship models</ENAMEX>, maps, navigational instruments, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Canada‚Äôs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX> and uniforms from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th century</TIMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War</ENAMEX> II. <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Beyond Jacques Cartier Bridge</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Ronde</ENAMEX> amusement <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> plays every imaginable ultramodern variation on the swings and roundabouts of a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> fair. Put the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gyrotron</ENAMEX> whirligig or Aquapark waterslide and watch (or forget about them) from the beer garden. The closest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montr√</ENAMEX>©al can take you to the tropics is among its exotic fish in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Aquarium</ENAMEX> on the other side of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dolphin Lake</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lac des Dauphins</ENAMEX>) from the waterslide <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX> (leading from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Ste-H√©l√®ne M√©tro</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX>) crosses over to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ile Notre-Dame</ENAMEX>. This artificial island built from landfill dredged for <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canal</ENAMEX> construction has been embellished by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Les Floralies</ENAMEX> flower <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> in the center of a circuit for <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Grand Prix motor</ENAMEX> racing. On the island‚Äôs southern tip, beyond the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Victoria Bridge</ENAMEX>, you can climb an observation <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> for a view of the highly impressive <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">St. Lambert Lock</ENAMEX>, a key point on the great <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Lawrence Seaway</ENAMEX>.
From the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cit√© du Havre</ENAMEX> north of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Victoria Bridge</ENAMEX>, the controversial apartment <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Habitat</ENAMEX>, designed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israeli-born</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moshe Safdie</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Expo ‚</ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Äô67</NUMEX>, provides <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> with a grandstand view of the river and its islands. What looks to some like the aftermath of a child‚Äôs tantrum among its building blocks is on closer inspection an artful composition of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">354 precast</NUMEX> concrete boxes (originally hoisted into place by <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">crane</ENAMEX>) to create <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">158</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> of various sizes and combinations. To see the river from the river, take a harbor cruise from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quai</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Victoria</ENAMEX>, the northern most wharf in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vieux Montr√©al</ENAMEX>, at the foot of rue <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berri</ENAMEX>. 
For the more sporting breed, rafting expeditions also start out from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quai</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Victoria</ENAMEX> to shoot the famous <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lachine Rapids</ENAMEX>. You can also rent a bicycle for a pleasant ride along the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lachine Canal</ENAMEX>, dug in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1825</TIMEX> and deepened for the seaway in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1959</TIMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX>, it makes a great skating <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rink</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Museums</ENAMEX>
Among the most important of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montr√</ENAMEX>©al‚Äôs many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX> is its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum of Fine Arts</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mus√©e des Beaux Arts</ENAMEX>), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1380</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Sherbrooke Street</ENAMEX> West. It has an honorable collection of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Greco</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rubens</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hans Memling</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cranach</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Poussin</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">masters</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reynolds</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gainsborough, Raeburn, Romney</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hogarth</ENAMEX>. The moderns include <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Picasso and Giacometti</ENAMEX>.
But it‚Äôs worth devoting most of your time here to the excellent <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">galleries</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th-century</TIMEX> section, look for the imposing, if rather severe, classical portraits of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Antoine-S√©bastien Plamondon</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1802‚Äì1895</ENAMEX>) and the markedly gentler works of his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qu√</ENAMEX>©b√©cois <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">rival</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Th√©ophile Hamel</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1817‚Äì1870</ENAMEX>).
Mah-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Min</ENAMEX> or The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Feather</ENAMEX> is a dramatic study of an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Assiniboine Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manitoba</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Kane</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1810‚Äì1871</ENAMEX>). This <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Torontonian</ENAMEX> born in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">County Cork</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ireland</ENAMEX>, traveled all over the continent to gather a visual record, at times somewhat romanticized, of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canada‚Äôs native</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peoples</ENAMEX>. His contemporary, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX>-born <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cornelius Krieghoff</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1815‚Äì1872</ENAMEX>), concentrated on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qu√</ENAMEX>©bec peasantry and landscapes, as you can see here with his striking <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Montmorency Falls</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Winter</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">dazzling Village Street</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">West Indies</ENAMEX>, by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Montr√©al‚Äôs James Wilson Morrice</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1865‚Äì1924</ENAMEX>), is a fine work by this most celebrated of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canada‚Äôs</ENAMEX> expatriate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painters</ENAMEX>. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matisse</ENAMEX>, he worked principally in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North Africa</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Thomson</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group of Seven</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Emily Carr</ENAMEX> all have major works here. But of the moderns, the most significant represented is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul-Emile Borduas</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1905‚Äì1960</ENAMEX>). His <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Les</ENAMEX> signes s‚Äôenvolent and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L‚Äô√©toile</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">noire</ENAMEX> are stark, disturbing abstracts by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who began his career as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painter</ENAMEX> of church murals and stained glass. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rebelling</ENAMEX> against conservative religion under the dual influences of surrealism and psychoanalysis, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Borduas</ENAMEX> led the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qu√©bec Automatistes</ENAMEX>, represented here with outstanding works by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jean-Paul Riopelle</ENAMEX>, born in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1923</TIMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum of Contemporary Art</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mus√</ENAMEX>©e d‚ÄôArt <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Contemporain</ENAMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">185</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rue</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ste-Catherine</ENAMEX>, houses a stunning collection of works by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> and international <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX>. The small but tastefully designed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McCord Museum</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">690</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sherbrooke Street West</ENAMEX>) provides some fascinating insights into <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">life¬†‚Äî¬†Inuit</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> as well as the world of the fur <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pioneers</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 18th and 19th centuries</TIMEX>. Dominated by a totem pole from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">British Columbia</ENAMEX>, the exhibits include costumes, artifacts, paintings, drawings, and magnificent old photographs from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Notman</ENAMEX> archives (said to contain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45,000</NUMEX> prints and negatives).
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum of Decorative Arts</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mus√©e des</ENAMEX> arts <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">d√©coratifs</ENAMEX>) is housed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 20th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Ch√¢teau Dufresne</ENAMEX> (corner of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sherbrooke</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Boulevard Pie</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IX</NUMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2200</TIMEX> rue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crescent</ENAMEX>). More palazzo than ch√¢teau, with its frescoes and reinforced concrete columns clad in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Italian</TIMEX> marble, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> is devoted principally to international modern design in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ceramics</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glass</ENAMEX>, and textiles from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1940 to the present day</TIMEX>.
Train <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enthusiasts</ENAMEX> should head out to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canadian Railway Museum</ENAMEX> in the southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">suburb</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">St-Constant</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">122A rue</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">St-Pierre</ENAMEX>. Ride an old tram to the country <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX> where the sheds display historic train engines of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canadian Pacific</ENAMEX> and the luxury private <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coach</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Van Horne</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who master-minded the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C.P.R.‚Äôs</ENAMEX> transcontinental <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">railway</ENAMEX>. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sundays</TIMEX>, you can take a ride in one of the old steam <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trains</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eastern Townships</ENAMEX>
Stretching to the border with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vermont</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Hampshire</ENAMEX>, this pleasant region of farmland and orchards was settled at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the 18th century</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Loyalist refugees</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">American Revolution</ENAMEX>. There‚Äôs a distinctly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New England</ENAMEX> flavor to the architecture of white clapboard <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> in a landscape of rolling hills, green meadows, and lakes, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> overwhelmingly French-speaking. Tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> have tried to rename the area <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L‚ÄôEstrie</ENAMEX>, but even the most militant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qu√©b√©cois</ENAMEX> prefer the customary direct, if approximate, translation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cantons de l‚ÄôEst.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Motorway 10</TIMEX>, a tour of the region makes an easy day trip out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montr√©al</ENAMEX>, but you may well choose to stay longer for a restful boat cruise, picnic, or ramble, taking advantage of the many delightful old-fashioned country <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">inns</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> using the excellent local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">farm</ENAMEX> produce.
Popular with the sailing and windsurfing fraternity, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lake Brome</ENAMEX> and the sleepy <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Knowlton</ENAMEX> make a pleasant first stop. To see what the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX> are up to, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> over on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">mornings</TIMEX> to the market in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sutton</ENAMEX>. Take a leisurely boat cruise on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lake Memphremagog (‚ÄúBeautiful Waters‚Äù</ENAMEX>), the region‚Äôs largest, stretching across the border into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vermont</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">At St-Beno√Æt</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">du</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lac</ENAMEX>, look for the graceful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Neo-Gothic grey</ENAMEX>-stone silhouette of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Benedictine abbey</ENAMEX>, much appreciated for the monks‚Äô Gregorian chant. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monks</ENAMEX> also make and sell some fine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cheeses¬†‚Äî¬†an Italian-style ricotta</ENAMEX>, blue <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Ermite, and the Mont St-Beno√Æt</ENAMEX>, great with the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">apples</ENAMEX> they grow in their orchard.
Farther east, you‚Äôll find the most characteristic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New England</ENAMEX> atmosphere around <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lake Massawippi</ENAMEX>, particularly in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Hatley</ENAMEX>, where <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19th-century</TIMEX> colonial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansions</ENAMEX> have been converted into elegant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">inns</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> has some good <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">antiques shops</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Piggery</ENAMEX> provides a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> for one of the region‚Äôs last surviving English-language <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">theaters</ENAMEX>. Thanks to its situation in a sheltered valley, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">North Hatley</ENAMEX> enjoys a particularly pleasant <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">microclimate</ENAMEX> that attracts hummingbirds and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flora</ENAMEX> indicative of more southern climes.
At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coaticook</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hikers</ENAMEX> and picnickers <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> for the wooded ravines along the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Coaticook River</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> stages a milk festival with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cows</ENAMEX> (and some of the milkmaids) dressed in fancy <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> bonnets. The great attraction at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cookshire</ENAMEX> is the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bread</ENAMEX> festival.
The Laurentians
The densely forested, rolling mountain range that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qu√</ENAMEX>©b√©cois call les Laurentides constitutes a favorite <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> and winter <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">playground</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montr√©al.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Swimming</ENAMEX>, sailing, canoeing, waterskiing, fishing, hiking, horseback-riding, golf¬†‚Äî¬†the list of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> pleasures is endless. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX>, the skating and skiing, downhill and cross-country, are the best in eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>. And the landscape is a pure joy, with long, narrow glacial lakes fed by cold streams gurgling down the granite mountain <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">slopes</ENAMEX> of yellow birch, beech, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sugar maple</ENAMEX>, and fir.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">virgin forests</ENAMEX> were long a refuge for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algonquin Indians</ENAMEX> fleeing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iroquois</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qu√©b√©cois</ENAMEX> began to settle here in any great numbers only in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the second half of the 19th century</TIMEX>, when an enterprising curate, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Antoine Labelle</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">St-J√©r√¥me</ENAMEX>, promoted it as an alternative for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peasants</ENAMEX> who were otherwise immigrating to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New England</ENAMEX>. This southeastern edge of the great <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> Shield proved poor farm <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> and difficult to exploit for logging, but it really came into its own in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 20th century</TIMEX> with the development of tourism. In addition to local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montr√©alers</ENAMEX>, it attracts steady traffic from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New England</ENAMEX>.
The heart of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> area is within an easy <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">90-minute to 2-hour</TIMEX> drive from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a weekend</TIMEX> or longer stay. Motorway <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> northwest from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montr√©al</ENAMEX>, then <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Highway 117</ENAMEX> take you into forested foothills immediately beyond the metropolis.
Just <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">70 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">42 miles</NUMEX>) from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">St-Sauveur</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">des-Monts</ENAMEX> makes a charming spot to stop for lunch on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the roadside <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">flowered</ENAMEX> terraces. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> is popular for its floodlit nightskiing. Ste-Ad√®le on the shores of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lac Rond</ENAMEX> is a favorite with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painters</ENAMEX> and their groupies. The town‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Village de S√</ENAMEX>©raphin recaptures the atmosphere of life in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Laurentians</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1880s</TIMEX>.
Probably the liveliest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> in the area is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ste-Agathe-des-Monts</ENAMEX>. It boasts plenty of good <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">folksong bars</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">bo√Ætes √† chansons</ENAMEX>), and a famous <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> theater, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Le Patriote</ENAMEX>. Night owls overcome their hangover with a stroll or boat cruise around the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lac des Sables</ENAMEX>. 
The full natural beauty of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Laurentians</ENAMEX> is best appreciated in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mont</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Tremblant</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Provincial Park</ENAMEX>. Rent a canoe or kayak to explore some of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> lakes and rivers that sparkle across an area of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,500 sq. km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">579 square miles</NUMEX>). It was the rush of those streams that inspired the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algonquin</ENAMEX> name <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Manitonga Sontana</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mountain</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Trembling Spirit</ENAMEX>, emitting its muffled boom when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> disturbed its peace. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mont-Tremblant‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,058-m</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,175</NUMEX>-ft) Johannsen peak is the highest in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Laurentians</ENAMEX>. At the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">St-Donat</ENAMEX> reception <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> or other entry points to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>, you‚Äôll find detailed maps of self-guiding nature <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">trails</ENAMEX> with signposts describing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">forest‚Äôs flora</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">fauna</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> also provides forest guides for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> tours. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">park‚Äôs wildlife</ENAMEX>, even more abundant in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rouge-Matawin Nature Reserve</ENAMEX> to the north, includes moose, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">deer</ENAMEX>, black <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bear</ENAMEX>, otter, mink, muskrat, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fox</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">beaver</ENAMEX>. Birdwatchers may spot grouse, loon, heron, finches, and warblers, while anglers can hope to catch speckled and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">lake trout</ENAMEX>, pike, bass, and walleye.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Qu√©bec City</ENAMEX>
Whereas <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montr√©al</ENAMEX> has become increasingly ‚ÄúAmericanized,‚Äù the provincial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> remains unmistakably, even defiantly <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Qu√©b√©cois</ENAMEX>, if not downright ‚ÄúFrench.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äù It‚</ENAMEX>Äôs difficult to miss, in this proud cradle of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New France</ENAMEX>, that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> is borrowing a leaf from the book of the modern <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">republic</ENAMEX> by calling its provincial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parliament</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Assembl√©e Nationale</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only one</NUMEX> percent of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">664,000</NUMEX> do not speak <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">French</ENAMEX>. 
The historic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> has something of the atmosphere of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France‚Äôs Atlantic</ENAMEX> port <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> in the neighborhood down by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Lawrence River</ENAMEX>, while the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> and squares up on the promontory offer <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">North Americans</ENAMEX> a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> hint of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Paris‚Äôs Latin Quarter</ENAMEX> or even <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Montmartre</ENAMEX>. Certainly it‚Äôs a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> for that most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parisian</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">creatures</ENAMEX>, the fl√¢neur, or stroller, wandering at leisure through narrow back <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>, paying due homage to the monuments of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Qu√©bec City‚Äôs</ENAMEX> past triumphs and tribulations, but even more alert to the colors and smells of the living present.
Qu√©bec is said to be derived from an <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Algonquin</ENAMEX> word meaning ‚Äúwhere the river narrows,‚Äù and this becomes most apparent when you see the city‚Äôs great outcrop of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rock</ENAMEX>, jutting out over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Lawrence</ENAMEX>. It was named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cap Diamant</ENAMEX>, after the shiny <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stones</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacques Cartier</ENAMEX> mistook for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diamonds</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>). Thus, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> dominated river traffic and prospered from a flourishing trade in fur, lumber, shipbuilding, tanneries, furniture, and textiles. Modern shipping and the advent of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">railways</ENAMEX> crippled its port activities, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> now lives from the service industries of tourism and provincial government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>.
For the best view of the city‚Äôs spectacular location, cross over to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Lawrence River‚</ENAMEX>Äôs south <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX> and take the ferry (traversier) from the suburb of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L√©vis.</ENAMEX> Otherwise <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> through the airy but unexceptional modern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> to the historic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Old Qu√©bec</ENAMEX>, where the fortified <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Upper</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lower</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Town</ENAMEX> stand at the top and bottom of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cap Diamant</ENAMEX>, linked by a steep road and funicular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">railway</ENAMEX>. Apart from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Citadel</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Battlefields Park</ENAMEX>, every sight worth seeing is within easy walking distance, though you may like to try a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">45-minute</TIMEX> ride in a horse-drawn cal√®che (from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parc de l‚ÄôEsplanade</ENAMEX>).
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Upper Town</ENAMEX>
Start on top of the rock, where the city‚Äôs principal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">landmark</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ch√¢teau Frontenac</ENAMEX>, looming over the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1892</TIMEX> like the protective fortress it no longer needs. Because of its dramatic location and the fairytale turrets of its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gothic-Renaissance</ENAMEX> architecture, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Frontenac</ENAMEX> is one of the most charmingly bombastic of all the many grand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canadian Pacific</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canadian National railways</ENAMEX> put up across the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> as symbols of their commercial power. It is named after Count <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis de Frontenac</ENAMEX>, a rascally <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX> who upset the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clergy</ENAMEX> by encouraging the sale of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">brandy</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">native</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peoples</ENAMEX>. Take a look inside at the stucco <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">carvings</ENAMEX>, tapestries, and handsome wood paneling.
Behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX>, beyond an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1898</TIMEX> statue of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samuel de Champlain</ENAMEX>, the city‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Dufferin Terrace</ENAMEX> offers a magnificent view over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Lawrence</ENAMEX> and downriver to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ile d‚ÄôOrl√©ans</ENAMEX>. Stroll alongside a pleasant little garden, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parc des Gouverneurs</ENAMEX>, with its obelisk paying tribute to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Generals Wolfe</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Montcalm</ENAMEX>, both killed at the great battle for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qu√</ENAMEX>©bec in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1759</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terrace</ENAMEX> is prolonged by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Promenade des Gouverneurs</ENAMEX>, continuing the walk along the foot of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">citadel towards Battlefields Park</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North of the Frontenac</ENAMEX>, Place d‚ÄôArmes is the center of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Old Qu√©bec</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> were mustered and paraded, proclamations read out, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">criminals</ENAMEX> whipped or executed. In the middle, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monument</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Faith</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monument de la Foi</ENAMEX>) commemorates the work of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French Catholic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">missionaries</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North America</ENAMEX>. On the north side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mus√©e du Fort</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rue</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ste-Anne</ENAMEX>, stages a sound and light show alternately in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> on the military history of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Qu√©bec City</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Artists</ENAMEX> gather in the narrow rue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">du Tr√</ENAMEX>©sor at the northwest corner of the Place d‚ÄôArmes to display their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">works</ENAMEX> or paint your portrait. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> leads into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">city‚Äôs ‚ÄúLatin Quarter</ENAMEX>,‚Äù with a quite <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parisian</ENAMEX> air to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 18th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>, caf√©s, and bookshops around rue <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Couillard</ENAMEX>, rue <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">St-Flavien</ENAMEX>, and rue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H√©bert.</ENAMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">neighborhood‚Äôs ‚ÄúLatin‚Äù</ENAMEX> derives from the scholarship of a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Seminary</ENAMEX>, rue de l‚ÄôUniversit√©, founded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1663</TIMEX> by the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bishop</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qu√©bec</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fran√ßois de Montmorency Laval</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX>, open-air concerts are held in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX>. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mus√©e du S√©minaire</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> rue de l‚ÄôUniversite, you‚Äôll find a portrait of the crusty old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bishop</ENAMEX> painted in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1672</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brother Luc</ENAMEX>, as well as landscapes by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph L√©gar√©</ENAMEX> and self-portraits by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Antoine Plamondon</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Th√©ophile Hamel</ENAMEX>.
Set back behind tall <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> off the rue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">des Jardins</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglican Holy Trinity Cathedral</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1804</TIMEX>, with its elegant <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">spire</ENAMEX>, will be familiar to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Londoners</ENAMEX> for its respectful imitation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Martin</ENAMEX>-in-the-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fields</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Notice</ENAMEX> inside the solid old pews of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">oak</ENAMEX>.
In an attractive garden setting, the large <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ursuline Convent</ENAMEX> was established in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1639</TIMEX> and rebuilt twice after fire. Its chapel has a fine <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th-century</TIMEX> altar painting and pulpit. Montcalm was buried here after the battle, but only his skull remains, in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> otherwise devoted to the convent‚Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother superior</ENAMEX>, who compiled the first dictionary of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iroquois</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algonquin</ENAMEX> languages. The pasture for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">convent‚Äôs cattle</ENAMEX> is now the quiet, spacious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parc de l‚ÄôEsplanade</ENAMEX>, the perfect place to rest your tired sightseeing feet.
Lower <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Town</ENAMEX>
Various stairways and the winding <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C√¥te de la Montagne</ENAMEX> take you down past <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Montmorency Park</ENAMEX> to the site of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Champlain‚</ENAMEX>Äôs original <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX>, which grew into the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ville Basse</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lower</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Town</ENAMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the more hazardous ways down, and so a favorite with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Escalier Casse-Cou</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Breakneck Stairway</ENAMEX>), merely dangerous when wet, lethal when icy. For the view, take the funicular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">railway</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Dufferin Terrace</ENAMEX>. The funicular‚Äôs Lower <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Town</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terminal</ENAMEX> was once the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis Joliet</ENAMEX>, great <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17th-century</TIMEX> fur <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader</ENAMEX> and explorer of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mississippi River</ENAMEX>.

In the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> is a replica of a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1686</TIMEX> bust of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Louis XIV</ENAMEX>. Facing the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Place Royale</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Notre-Dame-des-Victoires</ENAMEX> celebrates <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> victories over the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1759</TIMEX>.
After centuries of devastation by war, fire, plunder, and sheer neglect, the meticulous restoration work by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Qu√©bec</ENAMEX> provincial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> has been a major act of faith in the cultural legacy of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New France</ENAMEX>, reinforcing the provincial motto ‚ÄúJe me souviens.‚Äù After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1759</TIMEX>, most colonial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">administrators</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">merchants</ENAMEX> just abandoned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qu√©bec</ENAMEX>, while many who stayed on moved to the shelter of the new <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">defenses</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Upper</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Town</ENAMEX>. During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 20th centuries</TIMEX>, older <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> were often arbitrarily razed to make way for waterfront <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">warehouses</ENAMEX> and workshops.
Among the historic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> on rue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">du March√©-Champlain, Maison Chevalier</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1752</TIMEX>) has become a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> of old <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Qu√©b√©cois</ENAMEX> furniture and domestic utensils. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maison Dumont</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1689</TIMEX>) on <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Place Royale</ENAMEX> is now the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maison des Vins</ENAMEX>, selling good <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> and owned, like all <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Qu√©b√©cois wine</ENAMEX> and alcohol <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">retailers</ENAMEX>, by the provincial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>. On the corner of the ruelle <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">du Porche</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maison Milot</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1691</TIMEX>) is notable for its sturdy roof beams.
The quaintest of the city‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">antiques shops</ENAMEX> have clustered around rue <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sault</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">au-Matelot</ENAMEX> and rue <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">St-Paul</ENAMEX> down by the port. The bargains here are old tools and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen utensils</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> has renovated the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">warehouses</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Old Port</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vieux Port</ENAMEX>) as an entertainment area with concerts, open-air <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">theater</ENAMEX>, a craftware market, and a couple of handsome old sailing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX>.
Beyond the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">City Wall</ENAMEX>
From the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parc de l‚ÄôEsplanade</ENAMEX>, drive up the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C√¥te de la Citadelle</ENAMEX> hill road and through a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tunnel</ENAMEX> for a guided tour around a powerful bastion of fears long gone. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> built the starshaped <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Citadel</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1750</TIMEX> to resist the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> enlarged it in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1820</TIMEX> to defend <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Qu√©bec City</ENAMEX> against the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>, but their cannons never fired a shot in anger. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garrison</ENAMEX> was <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX>-manned for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">only 20 years</TIMEX> before being handed over to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">troops</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> it is the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">home</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canada‚</ENAMEX>Äôs crack <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal 22nd Regiment</ENAMEX>.
In summertime the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garrison</ENAMEX> comes to life with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Changing of the Guard</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">10am</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 24‚Äìfirst week</TIMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sept.</TIMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Beating the Retreat</ENAMEX> (6pm <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wed‚</ENAMEX>ÄìSat during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August</TIMEX>). The old <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">powder</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX> serves now as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mus√©e Militaire</ENAMEX>, displaying the regiment‚Äôs history with its trophies, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX>, and uniforms.
Running southwest from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parc de l‚ÄôEsplanade</ENAMEX>, the broad, modern <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Grande-All√©e</ENAMEX> runs past the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Assembl√©e Nationale</ENAMEX> (provincial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parliament</ENAMEX>), built from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1877‚Äì1886</NUMEX> in the favored style of the time, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">French Renaissance</ENAMEX>. This has been the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">citadel of Qu√</ENAMEX>©bec‚Äôs quest for a special identity in or outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canadian Confederation</ENAMEX>, especially under <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prime Minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ren√</ENAMEX>© <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L√©vesque.</ENAMEX>
On <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Boulevard St-Cyrille</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Grand Th√©√¢tre de Qu√©bec</ENAMEX> was inaugurated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1971</TIMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Qu√©bec City‚</ENAMEX>Äôs arts <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> and home of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qu√©bec Symphony Orchestra</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Battlefields Park</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parc des Champs de Bataille</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">390</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rue</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Bernieres</ENAMEX>) is devoted to the momentous battle on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Plains</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abraham</ENAMEX> that decided the fate of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qu√</ENAMEX>©bec in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1759</TIMEX>. Quite apart from its historical significance, the park offers delightful walks across the treelined fields. In the center of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> you‚Äôll see a massive Martello <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX>, built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1805</TIMEX>, as part of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qu√</ENAMEX>©bec‚Äôs new defenses against a potential <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> attack. In a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> where every monument seems like a political statement, rue <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolfe</ENAMEX> leads to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> on the spot where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Wolfe</ENAMEX> was mortally wounded, while anonymous <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Qu√©b√©cois patriots</ENAMEX> have responded with a statue of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joan</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Arc</ENAMEX>, off the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avenue George VI</ENAMEX>.
In the southern <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mus√©e de Qu√©bec</ENAMEX> possesses a first-rate collection of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Qu√©b√©cois</ENAMEX> painting and sculpture, as well as historic furniture, jewelry, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX> and silver church ornaments. The sculpture is principally from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 18th century</TIMEX>, but the paintings range from the colony‚Äôs beginnings to the present day. Look for the historical studies of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph L√©gar√©</ENAMEX>, the portraits of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Antoine Plamondon</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Th√©odore Hamel</ENAMEX>, and landscapes of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cornelius Krieghoff</ENAMEX>. Among the moderns are the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Automatiste</ENAMEX> abstracts of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jean-Paul Riopelle</ENAMEX> and the optical art of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacques Hurtubise</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C√¥te de Charlevoix</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A day</TIMEX> trip along the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Lawrence River</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Highway 360</ENAMEX> north of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Qu√©bec City</ENAMEX> will give you a glimpse of village life and the challenging landscape in which the habitants created their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">farms</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C√¥te de Charlevoix</ENAMEX> is part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Laurentian</ENAMEX> heights, reaching to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Saguenay River</ENAMEX> where the coureurs de bois turned off in search of furs.
At the northern edge of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, turn right after the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Montmorency River</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX> into a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> where a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terrace</ENAMEX> overlooks the impressive <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Montmorency Falls</ENAMEX>, plunging <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">91 m</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">274 ft</ENAMEX>) into the river.
Ste-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anne-de-Beaupr√</ENAMEX>© is a major pilgrimage <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> for torch-lit processions in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> to the glory of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> of the Virgin <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary</ENAMEX>. Beyond the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, in a sudden confrontation with the wilderness, a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">walkway</ENAMEX> in the forest takes you up close to the pounding waters of the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">80-m</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">240-ft</ENAMEX>) Ste-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anne Falls</ENAMEX>, ragged and crashing around the boulders, a much less neat and tidy cascade than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montmorency</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Painters</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">craftsmen</ENAMEX> who have made their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> in the fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baie-St-Paul</ENAMEX> will be more than happy to sell you their work.
In a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> boasting one of the world‚Äôs biggest paper <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">industries</ENAMEX>, you‚Äôll find here <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> last <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">St-Joseph-de-la-Rive</ENAMEX>, where you can buy handmade paper, perfect for writing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> with distinction. On the wharf, take a ferry across to the lovely little <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Ile</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aux</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Coudres</ENAMEX>, another fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX> that has become a favorite artists‚Äô haunt. The island‚Äôs homecrafts include weaving the rough <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Qu√©b√©cois rag rugs</ENAMEX> known as catalognes. You may be tempted into an overnight stay by the colorful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">inns</ENAMEX> and folksong taverns run by retired <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">seamen</ENAMEX>, who look as if they escaped the old schooner stranded at the southwest end of the island. These salts do cook up a fine heart-warming fish <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">soup</ENAMEX>. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacques Cartier</ENAMEX> got to the island, his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sailors</ENAMEX> made a feast of the hazelnuts, for which coudres is an old <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">French</ENAMEX> word.
Ever since <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William H. Taft</ENAMEX> built himself a holiday home out at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Pointe-au-Pic</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the beginning of the century</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Malbaie</ENAMEX> has enjoyed a reputation as the region‚Äôs smartest resort <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, offering horseback-riding, golf, and tennis. Stop at the grand old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manoir Richelieu</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX> at least for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">superbly manicured lawns</ENAMEX> overlooking the river. 
Gasp√© <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Peninsula</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gasp√©</ENAMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">landfall</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacques Cartier</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1534</TIMEX>, is a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Micmac Indian</ENAMEX> word for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Land‚Äôs End</ENAMEX>, and this is indeed southern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Qu√©bec‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most remote region, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">700 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">420 miles</NUMEX>) from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Qu√©bec City</ENAMEX>. But it‚Äôs well worth the trip for anyone with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four or five days</TIMEX> to spare and eager to get away from the throng into this still-unspoiled wilderness on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gulf of St. Lawrence</ENAMEX>.
Densely wooded <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">river valleys</ENAMEX> and sheltered coves break up the rugged <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">north coast</ENAMEX>, with its steep cliffs plunging down to broad pebble or fine sandy beaches. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chics-Chocs Mountains</ENAMEX> of the interior, the highest in eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>, are the northern <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">‚Äúterminal‚Äù of the Appalachian Range</ENAMEX> that begins down in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alabama</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Descendants</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acadians</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Loyalists</ENAMEX>, the warm and friendly <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Gaspesians</ENAMEX> are a more harmonious mix of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>- and English-speaking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> than elsewhere in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qu√©bec.</ENAMEX> In a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> without any noteworthy industry other than cod fishing, a little forestry, and tourism, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> add to their income by selling their craftwork and farm produce from improvised stands. 
At the tip of the peninsula, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Forillon National Park</ENAMEX> offers great <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> for fishing, boat cruises, skin-diving (wetsuits are obligatory), and hiking. In this most spectacular of land- and seascapes, even the least artistic of you will be tempted to take up painting or at least photography. Look out for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">whales</ENAMEX> and grey seals in the gulf. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Wildlife</ENAMEX> inside the park includes fat little porcupine, hare, red squirrel, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">deer</ENAMEX>, moose and an occasional bear, lynx, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fox</ENAMEX>. Birdwatchers have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> to feast their eyes on, with guillemots and cormorants among the easier to spot. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gasp√</ENAMEX>© makes its livelihood from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">fishing¬†‚Äî¬†cod</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">herring</ENAMEX>. It offers good opportunities for sailing and windsurfing (again, wetsuits obligatory). On the rue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">du Monument</ENAMEX> is a granite cross commemorating the wooden cross that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacques Cartier</ENAMEX> planted on behalf of his <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> sovereign in front of a bemused <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iroquois</ENAMEX>.
The best <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> are in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">resort town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Perc√©</ENAMEX>, so this is naturally the most crowded place on the peninsula. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> come for watersports and to marvel at the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cliffs pierced</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">perc√©</ENAMEX>) by the sea. Erosion originally created <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> arches in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">94</NUMEX>-m- (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">82-ft-</NUMEX>) high rocks, but one has since crumbled. See them at sunrise when they‚Äôre pink. Take a cruise around <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Bonaventure Island</ENAMEX> to view the penguins and puffins.
THE <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATLANTIC</ENAMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX> coastal <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">provinces</ENAMEX> lie off Canada‚Äôs beaten track. This implies many advantages for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> seeking lovely unspoiled countryside away from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowds</ENAMEX>, but also, for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX>, some acute political and economic disadvantages. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nova Scotia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prince</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward Island</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">P.E.I.</ENAMEX>), and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Brunswick</ENAMEX> make up the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maritime Provinces</ENAMEX>, more commonly known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maritimes</ENAMEX>. Last to join the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canadian Confederation</ENAMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1949</TIMEX>, the offshore <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newfoundland</ENAMEX> is linked as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX> with the mainland region of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Labrador</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maritimes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Newfoundland</ENAMEX>, together now known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Atlantic Provinces</ENAMEX>, have often felt neglected. They were the last <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">provinces</ENAMEX> to benefit from transcontinental <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">railways</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">highways</ENAMEX>. New Brunswick‚Äôs shipbuilding timber suffered in the age of steam and steel hulls. Newfoundland‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">fisheries</ENAMEX> were equally hard hit when modern refrigeration made it possible for foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> to dispense with the island‚Äôs centuries-old drying techniques. Economic hardship prompted some to migrate to other regions.
But this separateness has shaped a hardy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of considerable character and charm. Just getting to know them makes the journey worthwhile. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">You‚Äôll</ENAMEX> find them cheerful, friendly, and more easily approachable than the big-city <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folk</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ontario</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qu√©bec.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newfoundland</ENAMEX> is peopled almost exclusively from the southwest of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX> and southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ireland</ENAMEX>, whence the special music and color of their dialect (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">145</NUMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maritimes</ENAMEX> have been mainly settled by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scottish Highlanders</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Protestants</ENAMEX>, and French-speaking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acadians</ENAMEX>.
The cooler climate makes the region a strictly <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> and early <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">autumn</TIMEX> destination. It‚Äôs a land of hiking, camping, and fishing, with some good swimming off <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prince</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward Island</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nova Scotia</ENAMEX>. If the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maritimes</ENAMEX> are warm to mellow from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late June</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early September</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newfoundland</ENAMEX> is a little fresher.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nova Scotia</ENAMEX>
You‚Äôd think the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chamber of commerce</ENAMEX> carved their map as a public relations gimmick, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX> really is shaped like a lobster. In any case, many a gourmet or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">glutton</ENAMEX> feels that a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Halifax</ENAMEX> lobster dinner is reason enough to make the trip. But weight <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">watchers</ENAMEX> can enjoy <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nova Scotia</ENAMEX>, too.
There‚Äôs the sparkling <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX> coastline, with its delightful little fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ports</ENAMEX>. Or rolling green hills across the interior to the orchards and dairy <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">farms</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Annapolis Valley</ENAMEX>. This western <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">side</ENAMEX> of the peninsula is rich in the poignant history of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">French Acadia</ENAMEX>. The province‚Äôs northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> is the site of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canada‚</ENAMEX>Äôs best-loved national <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cape Breton Highlands</ENAMEX>, where <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">you‚Äôll</NUMEX> drive the spectacular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Cabot Trail</ENAMEX> along the coast and in and out of the forest.
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Halifax</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ships</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> navy jostle with the trawlers of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nova Scotia‚</ENAMEX>Äôs commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">fisheries</ENAMEX> in this major <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port</ENAMEX>. But the prevailing tone is one of more relaxed pleasure, typified by the yachts and sailboats gliding gracefully in and out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest Arm</ENAMEX> marinas.
Attracted by the natural harbor, one of the world‚Äôs largest, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> established the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-18th century</TIMEX> as a naval <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garrison</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shipyard</ENAMEX> to counter the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> fortress of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Louisbourg</ENAMEX> farther north on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cape Breton</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">130</NUMEX>). Halifax‚Äôs strategic position on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX> soon proved even more invaluable as a base for ‚Äúfarming‚Äù the rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shoals</ENAMEX> of cod and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">herring</ENAMEX> on the ocean‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scotian Shelf</ENAMEX>. In this haven for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pirates</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rum-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">runners</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samuel Cunard</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1787‚Äì1865</ENAMEX>) founded his famous transatlantic shipping line with a fortune acquired in large part from privateering.
Down on the harborfront <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, the old wharves, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">warehouses</ENAMEX>, even the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> of joyous ill-repute that cluster in back <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> around any international <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port</ENAMEX> have been refurbished as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Historic Properties</ENAMEX>, a bright and breezy neighborhood of artists‚Äô <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">studios</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">galleries</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, and taverns with open-air terraces. The boardwalk takes you through a colorful architecture of red brick, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">timber</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">grey stone</ENAMEX>, and gaily painted clapboard. Summer attractions include a puppet theater, concerts, lobster races, and windsurfing competitions. At the international tournament of town <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">criers</ENAMEX>, hear local newsmongers in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th-century</TIMEX> costume pitting their Oyez! against the best bellowers from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bermuda</ENAMEX>.
Anchored by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Privateers‚Äô Warehouse</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Halifax</ENAMEX> was a popular haven for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pirates</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Napoleonic Wars</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rum</ENAMEX>-running <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Prohibition</ENAMEX> Era of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1920s</TIMEX>) is a grand racing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">schooner</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Bluenose</ENAMEX> II. You can walk the decks or even take a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two-hour</TIMEX> cruise on this replica of the famous <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1921</TIMEX> champion sailship portrayed on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> ten<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">-cent</NUMEX> coin. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúBluenose‚Äù</ENAMEX> was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Americans‚</ENAMEX>Äô nickname for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nova Scotia‚</ENAMEX>Äôs wind-whipped <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sailors</ENAMEX>. If the schooner is out of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX> on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of its frequent goodwill tours down the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">coast</ENAMEX>, there are several other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">harbor</ENAMEX> cruises well worth taking, to view the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shipyards</ENAMEX>, naval installations, and fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">fleet</ENAMEX>, as well as the yacht <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clubs</ENAMEX> and elegant waterfront <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Northwest Arm inlet</ENAMEX>.
Also on the harbor, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maritime Museum of the Atlantic</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1675</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lower Water Street</ENAMEX>,) is housed in a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">turn-of-the-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ship</ENAMEX> chandlery, setting the tone with a nostalgic whiff of tarred rope in the restored shop on the ground floor. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> traces the dockyards‚Äô <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">200-year</TIMEX> history, displaying naval instruments, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX>, and some superb <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ship models</ENAMEX> from sail to steam, including the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aquitania</ENAMEX> ocean <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">liner</ENAMEX>. A special section is devoted to shipwrecks on the notorious <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Sable Island</ENAMEX>. Berthed at the museum‚Äôs wharf is the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1913</TIMEX> survey vessel, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acadia</ENAMEX>, that charted the coasts of eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nova Scotia</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hudson Bay</ENAMEX>.
Downtown, on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hollis Street</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Province</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX>, a dignified <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Georgian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stone</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1819</TIMEX>), boasts <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canada‚</ENAMEX>Äôs oldest legislative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX>, instigated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New England Loyalists</ENAMEX>. A statue of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Howe</ENAMEX> stands in front; he was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nova Scotia‚Äôs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">champion</ENAMEX> of a free <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">press</ENAMEX> and democratic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>, but a fierce <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponent</ENAMEX> of joining the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Confederation</ENAMEX>.
For a good panoramic view of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Halifax</ENAMEX> and a sense of its important military history, make your way around the grassy slopes leading to the star-shaped <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Citadel</ENAMEX>, from which a cannon-shot has boomed across the town <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each day</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">noon</TIMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1850s</TIMEX>. A good guided tour takes you around the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garrison</ENAMEX>, originally built for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX>. It is surrounded by a deep, wide, dry <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">moat</ENAMEX>, thick walls, and fortified grass-covered earthworks. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Cavalier Building</ENAMEX> has been restored to the way it was in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1869</TIMEX> and is now an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Army Museum</ENAMEX> with uniforms, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX>, and the models of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> previous city <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fortresses</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South Magazine</ENAMEX> stored powder barrels <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">uncomfortably</ENAMEX> close to military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prisoners</ENAMEX> who were kept, with the cannons, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Garrison Cells</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> used the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Citadel</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">barracks</ENAMEX> in both world wars, while anti-aircraft batteries were installed there in <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War</ENAMEX> II. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> in the kilted uniform of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">78th</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Highlanders</ENAMEX> perform infantry and artillery drills. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nova Scotia Tattoo</ENAMEX> stages more spectacular military bagpipe parades, highland dances, singing, and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Naval Gun</ENAMEX> Run competition at the nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Halifax Metro Center</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late June</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early July</TIMEX>.
From the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Citadel</ENAMEX>, looking east, you can see the city‚Äôs popular landmark, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Old Town Clock</ENAMEX>. This octagonal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> was erected in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1803</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prince</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward</ENAMEX>, tough <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commander</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nova Scotia</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> and future <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Queen</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Victoria</ENAMEX>. At the south end of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grand Parade</ENAMEX>, opposite the city <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX>, stands <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. Paul‚Äôs</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1750</TIMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canada‚</ENAMEX>Äôs oldest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>.
West of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Citadel</ENAMEX>, on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Summer Street</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nova Scotia</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum of Natural History</ENAMEX> is devoted to the province‚Äôs human and natural history. It exhibits <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> clothing, tools, and artifacts, with local <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Micmac Indians</ENAMEX> demonstrating their use, and colonial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ceramics</ENAMEX>, glassware, and pinewood furniture (often artfully painted to imitate more expensive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mahogany</ENAMEX> or oak). Regional wildlife on display ranges from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dinosaurs</ENAMEX> to moose, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bear</ENAMEX>, coyotes, and bald eagles. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Halifax Public Gardens</ENAMEX>, south of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>, makes a pleasant stroll around the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">duck pond</ENAMEX> and among such exquisite <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> as the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gingko</ENAMEX> and white-flowered <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dove</ENAMEX> tree, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> lilac and larch, and a corkscrew birch. Try to be here for an utterly <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Victorian</ENAMEX> open-air <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> concert.
The town‚Äôs most attractive piece of greenery is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Point Pleasant Park</ENAMEX>, whose beach and shady woods make it ideal for picnics. At the southern tip of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Halifax</ENAMEX> peninsula, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> provides a fine vantage point from which to watch the big <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX> in the harbor and the yachts on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Northwest Arm</ENAMEX>. Among old ruined fortifications is the still intact <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prince</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Wales Martello Tower</ENAMEX>, a massive stone <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> serving as <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">barracks</ENAMEX>, weapons storage, and artillery <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platform</ENAMEX>, built by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prince</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1796</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Collectors</ENAMEX> of lore about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Titanic</ENAMEX> ocean <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">liner</ENAMEX>, which sank south of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newfoundland</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1912</TIMEX>, can find the tombs of many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Fairview Cemetery</ENAMEX> on the northwest side of town.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Atlantic Coast</ENAMEX>
Scores of lighthouses along <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nova Scotia‚</ENAMEX>Äôs south shore trace a sawtoothed route of coves that over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the ages</TIMEX> offered shelter to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pirates</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rum-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">runners</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fishermen</ENAMEX>. For the modern holidaymaker, there are plenty of pleasant bathing beaches, too.
The <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">45-minute</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">48-km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">30-mile</NUMEX>) drive along winding coastal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Highway 333</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Halifax</ENAMEX> southwest to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peggy‚Äôs Cove</ENAMEX> has become a photographer‚Äôs pilgrimage. This almost unbearably picturesque fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village perches</ENAMEX> its brightly colored clapboard <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cottages</ENAMEX> and lighthouse among massive granite <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">boulders</ENAMEX>. The trick is to keep the snack<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-bars</ENAMEX> and souvenir <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> out of the picture.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">You‚Äôll</ENAMEX> find more deserted coves and beaches around <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">St. Margaret‚Äôs Bay</ENAMEX> as you drive on to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chester</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">79 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">49 miles</NUMEX>) west of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peggy‚Äôs Cove</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mahone Bay</ENAMEX>. This fashionable resort <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> was founded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1759</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Massachusetts</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fishermen</ENAMEX> and remains a favorite vacation spot for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Englanders</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inland</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20 minutes‚Äô</NUMEX> drive from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chester</ENAMEX> north along <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Highway 12</ENAMEX>, you can visit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ross Farm</ENAMEX>, a living <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> of 300 years of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nova Scotia</ENAMEX> farming. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxcarts</ENAMEX> and horse-drawn haywagons take you around the property, where you can watch barrel-making, see the old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">farm</ENAMEX> implements in action, and buy produce from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">farm kitchen</ENAMEX> and locally made craftware. Take a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> trip from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mahone Bay</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oak Island</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dreamers</ENAMEX> still dig for the gold doubloons, emeralds, rubies, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diamonds</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Captain William Kidd</ENAMEX>, lovable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">villain</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Louis Stevenson‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Treasure Island</ENAMEX>, is said to have buried here. This real-life <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Scots</ENAMEX>-born <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">brigand</ENAMEX> received the official <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blessing</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> to plunder <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madagascar</ENAMEX>, frequently hiding out on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nova Scotia</ENAMEX> coast. That blessing didn‚Äôt keep him from being hanged in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX>, convicted of murder and acts of piracy.
Down the coast from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mahone Bay</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lunenburg</ENAMEX>, the original <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th-century</TIMEX> settlement of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Protestants</ENAMEX>, is an attractive <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of grey-weathered shingleboard <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>. Its proud boast in modern times is the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> of the original <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bluenose</ENAMEX> racing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">schooner</ENAMEX>. On the waterfront, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fisheries Museum of the Atlantic</ENAMEX> will give you a vivid sense of the whole history of sailing and fishing along <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nova Scotia‚Äôs</ENAMEX> coasts. Besides a beautiful model of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bluenose</ENAMEX>, the museum‚Äôs star attractions are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> old <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX> moored in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port</ENAMEX>: the schooner <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Theresa E. Connor</ENAMEX> used for cod fishing and the trawler <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cape Sable</ENAMEX>. Across <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lunenburg Harbor</ENAMEX>, take a clifftop hike through the little pine forest and around the striking rock formations of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Ovens</ENAMEX>. These deep caves were the scene of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mini</ENAMEX> gold rush in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1861</TIMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Englanders</ENAMEX> poured into the area to pan a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">few¬†‚Äî¬†very few¬†‚Äî¬†nuggets</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">shale</ENAMEX> on the beach. A little <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> shows you their tools, techniques, and a few molar-sized bits of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Annapolis Valley</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Route 101</ENAMEX> takes you from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Halifax</ENAMEX> northwest across the peninsula through <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Annapolis Valley‚</ENAMEX>Äôs fertile farmland of apple orchards, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">strawberry</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">fields</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cattle</ENAMEX> pastures. This is the heart of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nova Scotia‚Äôs French Acadia</ENAMEX>.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Windsor</ENAMEX>, stop off to see <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 18th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">blockhouse</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fort Edward</ENAMEX> (named after <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Governor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward Cornwallis</ENAMEX>), grim monument to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> military presence that prepared the deportation. The dispersal began out at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Grand-Pr√©</ENAMEX>, now a national historic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> commemorating the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acadians‚</ENAMEX>Äô resilience. This was the center of a thriving farming community which built dykes to reclaim marshland from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Minas Basin</ENAMEX>, grew <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetables</ENAMEX>, and raised <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cattle</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sheep</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pigs</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">poultry</ENAMEX>. Their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">farms</ENAMEX> were destroyed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1704</TIMEX>, recaptured by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1747</TIMEX>, and held <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">just eight years</TIMEX> till the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,000</NUMEX>-strong <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> was expelled, to return <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few years later</TIMEX> and re-establish their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">farms</ENAMEX> all over again. A stone <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">faintly</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norman</ENAMEX> in style, was erected in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1930</TIMEX> as a memorial to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Acadian</ENAMEX> culture and history. The bronze statue in the gardens is not a saint, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Evangeline</ENAMEX>, sad <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heroine</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Longfellow‚</ENAMEX>Äôs poem on the deportation. Along the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Annapolis River</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>, such pretty little <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Middleton, Lawrencetown</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bridgetown</ENAMEX> bear the unmistakable mark of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">New Englanders</ENAMEX> who moved into the region to take over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acadians‚</ENAMEX>Äô <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">farms</ENAMEX>.
On the estuary, the peaceful <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Annapolis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal</ENAMEX> was once the beleaguered target of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> and French sieges and countless pirate raids. Formerly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Port Royal</ENAMEX>, it was renamed after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">England‚Äôs Queen Anne</ENAMEX> and became capital of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nova Scotia</ENAMEX> until the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">foundation</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Halifax</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fort Anne National Historic Site</ENAMEX>, focus for the belligerence, is now a pleasant <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> of grassy knolls and ridges, remains of the earthwork <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">defenses</ENAMEX>. Of the original <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>, only a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">powder</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> in the southwest bastion and a storehouse in the northwest survive. The officers‚Äô <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">quarters of 1797</TIMEX> have been reconstructed to house a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> of local <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> culture and natural history. Epitome of the town‚Äôs more peaceful side, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Annapolis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Historic Gardens</ENAMEX> south of the city <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> display <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flora</ENAMEX> representative of the region‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhabitants</ENAMEX>: mayflower and pines for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Micmacs</ENAMEX>; iris and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetables</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Acadians</ENAMEX> grew, with a reconstruction of their ingenious system of dykes and a typical Acadian cottage; an <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> rose arbor; and Victorian flower beds. A marsh lookout gives you a good view over the estuary. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town center</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> and taverns on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lower St. George Street</ENAMEX> are being transformed to recapture the grace of the town‚Äôs <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Victorian era</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Port Royal</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 km/6 miles</NUMEX> west along <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Highway 1</ENAMEX>) is a fine recreation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samuel de Champlain‚</ENAMEX>Äôs timbered <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abitation</ENAMEX>, built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1605</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Furniture</ENAMEX>, utensils, and craftware, supplemented by audiovisual shows, give a vivid insight into the earliest permanent <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">settlement</ENAMEX> north of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX>. You can see how the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">settlers</ENAMEX>, just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> to begin with, made friendly contact with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Micmac</ENAMEX>. And hear how <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Champlain</ENAMEX> kept up morale throughout the long <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winters</TIMEX> with a social <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">club</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L‚ÄôOrdre du Bon Temps</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Order of Good Times</ENAMEX>). Each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> would organize a fortnightly banquet of game and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> he had caught himself. Among the entertainments they concocted to cheer up the long cold evenings was a play, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Le Th√©√¢tre de Neptune</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">North America‚</ENAMEX>Äôs first known full-length drama was written by the colony‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marc Lescarbot</ENAMEX>. His writings, along with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Champlain‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX>, provided the basis for the reconstitution of their environment.

The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX> outside the steel <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sydney</ENAMEX> is the most convenient gateway for both the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Fortress of Louisbourg National Historic Park</ENAMEX> to the east and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Cabot Trail</ENAMEX> to the west, leading to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cape Breton Highlands National Park</ENAMEX>.
You may like to drive the more roundabout <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">coast</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> over to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Louisbourg</ENAMEX> with a side trip to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Glace Bay</ENAMEX>. As an intriguing exercise in modern industrial archaeology, its desolate log cabins and colliery installations have become a coal mining village <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>. Take the fascinating trip along the shafts and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">galleries</ENAMEX> of the abandoned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ocean Deep Mine</ENAMEX>, which reaches <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">17 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">11 miles</NUMEX>) under the sea. You can have a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coal miner‚Äôs meal</ENAMEX> at the colliery canteen. The great <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> fortress <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Louisbourg</ENAMEX> is presented as a splendid national historic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>, one of the most elaborate in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada‚</ENAMEX>Äôs ambitious reconstruction program. You‚Äôll need <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a full day</TIMEX> to do it justice. After the guided tour, take time to discuss extra details of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> colonial life with the well-informed and entertaining costumed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">volunteers</ENAMEX> performing the roles of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fishermen</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">merchants</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX>, and craftspeople (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tel</ENAMEX>. (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">902</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">733-2280,</ENAMEX> <www.fortresslouisbourg.com>).
Building of the original fortress began in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1719</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six years</TIMEX> after the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Treaty</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Utrecht</ENAMEX> had left the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> only <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cape Breton Island</ENAMEX>. The ice-free port provided a year-round strategic defense of approaches to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gulf of St. Lawrence</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qu√©bec</ENAMEX>, and a commercial base for cod fishing, trade with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX>, and smuggling to and from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New England</ENAMEX>. The reconstruction of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one-fifth</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> recaptures life as it was in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer of 1744</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> before the first great <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> siege, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16 years</TIMEX> before it was destroyed.
You are plunged into the atmosphere of that ‚Äúmoment in time‚Äù as soon as you get off the park <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bus</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Georges des Roches</ENAMEX> fishing property, a long turf-roofed log <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cabin</ENAMEX> outside the fortified <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> may be laying out <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozens</NUMEX> of cod to dry on what are known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">flakes</ENAMEX>, the same trestled wooden racks still used in fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> all down the coast. At the drawbridge to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Porte Dauphine</ENAMEX>, the main entrance gate bearing a relief of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three fleurs</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de-lys</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> royal coat of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX>, you‚Äôll be stopped by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX> to check whether you‚Äôre a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spy</ENAMEX>.
If they let you through (they usually do), walk past the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dauphin</ENAMEX> bastion to the handsomely carved stone portside gate, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Porte Fr√©d√©ric.</ENAMEX> Turn right into the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> along the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>, past the hospitable eating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">establishments</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H√¥tel de la Marine</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L‚ÄôEp√©e Royale</ENAMEX>, where you can get a characteristic <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th-century</TIMEX> meal served on tin or pewter plates. Continue over to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">King‚Äôs Bastion</ENAMEX>, the military <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">barracks</ENAMEX> where living conditions show the kind of stark contrast that nurtured enough discontent to cause a mutiny in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that year of 1744</TIMEX>. The gabled <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Governor‚Äôs Wing</ENAMEX> numbers <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> luxurious <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartments</ENAMEX> with fine furniture, tapestries, silks, brocades, silverware, and delicate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">porcelain</ENAMEX>. The neighboring <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Officers‚Äô Quarters</ENAMEX> are more humble but still comfortable enough, while the ordinary soldiers‚Äô <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">barracks</ENAMEX> are downright miserable, with rudimentary beds of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">straw</ENAMEX>. In the middle of the block, a simple little chapel tries to keep the peace.
Back in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sydney</ENAMEX>, follow the Trans-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canada Highway</ENAMEX> west to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Englishtown</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">exit</ENAMEX> for the ferry across <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. Ann‚Äôs Bay</ENAMEX> to join the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Cabot Trail</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Indian Brook</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">This 300-km</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">180-mile</NUMEX>) trail offers one of the country‚Äôs most spectacular drives, with dramatic juxtapositions of dense pine forest, sheer cliffs, and the ocean. Travel north along the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gaelic Coast</ENAMEX>, a name amply justified by the thick <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scottish burr</ENAMEX> you‚Äôll hear from most of the very friendly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> you speak to on the way. At <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cape Smokey</ENAMEX>, so called for the fogs that shroud it in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> and a few unlucky <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer days</TIMEX>, take the ski-lift that operates in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> for the view up and down the coast and over to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cape Breton Highlands</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ingonish</ENAMEX> is a popular resort <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> bays with fine sandy beaches, offering excellent sailing, fishing, and swimming. Have at least a drink at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keltic Lodge</ENAMEX> hotel, an old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nova Scotia</ENAMEX> landmark worth a visit for its view of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cape Smokey</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Cape Breton Highlands National Park</ENAMEX> is a joy for all nature-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lovers</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Cabot Trail</ENAMEX> leads you around the periphery, but clearly marked hiking <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">trails</ENAMEX> (maps at the Ingonish park entrance) take you into the interior. Among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> hiking <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">trails</ENAMEX> the best are the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Glasgow Lakes</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">trail</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">John Deer Lake</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">trail</ENAMEX> around <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beulach Ban Falls</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mountain</ENAMEX>. Camping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> on the edge of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> are better equipped than those marked out inside the forest. These <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚ÄúNew Scottish‚Äù highlands</ENAMEX> look uncannily like those in the old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. To ram the point home, there‚Äôs even a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Scottish</ENAMEX> shepherd‚Äôs cottage, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lone Shieling</ENAMEX>, off the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">highway</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Grande Anse River</ENAMEX>. The forest, a mixture of conifers and hardwoods, shelters white-tailed <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">deer</ENAMEX>, black <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bear</ENAMEX>, moose, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">beaver</ENAMEX>, red <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fox</ENAMEX>, lynx, mink, and snowshoe hare. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bird</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">watchers</ENAMEX> can spot, among many <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, red-tailed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hawk</ENAMEX> and the occasional bald eagle. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Fishermen</ENAMEX> should get their license at the park entrance to angle for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">trout</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salmon</ENAMEX> (no motorboats allowed). On the northeast corner of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neil Harbor</ENAMEX> is a pleasant little fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port</ENAMEX> with sandy beaches.
To explore the northern tip of the island, leave the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Harbor</ENAMEX> and drive <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">16 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 miles</NUMEX>) to the fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bay St. Lawrence</ENAMEX>. Following a common seaport custom, the white clapboard village <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>, with its nave shaped like an upturned <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ship</ENAMEX>, was designed and built by local shipwrights. Take a bracing hike along the grassy cliff top west of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, but beware of the winds. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southwest</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ch√</ENAMEX>©ticamp is an old stronghold of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Acadian</ENAMEX> culture, with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> exhibiting craftware as it was crocheted, spun, hooked, or woven in bygone <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX>. At the museum‚Äôs little restaurant you can sample a traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meal</ENAMEX> of clam chowder, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meat p√¢t√©</ENAMEX>, and molasses cakes. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Expert anglers</ENAMEX> insist that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">salmon</ENAMEX> fishing near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Margaree Forks</ENAMEX> is the best in eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North East Margaree</ENAMEX> has a salmon <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> devoted to the fish‚Äôs life cycle and the cunning tricks of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poachers</ENAMEX>.
In a fairytale setting of wooded hills around <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Bras d‚ÄôOr</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golden Arm</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lake</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baddeck</ENAMEX>, a popular tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">center</ENAMEX>, likes to be known as the place in which telephone-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inventor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander Graham Bell</ENAMEX> chose to spend the last, very active <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> of his life. His <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX>, hidden in the forest, is not open to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX>, but the superbly organized <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander Graham Bell</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">National Historic Park</ENAMEX> shows how the great <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> devoted his energies in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baddeck</ENAMEX> to aviation. Besides his invention of the tetrahedral kite, the exhibits illustrate his work on the telephone and inventions of medical and maritime instruments. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> gives plenty of space to photos of his family life in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Edinburgh</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baddeck¬†‚Äî¬†which</ENAMEX> reminded him of countryside near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Edinburgh</ENAMEX>. If this has whetted your taste for things <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Scottish</ENAMEX>, end your tour at the southern tip of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. Ann‚Äôs Bay</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gaelic College</ENAMEX> gives <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> courses in bagpipe-playing, dancing, and tartan-weaving. Even if you‚Äôre not tempted to sign up, you can watch <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX> in progress. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Gaelic Mod</ENAMEX> gathers <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Scots</ENAMEX> old and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nova</ENAMEX> for a grand competition.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prince Edward Island</ENAMEX>
Canada‚Äôs smallest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX>, just <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">224 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">139 miles</NUMEX>) long and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only 64 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">40 miles</NUMEX>) across at its widest point, has a gentle rural atmosphere of rolling green meadows in the interior, with a coast of long sandy beaches at the foot of terra-cotta cliffs. The island nestles snugly in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gulf of St. Lawrence</ENAMEX>, separated from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Brunswick</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nova Scotia</ENAMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Northumberland Strait</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">More than three-quarters</NUMEX> of the area is given over to farmland. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rich</ENAMEX> in iron <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxides</ENAMEX>, the red soil is best for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">potatoes</ENAMEX>, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX> also grow succulent blueberries, raspberries, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">strawberries</ENAMEX>. If the island‚Äôs lobsters are a worthy rival to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nova Scotia‚Äôs</ENAMEX>, its finest <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seafood</ENAMEX> is the oysters of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Malpeque Bay</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacques Cartier</ENAMEX> named the island <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ile St-Jean</ENAMEX> when he spotted it in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16th century</TIMEX>, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> didn‚Äôt colonize it until after their retrenchment following the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1713 Treaty</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Utrecht</ENAMEX>. Like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nova Scotia</ENAMEX>, the island was transformed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acadians‚</ENAMEX>Äô deportation and their replacement by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Englanders</ENAMEX>, who named it after <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prince</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Duke</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Kent</ENAMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1799</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Englanders</ENAMEX> preferred to exploit their property as absentee <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">landlords</ENAMEX>, leaving it mainly to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Irish</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Scottish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX> to clear the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">forests</ENAMEX> for shipbuilding and agriculture. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">P.E.I.‚</ENAMEX>Äôs great historic moment came in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1864</TIMEX>, when its capital, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Charlottetown</ENAMEX>, hosted a meeting of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Maritime</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">delegates</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ontario</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qu√</ENAMEX>©bec to chart the path to <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Canada‚Äôs federal</ENAMEX> status as a united dominion. The new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Confederation Bridge</ENAMEX> connects <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prince</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward Island</ENAMEX> (at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Borden</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carleton</ENAMEX>) with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cape Tormentine</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Brunswick</ENAMEX>, raising fears that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> will lose its distinct character.
After <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">potatoes</ENAMEX> (winning <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">P.E.I.</ENAMEX> the name of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚ÄúSpud Island</ENAMEX>,‚Äù a less grandiloquent alternative to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>ÄúCradle of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Confederation‚Äù</ENAMEX>), tourism rates as the number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> industry. The superb sandy beaches of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">north</ENAMEX> coast attract <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over half a million</NUMEX> visitors a year. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Fans</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lucy Maud Montgomery‚Äôs</ENAMEX> novel <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anne</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Green Gables</ENAMEX> can visit here the landscape in which it was set.
After visiting centrally located <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charlottetown</ENAMEX>, you can take <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three well</NUMEX>-marked scenic drives around the island: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blue Heron</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lady Slipper</ENAMEX> to the west, and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Kings Byway</ENAMEX> to the east, corresponding roughly to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">counties</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Queens</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prince</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Kings</ENAMEX>.
Charlottetown
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">P.E.I.‚Äôs</ENAMEX> only <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> (population <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30,000</NUMEX>) sets the tone of the island‚Äôs low-key charm. Named after the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George III</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> offers a colorful mix of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">greenery</ENAMEX>, characteristic red <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stone</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Victorian</ENAMEX> gingerbread. It‚Äôs a busy <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX>, a commercial and tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">center</ENAMEX>, but remains resolutely old-fashioned.
Starting in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Confederation Plaza</ENAMEX>, visit <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Province</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX>, the sober grey sandstone <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Georgian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> in which the ‚ÄúFathers of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Confederation‚Äù</ENAMEX> met in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1864</TIMEX>. Originally a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courthouse</ENAMEX>, it is now the seat of the provincial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">legislature</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Confederation Chamber</ENAMEX> has been preserved with the names of the august <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">delegates</ENAMEX>, a very dignified setting for an affair that was in fact characterized by somewhat extravagant wining and dining.
Next door stands the modern <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Confederation Centre of the Arts</ENAMEX> opened in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1964</TIMEX> to commemorate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Confederation Conference‚</ENAMEX>Äôs centenary. The complex includes a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">art gallery</ENAMEX>, theater, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX>. Look in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">gallery</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 19th-century</TIMEX> work of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">P.E.I. portraitist Robert Harris</ENAMEX>, celebrated for his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> picture of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Fathers</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Confederation</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> is also the focus for the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Charlottetown Summer Festival</ENAMEX>. Across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hughes Drug Store</ENAMEX> is said to be the oldest operating pharmacy in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>. Many of the original fittings are still in place. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">You‚Äôll</ENAMEX> find exhibits relating to the island‚Äôs history in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beaconsfield</ENAMEX>, a gracious <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Victorian</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansion</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Kent Street</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July</TIMEX>, the annual <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Strawberry Fair</ENAMEX> takes over the grounds.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blue Heron Drive</ENAMEX>
The <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">190-km</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">118-mile</NUMEX>) circuit follows the north shore, with its barrier islands, windswept dunes, red cliffs, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt marshes</ENAMEX>, and around to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Northumberland Strait</ENAMEX>. From <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Charlottetown</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> north to the great beaches of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">P.E.I. National Park</ENAMEX>. The north shore‚Äôs amazingly warm <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22¬∞C/172</NUMEX>¬∞F in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX>) offers the balmiest bathing in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maritimes</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> includes the most popular attraction on the whole island, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Green Gables House</ENAMEX>, a neat white-frame <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">farmhouse</ENAMEX> with green shutters. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lucy Maud Montgomery</ENAMEX> lived here as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> and later used it as the setting for her novel, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anne</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Green Gables</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lady Slipper Drive</ENAMEX>
Starting out from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Summerside</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this 288-km</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">173-mile</NUMEX>) western <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">circuit</ENAMEX> around <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Prince County</ENAMEX>, named after the provincial flower, takes you through the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Acadian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">close to 15,000</NUMEX>) living on the south coast around <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Egmont Bay</ENAMEX>. Many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> fly the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Acadians‚Äô</ENAMEX> blue, white, and red flag modeled on that of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>, but with a single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">star</ENAMEX> added to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">blue band</ENAMEX>. Visit the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Miscouche Acadian Museum</ENAMEX>, just west of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Summerside</ENAMEX>, and an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acadian Pioneer Settlement</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mont</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Carmel</ENAMEX>. The island‚Äôs <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19th-century</TIMEX> shipbuilding industry is featured in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Green Park</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> and historic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Port Hill</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gourmets</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> straight for the renowned <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">oysters</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Malpeque Bay</ENAMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Kings Byway Drive</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East of Charlottetown</ENAMEX>, the longest of the circuits, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">375 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">233 miles</NUMEX>), encompasses pleasant beaches, rugged, red-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stone capes</ENAMEX> and coves, shady <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">forests</ENAMEX>, lobster and tuna <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">fisheries</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">potato</ENAMEX> and fruit <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">farms</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Orwell Corner Historic Village</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eldon</ENAMEX> includes some of the original log cabins built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1800s</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Scottish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">settlers</ENAMEX>. Visit the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Basin Head Fisheries Museum</ENAMEX> at the east end of the island.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Brunswick</ENAMEX>
With a rugged coastline and an interior covered <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">85%</NUMEX> by forest, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX> is popular with nature-loving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">campers</ENAMEX> in general and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fishermen</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hunters</ENAMEX> in particular. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglers</ENAMEX> can hope for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">trout</ENAMEX>, bass, pickerel, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salmon</ENAMEX>, while <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hunters</ENAMEX> go for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">duck</ENAMEX> and grouse. Wildlife <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enthusiasts</ENAMEX> may also spot red <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">deer</ENAMEX>, black <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bear</ENAMEX>, and moose in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">forests</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bay</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fundy‚Äôs 16 m</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> ft) high tides produce remarkable effects in the river estuaries and along the coast.
Linked to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nova Scotia</ENAMEX> by the narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chignecto Isthmus</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Brunswick</ENAMEX> became a separate <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1784</TIMEX> at the demand of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Loyalist refugees</ENAMEX>. It took its name from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">duchy</ENAMEX> then ruled by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George III</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Loyalists</ENAMEX> joined earlier <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">settlers</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New England</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Yorkshire</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Acadians</ENAMEX> who had trickled back after their deportation during the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Anglo-French</ENAMEX> wars. Today, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one-third</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> is French-speaking, the rest <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint John</ENAMEX>
The province‚Äôs largest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> (where it is the custom never to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">abbreviate ‚ÄúSaint‚Äù</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩSt</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äù</ENAMEX>) is a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX> in the estuary of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Saint John River</ENAMEX>. It is the center of an important paper and pulp industry and has <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shipyards</ENAMEX> and oil <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">refineries</ENAMEX>, but the city <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fathers</ENAMEX> have worked miracles to beautify the waterfront. Mists rising from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bay</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fundy</ENAMEX> add a touch of romance and mystery.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the town‚Äôs main attractions is the natural phenomenon of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bay of Fundy‚</ENAMEX>Äôs extraordinary tides, with a variation from low to high tide of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX> ft) at the mouth of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Saint John River</ENAMEX>. Watch the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Reversing Falls Rapids</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Highway 100</ENAMEX>. The tourist information <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> there will tell you the best times to watch the tides‚Äô evolution. At low tide, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fundy‚Äôs</ENAMEX> waters are <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4 m</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> ft) lower than the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Saint John River</ENAMEX>, causing it to cascade through a narrow gorge into the bay. Gradually the flow slows down as the tide begins to rise again. At the tide‚Äôs turn, the slack enables <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX> to pass the rapids before the flow builds up in the opposite direction. The bay‚Äôs high tide of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> ft) above the river thrusts all the way inland to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fredericton</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">130 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">78 miles</NUMEX>) away. On your riverside walk in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Falls View Park</ENAMEX>, try to ignore the pulp <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mill</ENAMEX>.
The bright new downtown area lovingly blends a modern and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19th-century</TIMEX> atmosphere, especially along <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">red-brick King Street</ENAMEX>. To suit all kinds of weather, skywalks and underground <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">galleries</ENAMEX> link shopping and entertainment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Market Square</ENAMEX> is the attractive hub of the harborfront renovation, a multi-level complex of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartments</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX>, and caf√©s, surrounding an <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">atrium</ENAMEX> in what were once just ugly <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">warehouses</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ocean Hawker</ENAMEX> II tug moored at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Market Slip</ENAMEX> has been converted into a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX>. At nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barbour‚Äôs General Store</ENAMEX>, an authentic <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">grocery</ENAMEX>, try the local specialty of dulse, an edible <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seaweed</ENAMEX> that is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Brunswick‚</ENAMEX>Äôs answer to chewing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gum</ENAMEX>. It was at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Market Slip</ENAMEX> that a contingent of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Loyalists</ENAMEX> landed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1783</TIMEX> to found the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint John</ENAMEX>. The event is commemorated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July</TIMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Loyalists Days festival</ENAMEX>, with processions along the harbor and dancing in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>, all performed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 18th-century</TIMEX> costume.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Brunswick Museum</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">277 Douglas Avenue</ENAMEX>) is devoted principally to the province‚Äôs grand old shipbuilding industry, the source of considerable prosperity before timber had to bow to the new age of steam and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steel</ENAMEX>. There are also interesting exhibits on the life of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Micmac Indians</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Brunswick‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bay</ENAMEX> of Fundy
Take <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Highway 1</ENAMEX> northeast from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint John</ENAMEX> and turn off at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Penobsquis</ENAMEX> to head for <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Fundy National Park</ENAMEX>, a wonderful nature reserve with an emphasis on the seashore and its spectacular high tides. At the park entrance, you can get detailed maps of the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">110 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">68 miles</NUMEX>) of hiking and biking trails linking campgrounds and chalets inside the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>. An arts-and-crafts <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> offers courses in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wood</ENAMEX>-carving and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">copper</ENAMEX> jewelry for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>, and basket-weaving and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glass</ENAMEX>-painting for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>. On <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Bennett Lake</ENAMEX>, you can rent a canoe or <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> from a rowboat. On the shore, walk along the flats at low tide to seek out periwinkles, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">barnacles</ENAMEX>, and sea anemones underneath the rocks. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herring Cove</ENAMEX> gives you a good view and detailed explanations of the tides.
Take a side-trip to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hopewell Cape</ENAMEX> at the mouth of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Petit-codiac River</ENAMEX>. If you can, camp <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">overnight</TIMEX>, as <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">dawn</TIMEX> is the perfect time to enjoy the view of its red cliffs and bizarre pillars of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">granite</ENAMEX> topped with tufts of balsam fir and black spruce, revealed at low tide. The rocks have been buffeted into what the tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> calls the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Grant Flowerpots</ENAMEX>.
Fredericton
New Brunswick‚Äôs capital is a pleasant, sleepy little <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> most notable for the splendid <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Beaverbrook Art Gallery</ENAMEX>. It was built by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Maxwell Aitken</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1879‚Äì1964</ENAMEX>), who as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lord</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beaverbrook</ENAMEX> became a great <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> press <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baron</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Winston Churchill‚Äôs war</ENAMEX> cabinet. (Although born in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ontario</ENAMEX>, he took his title from his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beaverbrook</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Brunswick</ENAMEX>.) Look for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Graham Sutherland‚</ENAMEX>Äôs imposing portrait of the publisher of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">London‚Äôs Daily Express</ENAMEX> and other fiercely patriotic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX>. But the gallery‚Äôs masterpiece is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salvador Dal√≠‚Äôs Santiago el Grande</ENAMEX>. Other important works include the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reynolds</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Turner</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gainsborough</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Romney</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> paintings by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Thomson</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Emily Carr</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cornelius Krieghoff</ENAMEX>.
The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-19th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Neo-Gothic Christ Church Cathedral</ENAMEX>, with fine stained-glass windows and wooden beams, seems transplanted straight from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> countryside. In keeping with this spirit is the Changing of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Guard</ENAMEX> that you can watch on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">mornings</TIMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Officers‚Äô Square</ENAMEX>.
Explore the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Saint John River</ENAMEX> west of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fredericton</ENAMEX> on a pretty <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">37-km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">23-mile</NUMEX>) excursion out to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">King‚Äôs Landing Historical Settlement</ENAMEX>, a reconstitution of a characteristic Loyalist <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the 18th century</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Veterans of the King‚Äôs American Dragoons</ENAMEX> established a logging and shipbuilding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> here, and their tasks are reenacted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> with remarkable authenticity. The waterwheel-driven sawmill still operates, as do a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">theater</ENAMEX> and an inn, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">King‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Head</ENAMEX>, serving old-fashioned meals. 
Newfoundland
Without detracting from the significance of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Columbus‚Äôs</ENAMEX> landing on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bahamas</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newfoundland</ENAMEX> can lay a just claim to being the true beginning of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe‚Äôs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adventure</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North America</ENAMEX>. Anyone seeking to understand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canada‚</ENAMEX>Äôs role in shaping <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North America</ENAMEX> should spare <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few days</TIMEX> for this bracing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX> of hardy <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fisherfolk¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†first <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">land</ENAMEX> to be ‚Äúfound‚Äù and last to join the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Confederation</ENAMEX> (incorporating <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Labrador</ENAMEX>), in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1949</TIMEX>. The land and seascapes are impressively rugged and the spirited <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> a sheer delight. Life in isolated fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> has given the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newfies</ENAMEX> a keen sense of local identity. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Citizens</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. John‚</ENAMEX>Äôs are ‚Äútownees,‚Äù those on the outskirts ‚Äúbay-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>,‚Äù and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> beyond are known as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äúoutports</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚Äù ‚ÄúCanadian‚Äù</ENAMEX> is still reserved for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mainlander</ENAMEX>.
‚ÄúSeek ye first the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kingdom of God</ENAMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù</ENAMEX> says the provincial motto. ‚ÄúBut on your way, look out for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newfoundland</ENAMEX>,‚Äù seems to have been the slogan of the old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North Atlantic</ENAMEX> navigators, from the good <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Irish Abbot Brendan</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the sixth century</TIMEX> and the wild <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Norsemen</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 11th</TIMEX>, to all the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Basque</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fishermen</ENAMEX> who preceded <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">explorer John Cabot</ENAMEX>, paid <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">¬£10</NUMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Henry</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">VII</ENAMEX> for finding ‚Äúthe new isle‚Äù in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1497</TIMEX>.
It was the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fishermen</ENAMEX> who really knew what the island was worth¬†‚Äî¬†the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grand Banks</ENAMEX> to the east of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newfoundland</ENAMEX> are the richest breeding ground of cod in the world. For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX>, the island existed only for its offshore <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>. Any permanent settlement was actively discouraged, so as not to compete with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Britain‚Äôs West Country</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">merchants</ENAMEX>. Even after the first serious colonization of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 18th century</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">forests</ENAMEX> of the interior were exploited just for building <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">fishermen‚Äôs cottages</ENAMEX> and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX>. No <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> were built away from the coast.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. John‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
Local folklore insists that the name (not to be confused with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint John</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Brunswick</ENAMEX>) comes from the saint‚Äôs day of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">John the Baptist</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 24</TIMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Cabot</ENAMEX> arrived here in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1497</TIMEX>.
Newfoundland‚Äôs capital and largest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> retains the simple allure of the fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port</ENAMEX> it has always been, and the picturesque harbor is the place to begin. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th century</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> burned down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> times, but it still stubbornly builds wooden <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> overlooking the waterfront. Their brightly painted walls add a welcome touch of color to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gaunt grey trawlers</ENAMEX> in the docks¬†‚Äî¬†from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>, of course, but also <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> and even <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>. Parallel to the harbor, you‚Äôll find on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Gower Street</ENAMEX> the prettiest Victorian <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>, painted burgundy, lemon, burnt sienna, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dove grey</ENAMEX>, and white.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newfoundland Museum</ENAMEX>, on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Duckworth Street</ENAMEX>, recounts the human history of the island, displaying the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dwellings</ENAMEX> and artifacts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Inuit</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">native</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peoples</ENAMEX>, including the now-extinct <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beothuk</ENAMEX>, and the costume, furniture, and implements of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fishermen</ENAMEX>. Another section of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>, in the shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murray Premises</ENAMEX> down on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Harbour Drive</ENAMEX>, is devoted to the province‚Äôs colorful seafaring history.
Safely up on a hill on <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Military Road</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catholic Basilica of St. John the Baptist</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1850</TIMEX>) escaped the numerous fires to dominate the town‚Äôs skyline with its <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">granite</ENAMEX> and limestone <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">towers</ENAMEX>. Down on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Gower Street</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglican Cathedral</ENAMEX>, also named after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">John the Baptist</ENAMEX>, burned down twice, and its simple <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neo-Gothic</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20th-century</TIMEX> version is still without a steeple. 
For the best view of the harbor go up to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Signal Hill</ENAMEX>, looking over the narrows and out to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic Ocean</ENAMEX>. The hill was fortified to guard the harbor entrance during the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Napoleonic Wars</ENAMEX>, and you can still see <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cannon</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Queen‚Äôs Battery</ENAMEX>, installed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1796</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Cabot Tower</ENAMEX> atop the hill was built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1897</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> centenary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cabot‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">landing</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diamond</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">jubilee</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Queen</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Victoria</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Four years later</TIMEX>, at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12:30pm</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 12, 1901</TIMEX>, in a receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">station improvised</ENAMEX> near the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> (burned down in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1920</TIMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guglielmo Marconi</ENAMEX> suddenly yelled: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>ÄúDo you hear that? Do you hear that?‚Äù What the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inventor</ENAMEX> was so excited about were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> faint dots of the letter S in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Morse</ENAMEX>, from his transmitter in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poldhu</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cornwall</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of dour <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newfie</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fishermen</ENAMEX> listening in were more impressed by this fellow jumping up and down than by history‚Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> transatlantic radio message. The event is commemorated by a modest exhibit in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Cabot Tower</ENAMEX>.
On the north side of the hill, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quidi Vidi</ENAMEX> (pronounced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kiddy Viddy</ENAMEX>) is a charming little fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port</ENAMEX> with excellent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">seafood restaurants</ENAMEX>. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first Wednesday</TIMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. John‚Äôs Regatta</ENAMEX>, a race for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">six-oar</NUMEX> rowing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX>, is held on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Quidi Vidi Lake</ENAMEX>. Begun in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1820s</TIMEX>, this oldest continuing sporting event in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North America</ENAMEX> is also the occasion of a boisterous carnival.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avalon Peninsula</ENAMEX>
The drive south down the peninsula from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. John‚Äôs</ENAMEX> takes you first out to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cape Spear</ENAMEX>, a windswept rocky promontory jutting out into the crashing waves of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Atlantic¬†‚Äî¬†easternmost</ENAMEX> point of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North America</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">longitude 52¬∞37‚Äô24‚Äù</ENAMEX>). This strategic position prompted the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> to install <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">anti-submarine gun</ENAMEX> emplacements on the tip of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">cape</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War</ENAMEX> II. The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1835</TIMEX> white <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">clapboard lighthouse</ENAMEX> here has been restored with a jolly red-and-white striped <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dome</ENAMEX>, while a less-attractive modern <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">concrete</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> does all the work. Down at the bird <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">sanctuary</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Witless Bay</ENAMEX>, you can spot penguins, puffins, guillemots, and little auks. Best sightings are from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-June</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-July</TIMEX>, when you can hire a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bay Bulls</ENAMEX> out to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gull Island</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Marine Drive</ENAMEX>, north of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. John‚Äôs</ENAMEX>, takes you up a characteristically craggy coast through the fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Outer Cove</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Middle Cove</ENAMEX>, and Torbay up to pretty <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pouch Cove</ENAMEX>. Look out for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">whales</ENAMEX> that pass down this coast in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX>. On the shore, you‚Äôll see the wooden trestled racks on which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fishermen</ENAMEX> still dry their cod in the time-honored manner. For a view of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newfoundland</ENAMEX> at its wildest and most magnificently desolate, drive beyond <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Marine Drive</ENAMEX> on the gravel <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> leading to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cape</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Francis</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BRITISH COLUMBIA</ENAMEX>
‚ÄúSuch a land,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rudyard Kipling</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1908</TIMEX>, ‚Äúis good for an energetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Columbia</ENAMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> largest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX>, is supremely the land of the wild <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">outdoors</ENAMEX>, with the constant challenge of rugged mountains, seemingly impenetrable <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">forests</ENAMEX>, a jagged coastline, and dizzily fast-moving rivers. But its capital is the smiling, sleepy <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Victoria</ENAMEX>, evoking a genteel <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> past that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> themselves may well have forgotten. And the province‚Äôs principal <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.7 million</NUMEX>, is the beautifully situated <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vancouver</ENAMEX>, home of easy living, elegant architecture, and all the color and movement of an international <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port</ENAMEX>. Loafers love it.
Long after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest Coast Indians</ENAMEX> had found the region to be a hospitable land of plenty, it was explored and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äúworked‚Äù</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Scottish</ENAMEX> fur <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> who called it <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Caledonia</ENAMEX>. When the discovery of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fraser River</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1858</TIMEX> brought in a flood of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adventurers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> decided it was time to take the land over from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hudson‚Äôs Bay Company</ENAMEX> and create the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">British Columbia</ENAMEX>. It joined the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dominion of Canada</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1871</TIMEX> on the understanding that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canadian Pacific Railway</ENAMEX> would reach <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">B.C.</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next decade</TIMEX> (delay nearly caused secession). The C.P.R. choice of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vancouver</ENAMEX> as its terminus gave <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">B.C.</ENAMEX> its major <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port</ENAMEX>.
The great boon of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">British Columbia</ENAMEX>, at least in the southwest corner where <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three-quarters</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> is clustered, is its gentle, relatively dry <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summers</TIMEX> and mild (but rainy) <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winters</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B.C.‚</ENAMEX>Äôs kind weather has been a major factor in attracting new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> in the westward expansion from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ontario</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qu√©bec</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maritimes</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">Trees</ENAMEX> are the main source of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">B.C.</ENAMEX>‚Äôs prosperity. The spruce, fir, and cedar provide <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three-quarters</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canada‚</ENAMEX>Äôs construction lumber and considerable quantities of wood pulp and paper.
Much to the joy of sports <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fishermen</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">salmon</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific</ENAMEX> coast and the great rivers of the interior remains another vital natural resource. The threat of overfishing has been cut back, and, in a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX> where revenues from hydroelectric power are second only to those of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qu√©bec</ENAMEX>, the energy industry has been prevented from damming the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fraser</ENAMEX> so as not to damage the salmon‚Äôs spawning grounds.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B.C.‚Äôs</ENAMEX> population (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4,000,000</NUMEX>) is concentrated around the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Strait</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Georgia</ENAMEX> and along the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> border, with scarcely any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhabitants</ENAMEX> at all north of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prince</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rupert</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are still mainly <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> in origin, most of them <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scottish</ENAMEX>. Other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ukrainian</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Scandinavian</ENAMEX>, and a few <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Native</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peoples</ENAMEX> number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 82,000</NUMEX>. From across the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX> has attracted a large <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">community¬†‚Äî¬†Chinese</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX>, and, of more recent arrival, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Vietnamese</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistanis</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indians</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Vancouver</ENAMEX>
The city‚Äôs setting in a magnificent bay embraced by soaring green mountains is one of those blessings that can turn any hard-boiled atheist into a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">believer</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cynicism</ENAMEX> dissolves with your <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> taste of the town‚Äôs gentle ambience, created by a clever combination of the comforts of sophisticated modernity with the simpler joys of the wilderness at its back door.
Expanding at a purposeful but more leisurely pace than other leading <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vancouver</ENAMEX> has never lost sight of the importance of enjoying life at the same time. Many business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toronto</ENAMEX> have been driven close to apoplexy by the relaxed style of their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vancouver</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX>. 
In keeping with this easy-going attitude, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> was originally known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gastown</ENAMEX>, after <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">saloon-keeper ‚</ENAMEX>ÄúGassy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jack‚Äù Deighton</ENAMEX>, who looked after the needs of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pioneer lumbermen</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sailors</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1860s</TIMEX>. It was only when the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> became <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C.P.R.‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Coast</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">railway terminus</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1886</TIMEX> that it took on the more dignified name of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the region‚Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">navigator</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Vancouver</ENAMEX>. A fire in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1886</TIMEX> and property-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">developers</ENAMEX> left few traces of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th-century</TIMEX> town, but bold contemporary architecture downtown and out at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simon Fraser</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">British Columbia</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">campuses</ENAMEX> blends beautifully with the mountain and ocean backdrop. Unsightly docklands have been cleaned up, and handsome new housing has been built on the waterfront.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First View</ENAMEX>
More than in most <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vancouver‚</ENAMEX>Äôs unique setting demands a carefully planned <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> view. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> is built around the broad <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">English Bay</ENAMEX>, which funnels through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Second Narrows</ENAMEX> into the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Burrard Inlet</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">waterway</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">George Vancouver</ENAMEX> explored in a scouting <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1791</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">harbor</ENAMEX> separates the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> proper, with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stanley Park</ENAMEX> promontory, from its elegant north shore mountainside suburbs of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Vancouver</ENAMEX>. To take in all this, you need to begin from not one, but <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> observation points.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cross the First Narrows</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lions Gate Bridge</ENAMEX> and take the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Capilano Road</ENAMEX> for a cable-<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> ride, ‚ÄúSkyride,‚Äù up to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grouse Mountain</ENAMEX> and its grand view south over the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> and harbor. Try to be there at sunset, too, to see the city light up. A favorite with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">skiers</ENAMEX>, the mountain also offers a fine view northwest over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Capilano Lake</ENAMEX> and across to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vancouver Island</ENAMEX>. If you feel like a quick whiff of the wilderness on your way back, turn off to walk the swaying suspension bridge <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">76 m</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">230 ft</ENAMEX>) above the fast-flowing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Capilano Canyon</ENAMEX>.
To get an equally impressive view of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> set against its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">mountains</ENAMEX>, go downtown to the observation deck (and its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX>, if you like) on top of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX>-story <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harbour Centre</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">555 West Hastings Street</ENAMEX>). A bonus on clear <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> is a view south, with the long-range telescope, of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mount Baker</ENAMEX> across the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> border in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">You‚Äôll</ENAMEX> find the information <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tourism British Columbia</ENAMEX>, at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">865</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hornby Street</ENAMEX>, useful for details about the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX>. For the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Greater Vancouver Convention & Visitors Bureau</ENAMEX> is at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Burrard Street</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Plaza Level</ENAMEX>.
Downtown
The main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> through the West End peninsula to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stanley Park</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Georgia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Robson</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Georgia Street</ENAMEX> continues through the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lion‚Äôs Gate Bridge</ENAMEX>. Though you will need a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> in this sprawling <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> it for your downtown tour and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">walk¬†‚Äî¬†traffic jams</ENAMEX> can be horrendous.
Start your tour of the city <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Robson Square</ENAMEX>, site of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the true masterpieces of modern <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">North American</ENAMEX> architecture, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arthur Erickson‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Courthouse</ENAMEX>. Characteristic of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vancouver</ENAMEX> architect‚Äôs finest works, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> is conceived horizontally, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only seven</NUMEX> stories high but still the dominant focus among the skyscrapers towering above it. Revolutionizing the whole stuffy concept of law <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX>, with not a marble column or <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">portico</ENAMEX> in sight, this sparkling structure spreads out in tiers of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">glassed</ENAMEX>-in walkways, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtrooms</ENAMEX>, and also <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, a small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cinema</ENAMEX>, and a skating-<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rink</ENAMEX>. Pools cascade from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> level to another among indoor and outdoor gardens of flowering <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">shrubs</ENAMEX> and rose <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">bushes</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">maples</ENAMEX>, orange <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>, and a miniature pine forest. An intriguing pattern of stairways and ramps collectively dubbed <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äústramps‚Äù¬†‚Äî¬†very</ENAMEX> popular with rollerskaters and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rollerbladers¬†‚Äî¬†runs</ENAMEX> across the plazas from corner to corner, attracting large <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowds</ENAMEX> during city celebrations.
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Robson Square</ENAMEX> also provides a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vancouver Art Gallery</ENAMEX>, in the old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courthouse</ENAMEX> (a proper <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Neoclassical</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> renovated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Erickson</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">star</ENAMEX> feature of this collection of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> is the outstanding work of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Emily Carr</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1871‚Äì1945</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúCrazy Old Millie</ENAMEX>,‚Äù as she was known locally¬<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">†‚Äî¬†‚ÄúKlee Wyck‚</ENAMEX>Äù or the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚ÄúLaughing One‚</ENAMEX>Äù to her <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Kwakiutl Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">friends¬†‚Äî¬†was</ENAMEX> a popular eccentric in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Victoria</ENAMEX>, where she kept a boarding <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and wheeled a pet <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkey</ENAMEX> around in a baby <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">carriage</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Years</TIMEX> of painting among the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">native</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peoples</ENAMEX> and studying with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">French Post-Impressionists</ENAMEX> produced a unique style of vigorous, expressive landscapes and totemic themes achieved with great sweeps and swirls of bold color. Look for the lush, dramatic Big Raven (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1928</TIMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Forest</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">British Columbia</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1932</TIMEX>), in which the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> have the sculptural quality of totem poles.
The section of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Robson Street</ENAMEX> between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Burrard</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bute</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> is known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Robsonstrasse</ENAMEX>. Now it has lost its distinctively <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> character to become a cosmopolitan restaurant row offering <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Vietnamese</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Scandinavian</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cuisine</ENAMEX>. Fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seafood</ENAMEX> is a great attraction.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East of Robson Square</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Granville Mall</ENAMEX> pedestrian shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">zone</ENAMEX> takes you down to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harbour Centre</ENAMEX> and the waterfront. From the foot of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Granville Street</ENAMEX>, take a bargain cruise on the commuter <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Seabus</ENAMEX>, which crosses <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Burrard Inlet</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Vancouver</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12 minutes</TIMEX> each way. Besides the ‚Äúfish-eye view‚Äù of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> and harbor, you get a close-up of the grand <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> Place, jutting out into the harbor like an ocean <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">liner</ENAMEX>, with a hint of the port‚Äôs <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19th-century</TIMEX> beginnings in its white simulated sails. Originally the national <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pavilion</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Expo ‚</ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Äô86</NUMEX>, it is now the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">B.C. Convention Centre</ENAMEX>. If you don‚Äôt have a taste for the down-and-out life of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Skid Row on Hastings Street</ENAMEX>, make your way east to the brighter colors of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chinatown</ENAMEX> along <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Pender Street</ENAMEX>. Canada‚Äôs largest <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX>, made up of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">descendants</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX> who worked on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canadian Pacific Railway</ENAMEX>, is much in evidence in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX> and vegetable markets, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stalls</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boutiques</ENAMEX> of silks and satins, bamboo and lacquer wares from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX>, and mainland <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>. Look for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> of traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spices</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicines</ENAMEX>, where reindeer horn and deer‚Äôs tail-tips are said to perk up even the weariest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>. Barbecued <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pork</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">poultry glisten</ENAMEX> in the windows of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozens</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> are drawn in by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">garish street d√©cor¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†even the telephone <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">booths</ENAMEX> have pagoda-style roofs.
Away from the throngs, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sun Yat-Sen Garden</ENAMEX>, at the corner of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carrall</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pender</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>, offers a rare moment of peace. This microcosm of nature reflecting the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Taoist</ENAMEX> philosophy of yin and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">yang</ENAMEX> was landscaped by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> brought in from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Suzhou</ENAMEX>, the great center of classical <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> gardens. A <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pavilion</ENAMEX> with a diversity of glazed roof tiles, carved woodwork, and lattice windows overlooks a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">subtly</ENAMEX> patterned pebblestone <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX> and the miniature landscape. Light is balanced by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shadow</ENAMEX>, and rugged limestone rocks (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">yang</ENAMEX>) are chosen for their pitted and convoluted surface, balancing the smooth surface of calm <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pools</ENAMEX> and quiet streams (yin). <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">Shrubs</ENAMEX> symbolize human virtues: pine, bamboo, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX>-blooming plum represent strength, grace, and the renewal of life. 
Duly renewed, then, make your way towards the harbor and railyards, to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gastown</ENAMEX> (between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Water</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hastings</ENAMEX>), the resuscitated red-brick, cobbled-street <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">district</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vancouver‚</ENAMEX>Äôs beginnings. This huckster‚Äôs paradise of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boutiques</ENAMEX>, souvenir <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> is frankly commercial in its polished quaintness, but with a certain corny charm. At the west end of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Water Street</ENAMEX> is the world‚Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> (and probably only) monumental steam-powered clock, signaling the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> with a resounding whistle. On <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Maple Street</ENAMEX>, a no less handsome statue of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gassy Jack</ENAMEX>, a distinctly derelict-looking riverboat <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">captain</ENAMEX> known to his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Deighton</ENAMEX>, stands on a whisky barrel symbolizing the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drinks</ENAMEX> he served to lumbermen, persuading them to build the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1867</TIMEX>.
Escape the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowds</ENAMEX> by heading east along the waterfront to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campbell Avenue Docks</ENAMEX>, where you can watch the ocean-going <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fishermen</ENAMEX> unloading their haul or join them for a hearty meal in the local canteen. And if the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Robson Square</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Courthouse</ENAMEX> whetted your appetite for the architecture of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arthur Erickson</ENAMEX>, continue this side trip out along <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hastings Street</ENAMEX> towards <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Burnaby Mountain</ENAMEX> (actually <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only 400 m/1,200 ft high</NUMEX>) and the striking campus of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Simon Fraser University</ENAMEX>. The spectacular focus of student activity is the great <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mall</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Academic Quadrangle</ENAMEX>. Note the delicate play of light and shadow among stairways and terraces under the mall‚Äôs truss-supported glass roof. On the way back downtown, swing over to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">B.C.</ENAMEX> Place, a vast concrete oval-domed sports <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stadium</ENAMEX> where the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">B.C.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lions</ENAMEX> play their football indoors. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stanley Park</ENAMEX>
Covering a magnificent peninsula proudly dominating <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">English Bay</ENAMEX>, this is undoubtedly one of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North America‚</ENAMEX>Äôs finest city <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX>. Its forest of majestic <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Douglas</ENAMEX> firs, cedars, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sitka</ENAMEX> spruce remind us it was once a government reserve providing mast and spar timbers for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Navy</ENAMEX>. At <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the turn of the century</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> leased it as a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>, named after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lord Stanley</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canada‚Äôs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor general</ENAMEX>. His bronze statue is close to the southern entrance. Turn east off <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Georgia Street</ENAMEX> to take the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9-km</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">51/2-mile</NUMEX>) drive looping the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>. More bracing is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sea</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wall Promenade</ENAMEX>, where you can walk, jog, or ride a bicycle (available for rent at the park entrance). Passing the immaculate green playing field of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brockton Oval</ENAMEX>, you may spot a <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">cricket</ENAMEX> game, reminding you this is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">British Columbia</ENAMEX>. A splendid <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Haida</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kwakiutl</ENAMEX> totem poles nearby illustrate the province‚Äôs other important cultural influence. On your way to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brockton Point</ENAMEX>, listen for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">9</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">o‚Äôclock gun</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cannon</ENAMEX> that fires at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9pm</TIMEX>, originally to warn <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fishermen</ENAMEX> of the fishing curfew.
Turning west, you‚Äôll pass on the seaward side a bronze statue oddly named <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Girl</ENAMEX> in a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Wet Suit</ENAMEX>, a version of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Copenhagen‚</ENAMEX>Äôs mermaid designed not to shock. Stop off at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prospect Point</ENAMEX> for a good view of oil <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">tankers</ENAMEX> and grain cargo <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX> bound for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX>. A totem pole marks the site where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Captain Vancouver</ENAMEX> met with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Squamish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tribe</ENAMEX>.
At the Aquarium the star attractions are the dolphin show and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">beluga whales</ENAMEX>, closely followed by polar bears. Equally fantastic are wolf-eels with crab-cracking jaws. Bears and monkeys seem to be having much less fun at the nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">zoo</ENAMEX>. You can walk marked <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">trails</ENAMEX> to picnic at the pretty freshwater <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Beaver Lake</ENAMEX>, from which the beavers were ‚Äúdeported‚Äù after creating havoc with the water system. The park‚Äôs popular sandy beaches run along the west shore of the peninsula.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">English Bay</ENAMEX>
Get away from the city <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> with an excursion out to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Point Grey</ENAMEX>. You can relax on the pleasant beaches; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wreck Beach</ENAMEX> is reserved for nudists. The grounds of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">British Columbia</ENAMEX>, one of the most beautiful college <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">campuses</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North America</ENAMEX>, are nearby; the terraced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sedgwick Library</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Faculty Club</ENAMEX> rose garden are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> notable gems set against a superb sea and mountain backdrop. The university‚Äôs pride and joy is the great <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum of Anthropology</ENAMEX>, out on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Marine Drive</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Point Grey</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arthur Erickson</ENAMEX> designed this noble <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glass</ENAMEX> and concrete-beam <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1972</TIMEX> as an explicit homage to the post-and-<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">beam</ENAMEX> longhouses of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest Coast Indians</ENAMEX>. Gracing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">lawns</ENAMEX> are a magnificent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of totem poles and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cedarwood houses</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Haida Indians</ENAMEX>, built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1930s</TIMEX> and faithful to a centuries-old technique and form.
Inside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>, alongside the artifacts of other <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">civilizations</ENAMEX>, the rich culture of the coastal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tribes¬†‚Äî¬†Haida</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kwakiutl, Salish, Tlingit</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tsimshian¬†‚Äî¬†is</ENAMEX> beautifully displayed and illuminated in a space where the roof-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glass</ENAMEX> seems to open the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">halls</ENAMEX> to the heavens. Compare the sturdy cedarwood canoes, built to negotiate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pacific‚</ENAMEX>Äôs coastal waters, with the lighter birchbark <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">craft</ENAMEX> used by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eastern Woodlands Indians</ENAMEX> for the rivers of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ontario</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qu√©bec.</ENAMEX>
Many of the sculptures you see were incorporated into the structure of a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> as posts and crossbeams. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Kwakiutl</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">giant</ENAMEX> accompanied by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> slaves, emphasizing the homeowner‚Äôs power and prestige, originally supported a massive central roof beam. Others represent the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">tribes‚Äô totemic animals</ENAMEX>, such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bear</ENAMEX>, protecting a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">human being</ENAMEX> in his bosom. Prehistoric stone carvings show the continuity of totemic styles. Some smaller figures, in soft <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">black argillite stone</ENAMEX>, were turned out by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Haida</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">craftsmen</ENAMEX> specifically for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> who found themselves ‚Äúcaricatured‚Äù in the carvings.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Notice</ENAMEX> the huge wooden feast dishes, big as bathtubs, for dispensing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">great ‚Äúpotlatch‚Äù</ENAMEX> ceremonies at which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tribes</ENAMEX> proclaimed their greatness by the munificence of their hospitality (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX>). An important part of the collection is devoted to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">silver</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">copper</ENAMEX> jewelry, and wooden masks and ceremonial rattles. Many of these are kept in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Galleries 6</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>, but don‚Äôt hurry past just because they look like the museum‚Äôs store <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX>. That‚Äôs what they are, but this so-called visible storage system is a major innovation to make permanently available the museum‚Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of art <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX>. Here you‚Äôre encouraged to make your own discoveries, compare the work of different cultures around the world, and just admire the sheer wealth of allegedly ‚Äúprimitive‚Äù creativity.
Just to the south of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nitobe Memorial Gardens</ENAMEX> are a fine example of classical <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> landscaping. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stone</ENAMEX>-lanterned paths lead you across <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">hump</ENAMEX>-bridged ponds to a traditional teahouse set among <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> maples and azaleas. The nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asian Centre</ENAMEX>, holds interesting exhibitions of the art, costumes, and photographs from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Korea</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indonesia</ENAMEX>.
Return to the city <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Point Grey Road</ENAMEX> and stop off near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jericho Beach</ENAMEX> to visit the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Old Hastings Mill Store</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">1575 Alma Road</ENAMEX>). Carried here lock, stock, and barrel from downtown in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1930s</TIMEX>, this is the town‚Äôs oldest surviving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">building¬</ENAMEX>†‚Äî¬†a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">post office</ENAMEX>, general <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX>, and the only remnant from the original <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gastown</ENAMEX> to have escaped the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1886</TIMEX> fire. It has been restored as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">turn-of-the-century</TIMEX> paraphernalia. Closest that wholesome Vancouvrites get to being <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bohemian</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kitsilano</ENAMEX> neighborhood here is popular with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>, young and old.
In the little <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vanier Park</ENAMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Burrard Bridge</ENAMEX>, you‚Äôll find <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> interesting little <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MacMillan Planetarium</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Centennial Museum</ENAMEX> is devoted to local history and anthropology. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maritime Museum</ENAMEX> traces the history of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port</ENAMEX>. Its showpiece is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint-Roch</ENAMEX>. This proud ship of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Canadian Mounted Police</ENAMEX>, sailed clear around the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">North American</ENAMEX> continent via the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Panama Canal</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Arctic Ocean</ENAMEX>, to plot a definitive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest Passage</ENAMEX> and hunt <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> on the way.
The area where <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">English Bay</ENAMEX> narrows into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">False Creek</ENAMEX> epitomizes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vancouver‚</ENAMEX>Äôs taste for the good life. The once miserable wasteland of run-down <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">warehouses</ENAMEX>, lumber-<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mills</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factories</ENAMEX>, and railyards has been reclaimed not only for the upbeat commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enterprises</ENAMEX> that are now a familiar feature of any <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> with a waterfront, but also as a handsome residential neighborhood. Under the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Granville Bridge</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Granville Island</ENAMEX> (really a triangular peninsula of landfill) is a cheerful collection of markets, caf√©s, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">galleries</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boutiques</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">theaters</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Children</ENAMEX> love it not just for the toys in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Kids</ENAMEX> Only Market but also for the water <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">playground</ENAMEX> around the fire hydrants and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">tons</NUMEX> of rubber tires.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">False Creek</ENAMEX> has given its name to a charming neighborhood of architecturally inventive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> set around garden-courtyards and terraces. The east end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúcreek‚Äù</ENAMEX> was the site of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Expo ‚</ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Äô86</NUMEX>, perpetuated by the giant geodesic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dome</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Expo Centre</ENAMEX>, now operating as an exhibition <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX> and movie theatre.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Squamish Highway</ENAMEX>
The drive over <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lions Gate Bridge</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vancouver‚Äôs North Shore</ENAMEX> suburbs along <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Marine Drive</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Upper Levels Highway</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Route 99</ENAMEX>) makes a gentle introduction to your exploration of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific</ENAMEX> coast and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">interior</ENAMEX>. With a view of the ocean from a setting of tall <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Douglas</ENAMEX> firs and red cedars among boulders, and the occasional swift mountain stream, the elegant or rustic houses enjoy a civilized microcosm of the classical <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">B.C.</ENAMEX> landscape.
Route <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">99</NUMEX> turns north at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Horseshoe Bay</ENAMEX> (landing area for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vancouver Island</ENAMEX> ferry) to become the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Squamish Highway</ENAMEX> for a spectacular <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">100-km</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">60-mile</NUMEX>) drive up to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whistler Mountain</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Coastal Mountains</ENAMEX> come right down to the water‚Äôs edge of the narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Howe Sound</ENAMEX>, some forming a little archipelago in the sea.
Stop off at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shannon Falls</ENAMEX>, a short walk away from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> on an easy gravel path over footbridges into the forest. You can picnic at the bottom of the cliff over which the water cascades. Famous for its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August</TIMEX> log-rolling contests, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Squamish</ENAMEX> makes a useful base for hiking tours into <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Garibaldi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Provincial Park</ENAMEX>. The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> sports <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whistler</ENAMEX> offers excellent summer <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX>, too: <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bicycles</ENAMEX>, kayak and river-rafting or more sedate swimming, golf, and tennis. Take the ski-lift for views across the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Coastal Mountains</ENAMEX> or stroll around Lost <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Lake¬†‚Äî¬†good trout-fishing¬†‚Äî¬†but beware</ENAMEX> of a pretty yellow flower known as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">skunk cabbage</ENAMEX> that smells like its name when you pick it.
As a delightful alternative to driving, you can travel from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vancouver</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Squamish</ENAMEX> aboard the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Hudson 2860</ENAMEX> steam <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX>, a regular old puffer giving you a close-up view of mountain and forest. The round trip takes <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">6 hours</TIMEX>, including a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2-hour</TIMEX> stopover in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Squamish</ENAMEX> allowing for a walk over to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shannon Falls</ENAMEX>. You also have the option of making one leg of the trip by sea (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 minutes longer</TIMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Board</ENAMEX> the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> train in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Vancouver</ENAMEX> at the bottom of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Pember Street</ENAMEX> and return from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Squamish on the MV Britannia ferry¬†‚Äî¬†or</ENAMEX> vice versa, starting from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Vancouver‚Äôs Harbor Ferry</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dock</ENAMEX> at the bottom of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Denman Street</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Victoria</ENAMEX>
Probably the most genteel <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> in all of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North America</ENAMEX>, this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> is of another age, another world. In its sheltered spot on the southeast tip of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vancouver Island</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> seem to be growing everywhere. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Geraniums</ENAMEX> in baskets hanging from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>-bulb lamp-posts in the city‚Äôs shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>; hydrangeas and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">roses</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lovingly</ENAMEX> tended gardens of the residential neighborhoods; <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">shrubs</ENAMEX> and more exotic blooms in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">city‚Äôs parks</ENAMEX> and conservatories.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the month of February</TIMEX>, while the rest of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> is still huddled around log fires and radiators, even just across the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Strait</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Georgia</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vancouver</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Victoria</ENAMEX> are out in their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX> and gardens for the annual flower-count. Yes, they count every blossom in town, and the figure regularly tops the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 million</NUMEX> mark. For <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Victoria</ENAMEX> is blessed with an exceptionally mild climate, with enough <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rain</ENAMEX> to water the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>, and an annual average (they count everything in this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>) of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2,183 hours</TIMEX> of sun to give them their brilliant colors. Even the air in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Victoria</ENAMEX> is sweet and gentle.
Not surprisingly in a town attracting an affluent retirement <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port</ENAMEX> is more pleasure- than work-oriented, filling its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">harbors</ENAMEX> with cruise liners and yachts, ferries and seaplanes. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parliament</ENAMEX> reminds the citizenry of the town‚Äôs venerable past and more serious role as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">B.C.</ENAMEX>‚Äôs legislative capital. Not that it detracts from the hallowed ritual of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX>-time, act of obeisance to a more legendary than real <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>. Good for a chuckle, but if it highlights <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Victoria‚</ENAMEX>Äôs resistance to the rest of the planet‚Äôs hustle and bustle, so much the better.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> is small enough to get around on foot, but there are also horse-drawn carriages and red double-decker <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">buses</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX>. The toy-like quality of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Victoria</ENAMEX> is emphasized in its most imposing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parliament</ENAMEX>. Built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1897</TIMEX>, it was certainly erected by someone with a playful sense of what might best evoke merry old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX>. There‚Äôs a bit of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">London‚Äôs St. Paul‚Äôs Cathedral</ENAMEX> in the massive central <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dome</ENAMEX> topped, for want of a saint, by a gilded statue of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Captain George Vancouver</ENAMEX>. The neo-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Romanesque</ENAMEX> arched entrance recalls the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> capital‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Natural Science Museum</ENAMEX>, and the smaller-domed turrets suggest something between an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Englishman‚Äôs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> and his county <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">council</ENAMEX>. The whole fairytale effect is enhanced at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> when every contour of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parliament</ENAMEX> is outlined by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of light bulbs.
Inside, you can visit the debating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX>, unmistakably modeled on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House of Commons</ENAMEX>. In the great dome‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">interior rotunda</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painter</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Southwell‚</ENAMEX>Äôs murals illustrate the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> virtues that ‚Äúmade‚Äù <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">British Columbia</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Courage</ENAMEX>, as shown by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">George Vancouver</ENAMEX> confronting the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nootka Sound</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1792</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spirit of Enterprise</ENAMEX>, with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Douglas</ENAMEX> establishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fort Victoria</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hudson‚Äôs Bay Company</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1842</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Work</ENAMEX>, by those who had to build the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fort</ENAMEX>; and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice</ENAMEX>, meted out to the unruly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mob</ENAMEX> engaged in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1858</TIMEX> gold rush.
Reasonably enough, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parliament</ENAMEX> grounds include a bronze statue of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Queen</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Victoria</ENAMEX>. It was she who chose the name of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Columbia¬†‚Äî¬†over New Caledonia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Hanover</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Cornwall</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Georgia</ENAMEX>. There is also a cenotaph, which is the focus of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual mid-September</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Battle of Britain Parade</ENAMEX>. You can easily get the impression that this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> is only nominally in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>.
Immediately east of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parliament</ENAMEX> is the newly housed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Provincial Museum</ENAMEX>, devoted to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">B.C.</ENAMEX>‚<ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">Äôs fauna</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flora</ENAMEX>, and a first-rate collection of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> art. In front of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> stands the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">62</NUMEX>-bell <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Netherlands Carillon Tower</ENAMEX>, a gift of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadians</ENAMEX> and tallest bell-<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>.
Farther east is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Thunderbird Park</ENAMEX>, home of the city‚Äôs most important collection of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carvings¬†‚Äî¬†Tsimshian</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Haida</ENAMEX> totem poles, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salish</ENAMEX> sculpture of their chieftains, and a reconstructed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kwakiutl</ENAMEX> longhouse. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">thunderbird</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mythical creature</ENAMEX> whose eyes flashed the lightning and whose beating wings rumbled the thunder, figures in many of the carvings in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>. At the sculpture <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">workshop</ENAMEX>, you can see <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">native</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peoples</ENAMEX> still practicing the ancient skills but with modern tools. Most of the park‚Äôs woodcarvings date from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last half of the 19th century</TIMEX>, but are restored and replaced when weather or <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worms</ENAMEX> get the better of them.
At the corner of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dallas Road</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Douglas Street</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Kilometer 0</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">7,800-km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4,680-mile</NUMEX>) Trans-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canada Highway</ENAMEX> (ending up, with the aid of a ferry or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. John‚Äôs</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newfoundland</ENAMEX>). It is here that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> and greenery of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Victoria</ENAMEX> begin their most delightful assault, in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Beacon Hill Park</ENAMEX>, an expanse of gently rolling flower-bordered <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">lawns</ENAMEX> and groves of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">cedar</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">oak</ENAMEX> sloping down to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific Ocean</ENAMEX>. Look for the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">38-m</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">114-ft</ENAMEX>) totem pole carved by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chief</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mungo Martin</ENAMEX> and believed to be the tallest in existence.
At the northern end of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beacon Hill</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crystal Gardens</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">conservatory</ENAMEX>. You can have <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> on the Upper <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Terrace</ENAMEX> overlooking tropical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>, exotic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> and repulsive reptiles. They are kept at a safe distance for the palm court <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> dances.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Empress Hotel</ENAMEX>, farther north, is so renowned for its elegant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">servings</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> that it schedules <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> separate <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> sittings <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">everyday</TIMEX>, and you‚Äôre advised to make a reservation if you want to participate. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Empress</ENAMEX> was built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1905</TIMEX> to serve <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> ferried across from the western <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terminus</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canadian Pacific</ENAMEX> and is the archetypal grand old railway <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX>. There‚Äôs a good replica of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Victoria</ENAMEX> looking decidedly unamused in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal London Wax Museum</ENAMEX> (in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.P.R. Steamship Terminal</ENAMEX>, near the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Inner Harbour</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal British Columbia Museum</ENAMEX> houses prehistoric and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">native</ENAMEX> exhibits.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Inner Harbour</ENAMEX> is a pleasant place for loitering among the yachts and seaplanes. The harbor‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific Undersea Gardens</ENAMEX> is an unusually well-presented natural <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">aquarium</ENAMEX> that you view from beneath the sea. Besides the exquisite tropical specimens, there‚Äôs a perfectly horrid giant <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">octopus</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maritime Museum</ENAMEX> in the old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courthouse</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Bastion Square</ENAMEX> contains some fine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> and navigational paraphernalia of the merchant <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">yore¬†‚Äî¬†whalers</ENAMEX>, steamers, and old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hudson‚Äôs Bay paddle-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wheelers</ENAMEX>. The star attraction is the original <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tilikum</ENAMEX>, a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">13-m</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX>-ft) <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dugout canoe</ENAMEX> equipped with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> sails to take <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Captain J. C. Voss</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1901</TIMEX> on a crazy <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three-year</TIMEX> voyage round the world. He sailed from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Victoria</ENAMEX> via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Australia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Zealand</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brazil</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cape</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Good Hope</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Azores</ENAMEX> to land up in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> seaside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Margate</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Emily Carr Gallery</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1107</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Wharf Street</ENAMEX>) presents changing exhibitions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Victoria‚</ENAMEX>Äôs best-known <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painter</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">150</NUMEX>), along with memorabilia and a short film about her life and work. The town‚<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Äôs Art Gallery</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Wilspencer Place</ENAMEX>, south of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Fort Street</ENAMEX>) has works of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> Impressionist <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter Sickert</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">watercolorist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eug√®ne Boudin</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> landscape-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painter</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th century</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adriaen van de Velde</ENAMEX>.
Drive <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">22 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">13 miles</NUMEX>) north of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> to a floral fairyland, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Butchart Gardens</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Pim Butchart</ENAMEX> made a fortune out of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portland</ENAMEX> cement at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the turn of the century</TIMEX> and found himself stuck with an exhausted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">limestone quarry</ENAMEX>. His <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> suggested turning it into a garden. The result is a bewilderingly beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">phantasmagoria</ENAMEX> of fountains, lakes, rock gardens, <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>: the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Sunken Garden</ENAMEX>, with <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">symmetrical Trees of Life</ENAMEX> and rockery of gentian, saxifrage, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lebanon</ENAMEX> candytuft; the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rose Garden</ENAMEX>, at its best in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July</TIMEX>, boasting <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">150</NUMEX> varieties of hybrid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> and floribunda <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">roses</ENAMEX>; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japanese Gardens</ENAMEX>, with <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">scarlet azaleas</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Himalayan</ENAMEX> blue poppies, weeping larch, and pond with a couple of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cranes</ENAMEX> to bring you good luck; and the dreamy <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Garden</ENAMEX>, cypresses singing a song of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tuscany</ENAMEX> around a cruciform basin filled with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> lilies, where once was Mr. and Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Butchart‚</ENAMEX>Äôs tennis <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX>. The gardens also put on firework displays and open-air <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">theater</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vancouver Island</ENAMEX>
Some <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">460 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">276 miles</NUMEX>) long and averaging <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">80 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">48 miles</NUMEX>) wide, the mountainous <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> is covered by the largest stand of lumber in the world, a boon to the province‚Äôs most important industry, but also a magnet for nature-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lovers</ENAMEX>. They hike or flyfish for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">trout</ENAMEX> in the interior and then make for the superb sandy beaches along the island‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">west coast</ENAMEX>, to picnic or troll for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">salmon</ENAMEX>. For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several thousand years</TIMEX>, it has been a favored spot for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hunters</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fishermen</ENAMEX> living around the sheltered coves and fjords that penetrate deep inland. Today, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 7,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salish</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wakash Indians</ENAMEX> still live on the island, well away from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> and tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX>.
Coming from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vancouver</ENAMEX>, board the car ferry at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Horseshoe Bay</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nanaimo</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> north on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Highway 19</ENAMEX>. Turn west at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parksville</ENAMEX> to cross the island on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Highway 4</ENAMEX>. This takes you through some of the province‚Äôs finest forestland: the red cedar of canoes, totem poles and longhouses; stately <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Douglas</ENAMEX> fir, mainstay of white <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">man‚Äôs bridges</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>, and flagstaffs; and the good old Sitka spruce <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">About 20 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">12 miles</NUMEX>) from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Parksville</ENAMEX>, look for a signpost to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Little Qualicum Falls</ENAMEX>. The well-marked walk loops around the upper falls tumbling into a ravine, then follows the river rapids along to the lower falls that crash into another rocky gorge. You can extend the hike along the river for a picnic or bracing swim at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Cameron Lake</ENAMEX>.
Highway <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> follows the lake shore to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cathedral Grove</ENAMEX>, a formidable stand of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Douglas</ENAMEX> firs in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MacMillan Provincial Park</ENAMEX>, donated to the public by a paper <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX> as a gesture for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> permission to exploit less accessible parts of the forest. Many of the firs, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to 76</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">230 ft</ENAMEX>) high, are <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than 300 years old</TIMEX>, the most ancient dating back to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 12th century</TIMEX>. Excellent explanatory panels trace the growth of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">majestic trees</ENAMEX>. Off the beaten track, you‚Äôll steep yourself in the atmosphere of a truly primeval forest.
Stock up on picnic supplies in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Port Alberni</ENAMEX> before driving on past <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Kennedy Lake</ENAMEX> and down to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific Rim National Park</ENAMEX>. Its sandy beaches are a delight, the powerful ocean-breakers being particularly admired by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">champion surfers</ENAMEX>. At the coast, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Highway 4</ENAMEX> turns north along one of the best <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> areas, the self-explanatory <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Long Beach</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">12 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">7 miles</NUMEX>) of fine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sand</ENAMEX> and first-class fishing waters. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hotels</ENAMEX> here provide you with cooking <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> for whatever <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish you¬†‚Äî¬†or</ENAMEX> a generous <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">neighbor¬†‚Äî¬†might</ENAMEX> catch. The boardwalk that rambles along <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Wickaninnish Bay</ENAMEX> will take you in and out of the coastal pine forest. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Florencia Bay</ENAMEX> is a good bathing beach, while <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Bay</ENAMEX> is the mecca for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">collectors</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äúworry stones</ENAMEX>.‚Äù These exquisite green, aubergine, or (most prized of all) jet black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pebbles</ENAMEX> are gathered from hidden nooks and crannies, sorted for size, shape, and smoothness of texture until the ideal stone is located, a highly subjective appraisal. All others are discarded and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">collector</ENAMEX> can be seen caressing the pebble, rubbing all worries away. From <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Comber‚Äôs Beach</ENAMEX>, you can spot sea <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">lions basking</ENAMEX> out on the rocks, with not a worry in the world.
For a change of pace, the sleepy <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tofino</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> of ecologists, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painters</ENAMEX>, and poets pursuing a style of life remote in every sense from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">B.C.</ENAMEX> mainstream. Take a look at the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">art gallery</ENAMEX> and performances at the experimental theater.
On the northeast coast of the island, the coastal <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cape Scott Province Park</ENAMEX> offers a variety of outdoor challenges and is extremely popular with scuba <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">divers</ENAMEX>, kayakers, and canoeists. Departing from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Port Hardy</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">B.C. Ferries</ENAMEX> organizes a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">daytime</TIMEX> or overnight cruise through the spectacular <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Inside Passage</ENAMEX>, between the densely forested island coast and the nordic fjords of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">B.C.</ENAMEX> mainland. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fraser</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thompson Canyons</ENAMEX>
This stark mountain landscape of pine forest progressively thinning out to more arid, craggy canyons above the fast-flowing river is the pioneer <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> that ‚Äúmade‚Äù <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">British Columbia</ENAMEX>. Driving east from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vancouver</ENAMEX> on the Trans-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canada Highway</ENAMEX> and following the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fraser River</ENAMEX> north to its tributary, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thompson</ENAMEX>, you are backtracking along the great exploration route traced by intrepid fur <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> from the prairies to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">It‚Äôs</ENAMEX> also the route unerringly followed by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">salmon</ENAMEX> between the ocean and their spawning grounds far inland. And, against all the odds of the terrain, it‚Äôs the route the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">railways</ENAMEX> chose to carry the riches of lumber, mining¬†‚Äî¬†and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> tourists¬†‚Äî¬†across the continent.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the most impressive sights on your trip will be the rivalry of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canadian Pacific</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canadian National railways</ENAMEX> in action: endless <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trains</ENAMEX> of freight <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">wagons</ENAMEX>, pulled and pushed often by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> engines at either end for the tougher stretches, snake through the canyons on opposite <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX> of the river.
Turn north at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hope</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yale</ENAMEX>, an old fort of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hudson‚Äôs Bay Company</ENAMEX>, terminus of its stern-wheelers unable to negotiate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rapids upriver¬†‚Äî¬†at</ENAMEX> low water you can still see their ring tie-ups on the river <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX>. A little <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> documents how this sleepy <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a few hundred</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhabitants</ENAMEX> was once a gold rush boomtown and the major construction <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">depot</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.P.R.</ENAMEX>
The strands of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">B.C.</ENAMEX>‚Äôs destiny come together where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fraser Canyon</ENAMEX> narrows at the torrential rapids of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hell‚Äôs Gate</ENAMEX>. For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, this point in the river‚Äôs descent to the ocean was the local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">native peoples‚Äô</ENAMEX> favored fishing spot for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">salmon</ENAMEX> swimming to their spawning grounds. It was here in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1808</TIMEX> that they helped <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Nor‚ÄôWester</ENAMEX> fur <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simon Fraser</ENAMEX> with his canoe past the rapids, over a swaying ropeway of vines strung along the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canyon wall</ENAMEX>, enabling him to follow to the ocean the river that bears his name. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1914</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C.N.R.</ENAMEX> blocked the salmon‚Äôs passage with rock-blasts through the canyon for the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">railway</ENAMEX>. The consequent <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90 percent</NUMEX> reduction of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sockeye salmon</ENAMEX> catch was remedied <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">only 30 years later</TIMEX> when <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">multimillion-dollar</NUMEX> steel-and-concrete <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> were built for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">native</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peoples</ENAMEX> are back again in areas like this, leaning far out over precarious rocky ledges to pluck with dip nets just a tiny amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salmon</ENAMEX>, compared with the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> caught by the commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">fisheries</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fraser</ENAMEX> estuary. Take the cable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">car</ENAMEX> across the gorge for a close-up view of the rapids. For a taste of what the fuss is all about, try a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">grilled salmon</ENAMEX> lunch at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX> by the cable-car <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terminal</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thompson River</ENAMEX> joins the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fraser</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lytton</ENAMEX>. Before turning east on the Trans-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canada Highway</ENAMEX> to follow the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thompson</ENAMEX>, take a look (just north of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Highway 12</ENAMEX>) at the dramatic effect of the confluence mixing the lime of the tributary with the clearer mountain waters of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fraser</ENAMEX>. The drier <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thompson</ENAMEX> valley soon takes on a more rugged aspect than the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fraser</ENAMEX>, with the sagebrush and lizards of a semi-desert, in places as beautifully desolate as a moonscape. The similarity with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">America‚</ENAMEX>Äôs southwest is reinforced by the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ranches</ENAMEX> around <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Kamloops Lake</ENAMEX>.
If <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">you‚Äôre</ENAMEX> here in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX>, you may see the spectacular salmon run, when the waters turn <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">scarlet</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of sockeye. Take the turn-off on the Trans-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Squilax Bridge</ENAMEX> to the junction of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Adams River</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shuswap Lake</ENAMEX>. On the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thompson River</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> can try the bumpy thrills of the sockeye experience for themselves with some whitewater river rafting organized out of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Vancouver¬†‚Äî¬†details</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> tourist information <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Okanagan Valley</ENAMEX>
Before heading east to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Rocky Mountains</ENAMEX>, turn south on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Highway 97</ENAMEX> to the lovely <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Okanagan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">resort country</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about four hours</TIMEX> east of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vancouver</ENAMEX>) for <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">golf</ENAMEX>, tennis, swimming, hiking, camping, and fishing amid <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">vineyards</ENAMEX>, orchards, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozens</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">trout lakes</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Okanagan River</ENAMEX> itself widens into an elongated lake with excellent sandy beaches, sailing, and other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> sports facilities centered around <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kelowna</ENAMEX>.
Across the lake at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Westbank</ENAMEX>, among other orchard <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX>, you pay for what you pick: apricots, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peaches</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cherries</ENAMEX>, plums, <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">pears</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">apples</ENAMEX>. At the southern end of the lake, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">resort town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Penticton</ENAMEX> stages a <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Peach Festival</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of July</TIMEX>.
Sunny <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Okanagan Valley</ENAMEX> is one of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX>-growing areas in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> (the other being in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Niagara Peninsula</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ontario</ENAMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Ten</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wineries</ENAMEX> propose tastings and sales of their not undrinkable dry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX> and dry <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">reds</ENAMEX> along with some more refined <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wines</ENAMEX> from the nobler <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> varieties: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pinot Noir</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cabernet Sauvignon</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Chardonnay</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gew√ºrztraminer</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Riesling</ENAMEX>. Among the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wineries</ENAMEX> you can visit are <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Calona</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Uniacke Estate</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kelowna</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mission Hill</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Westbank</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Gray Monk</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Okanagan Centre</ENAMEX>.
Hottest spot in the region, down by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> border, is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Osoyoos</ENAMEX>, nestling in the mountains around a good swimming lake and pocket-sized but honest-to-goodness desert complete with cactus, sagebrush, rattlesnakes, coyotes, and horned toads.
THE <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ROCKIES AND PRAIRIES</ENAMEX>
In this region, the great <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> outdoors really comes into its own. The national <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Rocky Mountains</ENAMEX> provide unrivaled opportunities for exhilarating contacts with a wilderness where you can really escape from your fellow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>: camping and hiking through the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">forests</ENAMEX>; fishing in the myriad lakes and rivers; canoeing and whitewater rafting in the mountain <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">torrents</ENAMEX>. And skiing, downhill and cross-country, has been greatly enhanced by the ultra-modern <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> installed for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calgary‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Winter Olympics</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alberta</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saskatchewan</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manitoba</ENAMEX> form the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Prairie Provinces</ENAMEX>, sharing the same rugged climate. The full meaning of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada‚Äôs ‚Äúwide</ENAMEX> open <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">spaces‚Äù</ENAMEX> becomes instantly apparent here, in the vast stretches of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wheat</ENAMEX> field reaching to the horizon. The eye is attracted not by some craggy obstacle but by the play of a sudden wind sweeping across the plain. The sky is spectacular, offering magnificent dawns and sunsets. Play the farmers‚Äô game of watching the weather come and go.
Stop in the provincial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capitals</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Edmonton</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Regina</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Winnipeg</ENAMEX> for a glimpse of the region‚Äôs history and culture. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monuments</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX> show how the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">buffalo</ENAMEX>-hunting <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">M√©tis</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">descendants</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indians</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> fur <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX>, struggled in vain against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglo</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ontario</ENAMEX>, themselves subsequently relayed by waves of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Eastern European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX> brought in to exploit the grain wealth of the prairies. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> sidetrip in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manitoba</ENAMEX> touches on another <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> adventure, up to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Churchill</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hudson Bay</ENAMEX>, the center of the great fur trading company‚Äôs northern activities. A bonus in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">autumn</TIMEX> is the rare <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúsouthern‚Äù</ENAMEX> appearance of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">polar bears</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rocky Mountains</ENAMEX>
If there‚Äôs one region for which you should reserve most of your superlatives and stock up on rolls of film, this is it. For all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> to western <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>, whether they be sturdy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hikers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">skiers</ENAMEX>, and mountaineers, or more easygoing loafers seeking to rest their tired bones in a hot springs <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">spa</ENAMEX> or bask beside a cool, sparkling lake, the sprawling national <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rocky Mountains</ENAMEX> are an undisputed imperative.
Straddling the border of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">British Columbia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alberta</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">North American</ENAMEX> continent‚Äôs grandest range of mountains stretches from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yukon Territory</ENAMEX> down to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> frontier. For the tourist, the abundance of superbly administered national <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">parks¬†‚Äî¬†Mount Revelstoke</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Glacier</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kootenay, Yoho, Banff</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Jasper¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†give the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rockies</ENAMEX> an edge over their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">counterpart</ENAMEX>, to which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> from south of the border will testify. (Some of the national <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX> charge a nominal entrance <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fee¬†‚Äî¬†check</ENAMEX> at the park entrance, as you may be stopped by <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rangers</ENAMEX> later on. You can buy a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one-day</TIMEX> permit, or an annual permit that admits the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicle</ENAMEX> and occupants to all national <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX>.)
The stark drama of the mountain landscapes derives from the fact that, in geological terms, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rockies</ENAMEX> were born ‚Äúyesterday‚Äù and have not had the time to settle into more stable forms. Waves of sedimentary rock lifted by vast thrust faults <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 60 million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX> have created a variety of striking silhouettes: the battlements of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">medieval fortress</ENAMEX>, sawteeth, or single <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pyramids</ENAMEX> like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Swiss Matterhorn</ENAMEX>. The highest peak in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rockies</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mount Robson</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4,320 m</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">12,972 ft</NUMEX>), just inside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">B.C.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mount</ENAMEX> Revelstoke
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">highway</ENAMEX> through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monashee</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Selkirk</ENAMEX> mountains to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mount Revelstoke National Park</ENAMEX> follows the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eagle River</ENAMEX> and the route of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C.P.R.</ENAMEX> on the crucial stretch that enabled the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">railway</ENAMEX> to break through the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rockies</ENAMEX>. At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Craigellachie</ENAMEX>, right beside the road, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 25 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">15 miles</NUMEX>) east of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shuswap Lake</ENAMEX>, a granite <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monolith</ENAMEX> marks the spot where the eastern and western sections linked up to form <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canada‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> transcontinental <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">railway</ENAMEX>. At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:22am</TIMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November 7, 1885</TIMEX>, surrounded by top-hatted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dignitaries</ENAMEX> and grimy overalled <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">laborers</ENAMEX>, C.P.R. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boss</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Smith</ENAMEX> tucked in his flowing white beard and hammered home the famous <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Last Spike¬†‚Äî¬†after</ENAMEX> misjudging his first swing and bending a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> spike over double.
Leave the Trans-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">11/2 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 mile</NUMEX>) east of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Revelstoke</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> to drive the winding Summit Road up <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mount Revelstoke</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2,120 m</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6,370 ft</NUMEX>), the only mountain in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> that you can ‚Äúclimb‚Äù by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>. This is the cozy way to watch the park‚Äôs landscape change from dense lowland forest, through alpine meadows dotted with wild <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>, to the bleak tundra of the high country. From the top you look out over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Illecillewaet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">river valleys</ENAMEX> and back to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Monashee Mountains</ENAMEX>. There are no campgrounds inside the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>, but if you‚Äôre planning to tent overnight along the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">65 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">39 miles</NUMEX>) of clearly marked hiking-<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">trails</ENAMEX>, check in with the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> administration <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> in downtown <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Revelstoke</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">P.O.

This is the place to get your detailed maps and fishing permit. In the creeks and lakes, you‚Äôll find an abundance of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">trout¬†‚Äî¬†rainbow</ENAMEX>, brook, brown, cut-throat, and red-spotted <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Dolly Varden¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†as well as whitefish, char, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bass</ENAMEX>. Nature-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lovers</ENAMEX> may spot elk, moose, and mountain <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">goat</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bird</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">watchers</ENAMEX> look for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">grey jay</ENAMEX>, blue grouse, and golden <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">eagle</ENAMEX>, while everyone should watch out for black <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bear</ENAMEX>.
The Trans-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> continues through the jagged <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">mountains of Glacier National Park</ENAMEX>, which counts <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 400</NUMEX> glaciers within its boundaries. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rogers‚Äô Pass</ENAMEX> was named after the major who found this corridor in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1882</TIMEX>, thus enabling the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C.P.R.</ENAMEX> to cut through the avalanche-prone <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Selkirk Mountains</ENAMEX>. It was also the toughest obstacle to clear for completion of the Trans-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canada Highway</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1962</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yoho National Park</ENAMEX>
From the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">railway depot</ENAMEX> and sawmill <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golden</ENAMEX>, the highway turns east to one of the prettiest of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">B.C.</ENAMEX>‚Äôs national <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX>, in the mountains and quiet lakes around the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yoho</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Kicking Horse rivers</ENAMEX>. Buy your food supplies at the parkside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Field</ENAMEX> and cut back to the signposted <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Emerald Lake</ENAMEX> turnoff. Just inside the woods is a pleasant picnic area beside the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">‚Äúnatural bridge</ENAMEX>,‚Äù a massive slab of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rock</ENAMEX> through which the swift waters of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kicking Horse River</ENAMEX> have forced a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX>. A <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX>-lick just past the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX> often attracts moose at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">dawn and dusk</TIMEX>. Drive on up to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Emerald Lake</ENAMEX>, a place of sheer magical peace, mirroring the mountains in its perfectly still green waters. With <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only one secluded</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX> on its shores, the pearshaped lake‚Äôs tranquillity is less troubled by noisy tour <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> than some of the more popular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rocky Mountain</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX>. The lake path makes a delightful <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two-hour</TIMEX> ramble through woodland, giving you a good chance of spotting some of the park‚Äôs small wildlife, notably some very chubby brown <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">porcupine</ENAMEX> and an occasional beaver.
Back on the Trans-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>, the turn-off <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">31/2 miles</NUMEX>) after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Field</ENAMEX> takes you past the park information <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> to a steep winding route through the pine forests of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Yoho Valley</ENAMEX>. Signposted on the right, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">13 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">8 miles</NUMEX>) into the valley is a short walk to the foot of the spectacular <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Takakkaw Falls</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Takakkaw</ENAMEX> is an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> word for ‚Äúmagnificent,‚Äù a fair description of the waters spilling out of the outflow of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Daly Glacier</ENAMEX>. Unlike many waterfalls, this one is at its most spectacular on the hottest <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">summer afternoons</TIMEX>, when the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glacier ice melts</ENAMEX>. For a panoramic view of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">glacier</ENAMEX>, take the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Highline Trail</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1/2 mile</NUMEX>) south of the falls, starting out from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whiskey Jack Hostel</ENAMEX>.
On the way back, stop south of the confluence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yoho</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Kicking Horse rivers</ENAMEX> for a view of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Spiral Tunnels</ENAMEX>. Watch <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trains</ENAMEX> entering and reappearing from the upper of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tunnels bored</ENAMEX> into the mountain to form a figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>. The lower spiral is visible from the Trans-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canada Highway</ENAMEX>. This engineering feat was necessary to overcome the steep gradient of the approach to <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Kicking Horse Pass</ENAMEX>. At the park‚Äôs eastern exit, you‚Äôll see where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">geologist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Hector</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1858</TIMEX> expedition mapping the major passes through the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rockies</ENAMEX>, was kicked senseless by a pack horse¬†‚Äî¬†thus the name of the pass. From <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Field</ENAMEX>, you can ride through the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tunnels</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lake Louise</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lake Louise</ENAMEX>
The fairytale setting of this blue, blue lake with its monumental railway <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Ch√¢teau Lake Louise</ENAMEX>, has made it the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">mecca of thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sightseers</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every year</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 km/2 miles</NUMEX> east) is very much a tourist-trap, but the lake (named after a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Queen</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Victoria</ENAMEX>) and its surroundings retain their magic. From the hotel <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terrace</ENAMEX>, before breakfast and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowds</ENAMEX>, look out onto the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">pine trees</ENAMEX> and snowy peaks of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fairview</ENAMEX> mountain to the south and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beehive</ENAMEX> to the north, with the dazzling white <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Victoria</ENAMEX> glacier producing startling reflections on the shimmering surface of the lake. Give the mob the slip by walking along clearly marked paths to the far end of the lake, with some pleasant <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">teahouses</ENAMEX> on the way. The path continues to the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Plain of Six Glaciers</ENAMEX>, requiring more stamina.
Take the mountain road <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">14 km</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">81/2 miles</NUMEX>) south to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Moraine Lake¬†‚Äî¬†nice</ENAMEX> drive, wonderful <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all-day</TIMEX> hike¬†‚Äî¬†to view the sawtooth skyline of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Valley of the Ten Peaks</ENAMEX> and the exhilarating climax of the lake‚Äôs clear <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">turquoise waters</ENAMEX>.
For a view of the whole area, take the cable <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lake Louise up Mount Whitehorn</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Banff National Park</ENAMEX>
The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> and most famous of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canada‚Äôs</ENAMEX> national <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX> began, as so many things in this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">railways</ENAMEX>. When the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C.P.R.</ENAMEX> reached <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Banff</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1883</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rockies</ENAMEX> were suddenly opened up to public access, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> decided, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years later</TIMEX>, to preserve the region‚Äôs beauty by declaring <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Banff</ENAMEX> a national <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>.
After <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> railway <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> discovered hot <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur springs bubbling</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">earth</ENAMEX>, their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bosses</ENAMEX> built one of their grandest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Banff Springs</ENAMEX>, a monument to be visited even if you‚Äôre not staying there. The turreted edifice set down in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bow River Valley</ENAMEX> has something of the fairytale castles of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ludwig</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bavaria</ENAMEX>. Take a canoe out on the river. If you‚Äôre feeling less energetic, take the waters at the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Cave and Basin Springs</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 miles</NUMEX>) west of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX>, or the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Upper Hot Springs</ENAMEX>, a short drive south. The springs are 29¬∞C (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">85¬∞F</NUMEX>) in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX>, rising to 42¬∞C (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">108¬∞F</NUMEX>) in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX>. The <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">eight-minute</TIMEX> cable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">car</ENAMEX> ride from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Upper Hot Springs</ENAMEX> up <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sulfur Mountain</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2,500 m/7,500 ft</NUMEX>) will give you a panoramic view of the mountains around the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bow Valley</ENAMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of many fine excursions is the drive along <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Bow Valley Parkway</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Highway 1A</ENAMEX>), then a hike along the marked trail beside the rapids to the lower and upper waterfalls in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Johnston Canyon</ENAMEX>. Back on the Trans-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Highway towards Lake Louise</ENAMEX>, look to the east for the crenellated silhouette of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Castle Mountain</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3,000 m</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">9,000 ft</NUMEX>) high.
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Icefields Parkway</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">This 233-km</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">140-mile</NUMEX>) drive on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Highway 93</ENAMEX>, up the spine of the mountain range from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lake Louise</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jasper</ENAMEX>, gives a rich sense of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Rockies‚Äô varied beauties¬†‚Äî¬†¬†glaciers</ENAMEX>, waterfalls, lakes, and canyons. Take <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a full day</TIMEX> so that you have time to explore some of the sights on foot. Stop <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Crowfoot Glacier</ENAMEX>, where you can see the foot‚Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">two remaining ‚Äútoes</NUMEX>,‚Äù the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> having broken away. The mass of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> facing you is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">55 m</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">165 ft</ENAMEX>) thick. At <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Bow Summit</ENAMEX>, leave the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Parkway</ENAMEX> at the signpost to the viewpoint overlooking the lovely <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Peyto Lake</ENAMEX>, a deep <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">turquoise</ENAMEX> at the height of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX>. If you have time, stop at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Kilometer 119</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Parkway</ENAMEX>, to hike up the winding path to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Parker‚Äôs Ridge</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2,185 m/6,560 ft</NUMEX>) above pretty alpine meadows overlooking the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Saskatchewan Glacier</ENAMEX>, the beginning of the great <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North Saskatchewan River</ENAMEX> that ends up in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hudson Bay</ENAMEX>.
Inside <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jasper National Park</ENAMEX>, put on good <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rubber</ENAMEX> or crepesoled shoes to walk out onto the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">ice of Athabasca Glacier</ENAMEX>, part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia Icefield</ENAMEX>. You can also venture onto the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice sheet</ENAMEX> in a snowmobile. Note the rock debris or rubble (moraine in the language of glaciologists) in front of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">glacier</ENAMEX> showing that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Athabasca</ENAMEX> is retreating¬†‚Äî¬†a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">hundred years ago</TIMEX> it reached to the other side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Parkway</ENAMEX>. At the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Parkway‚Äôs Kilometer 200</ENAMEX> mark, take <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Highway 93A</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athabasca Falls</ENAMEX>. A comfortable boardwalk leads you on an informative nature walk right up to where the mighty river plunges over the narrow gorge.
The old fur trading post of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jasper</ENAMEX> is now a refreshingly peaceful <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">resort town</ENAMEX> with a grand park lodge and fine <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> for rafting, canoeing, camping and other mountain sports. Take the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jasper Tramway</ENAMEX> ride up <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whistlers Mountain</ENAMEX> for a view of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockies‚</ENAMEX>Äô highest peak, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mount Robson</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the most attractive excursions is the drive along <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Maligne Canyon</ENAMEX>. Stop off to look down into the sheer limestone gorge at the roiling waters, sudden cascades, and tranquil <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pools</ENAMEX>. At the end of the canyon is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maligne Lake</ENAMEX>, where the great attraction is a boat cruise around the picturesque <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Spirit Island</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alberta</ENAMEX>
This <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ranches</ENAMEX> and oil <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">derricks</ENAMEX> likes to cultivate the image of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada‚Äôs Wild West</ENAMEX>. If its politics are often conservative (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponents</ENAMEX> compare some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> with the province‚Äôs cherished collection of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dinosaurs</ENAMEX>) they are of the adventurous brand favoring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calgary‚</ENAMEX>Äôs rodeos and the commercial extravaganza of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Edmonton‚</ENAMEX>Äôs celebrated mammoth shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mall</ENAMEX>.
With the discovery of huge oil fields after <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alberta‚Äôs</ENAMEX> economy boomed, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> exploded, and confidence soared. The enthusiasm is dampened occasionally by downturns in world oil prices, but the atmosphere remains decidedly cheerful.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alberta</ENAMEX> is very conscious of its geology. Alternating <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">600 to 200 million years ago</TIMEX> between dry land and sea, the region developed a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> and animal life that decayed to form the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coal</ENAMEX>, and natural gas at the base of the province‚Äôs modern prosperity. Subsequent floods and earthquakes left the parched <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Badlands</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Red Deer River Valley</ENAMEX> as a protective crust, preserving the skeletons of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dinosaurs</ENAMEX>. They were discovered by surveyors looking for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coal</ENAMEX> seams.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calgary</ENAMEX>
In this part of the world, in past eras, gold rushes created <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> out of a wasteland <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">overnight</TIMEX> and just as quickly returned them to dust. Soaring <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Middle East</ENAMEX> oil prices seemed to do the same thing for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Calgary</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1970s</TIMEX>, but the shining downtown skyscrapers that shot up then do not look as if they are about to crumble. Not that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Calgary</ENAMEX> was a wasteland when the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">post-World War II</ENAMEX> oil boom began, but it was little more than a cow <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, better known for bronco-busting rodeos than business acumen. Population more than doubled from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">280,000</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1961</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">590,000</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20 years later</TIMEX>, chasing hard behind the provincial capital¬†‚Äî¬†and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arch-rival¬</ENAMEX>†‚Äî¬†Edmonton. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> now boasts a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">944,000</NUMEX>. 
Hotshot <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bankers</ENAMEX> have moved in to handle the new wealth, polishing up but not eclipsing the frontier image. While hand-tooled cowboy boots and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stetson</ENAMEX> hats are still popular, the business suits between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> are increasingly sophisticated, even <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> in cut, leaving the string ties and blue jeans for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stampede</ENAMEX>.
The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten days</TIMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calgary Stampede</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first half of July</TIMEX> are, by any standards, anthropological or purely hedonistic, a phenomenon to be experienced. Cowboy hyperbole demands that it be known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚ÄúGreatest Outdoor Show</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX>,‚Äù a title dating back to its beginnings in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1912</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stampede</ENAMEX> was originally conceived to show all the techniques and excitement of rounding up <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cattle</ENAMEX> on the prairies. Today, at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Stampede Park</ENAMEX>, it does indeed stage agricultural and garden exhibitions, displays of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crafts</ENAMEX> and dancing, and all the sideshows of a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> fair. But after the grand opening parade of baton-twirling majorettes, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cowboys</ENAMEX>, costumed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indians</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">champion</ENAMEX> steers, and smiling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stars</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chamber of commerce</ENAMEX>, the great attraction remains the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">rodeo</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Bareback</ENAMEX> riding and bronco-busting, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bull</ENAMEX> riding and steer-wrestling, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">calf-roping</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buffalo</ENAMEX> riding culminate in marvelous chuck-<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">wagon</ENAMEX> races.

Just as much fun as the official events are the square dancing in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>, firework displays, barbecue dinners, and flapjack breakfasts.
Spend a more sober moment in the fascinating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Glenbow Museum</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">130</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ninth Avenue S.E.</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beautifully</ENAMEX> arranged exhibits of furniture, costumes, utensils, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX> give a vivid picture of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alberta</ENAMEX> life, from the pioneers‚Äô log-cabin <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homesteads</ENAMEX> to the modern artifacts of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drillers</ENAMEX>, railway-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">builders</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">miners</ENAMEX>.

Drumheller
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">area</ENAMEX> around this old coalmining <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> is famous for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">prehistoric</ENAMEX> fossils and remarkably complete remains of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dinosaurs</ENAMEX> whose stamping grounds were the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Badlands</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Red Deer River Valley</ENAMEX>.

Even at the height of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX>, take warm clothes for the brisk evenings. The little <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> has a true frontier atmosphere to it. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hudson‚Äôs Bay Company</ENAMEX> established a trading post here in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1717</TIMEX>, and its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX> on the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> is still the place to get camping and hiking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gear¬†‚Äî¬†or</ENAMEX> long underwear if a sudden blizzard blows up. Inuit craft <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> offer not souvenir junk but genuine native <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">handwork</ENAMEX>, and leather and fur goods that do not infringe protected-species laws. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eskimo Museum</ENAMEX> gives a good insight into <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Inuit</ENAMEX> life and art around <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hudson Bay</ENAMEX>.
Wildlife tours around the bay and across the otherwise inaccessible hinterland are organized in giant-wheeled or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-track tundra buggies (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>- and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">full-day</TIMEX> excursions or overnight camping trips). Several boat tours explore the bay for close-up sightings of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">beluga whale</ENAMEX> and cruise over to the ruins of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fort Prince of Wales</ENAMEX> on a promontory at the mouth of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Churchill River</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hudson‚Äôs Bay Company‚</ENAMEX>Äôs massive stone <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fortress</ENAMEX> surrendered to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">navigator</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">La P√</ENAMEX>©rouse in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1782</TIMEX>, without firing a single shot.
If you want to explore on your own, rent a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> and drive round the harbor and its monumental <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">grain elevators</ENAMEX> on the way to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cape Merry</ENAMEX> for a good view of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">fort</ENAMEX>, especially at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">sunset</ENAMEX>. Take your binoculars to follow the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">beluga whales</ENAMEX> that swim with the summer tide in and out of the river estuary.
THE <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NORTH</ENAMEX>
Every <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> needs its mythic place, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canada‚</ENAMEX>Äôs is the fabled <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">icy ‚Äúwasteland‚Äù</ENAMEX> in which the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> and the world like to cloak the national image. But there‚Äôs a fascinating reality ‚ÄúNorth of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60,‚</NUMEX>Äù as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locals</ENAMEX> call the territories above the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60¬∞</NUMEX> latitude, ignored until recently by everybody but the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Inuit</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">native people</ENAMEX> who live there, plus a few explorers and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">miners</ENAMEX>. Even <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, if they ever staged a <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">football</ENAMEX> game between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yukon</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Northwest Territories</ENAMEX>, the whole <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> could be comfortably seated in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stadium</ENAMEX>.
But more and more adventurers from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúthe outside‚Äù <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Yukon‚Äôs rugged mountains</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest Territories‚</ENAMEX>Äô eerily beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Arctic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wastes</ENAMEX> (the northernmost point is just <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">830 km/500 miles</NUMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pole</ENAMEX>). In the old Klondike boomtowns, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> find a whiff of romance from the great <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX> rush of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1897</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lovers</ENAMEX> of the outdoors track the last <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">free-roaming</ENAMEX> bison <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">herds</ENAMEX> or fly in for the challenge of fishing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">trout</ENAMEX> and grayling in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Great Slave</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Great Bear</ENAMEX> lakes. 
Access by road takes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several days</TIMEX>, but there are plenty of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">airlines</ENAMEX> serving the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whitehorse; Yellowknife</ENAMEX>; and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Frobisher Bay</ENAMEX> (for access, via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pangnirtung</ENAMEX>, to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Auyuittuq National Park</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baffin Island</ENAMEX>).
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yukon</ENAMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Klondike</ENAMEX> gold rush did more than fire the western world‚Äôs imagination with scores of novels, epic poems, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">films¬†‚Äî¬†it</ENAMEX> immediately opened up a whole vast territory with such mundane services as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">railways</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX>, telephones, electricity, and hot and cold running <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>. In a subarctic land of soaring mountains and elongated glacial lakes beside the great <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yukon River</ENAMEX>, today‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> can thank yesterday‚Äôs prospectors for using part of their paydirt for some essential creature comforts. Close to the original action and still providing the most vivid testimony to the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Klondike days</TIMEX>, the boomtown of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dawson City</ENAMEX> yielded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1951</TIMEX> to the transportation and communications <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">center</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whitehorse</ENAMEX> as territorial capital.
Whitehorse
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> grew up as the terminus where prospectors transferred from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Skagway</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yukon River</ENAMEX> steamboats and is now the junction of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alaska</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Klondike highways</ENAMEX>.
Though a thoroughly modern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23,000</NUMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yukon</ENAMEX> capital is proud of its <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Old Log Church on Elliot Street</ENAMEX> and some <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-story log cabins it calls ‚Äúwooden skyscrapers.‚Äù One of them <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MacBride Museum</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Avenue</ENAMEX>), with a good collection of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX> rush memorabilia and exhibits of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yukon</ENAMEX> wildlife.
You can visit a sternwheel riverboat, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">S.S. Klondike</ENAMEX>, moored at the end of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Second Avenue</ENAMEX>. Upriver, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 miles</NUMEX>) south of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, take a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2-hour</TIMEX> cruise through <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miles Canyon on the M.V. Schwatka</ENAMEX>. At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Black Mike‚Äôs Gold Mine</ENAMEX>, a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">30-km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">18-mile</NUMEX>) drive south of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whitehorse</ENAMEX>, you can try your own hand at panning for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dawson City</ENAMEX>
A <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">day‚Äôs</NUMEX> drive from Whitehorse along the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Klondike Highway</ENAMEX>, the old boomtown counts scarcely <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhabitants</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, but the national <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks system</ENAMEX> has done a nice tongue-in-cheek job of reconstructing the monuments of its heyday. The history of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dawson City</ENAMEX> is further celebrated by a couple of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> events. This is the place to be in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the week of August 17</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Discovery Day</ENAMEX>, for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Klondike River</ENAMEX> raft-races, costumed <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>-parades, music, and dancing. If you miss it, look out for the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Outhouse-On-Wheels</ENAMEX> race at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the beginning of September</TIMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the town‚Äôs major year-round attractions is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diamond Tooth Gertie‚Äôs Gambling Hall</ENAMEX>, an old-fashioned (and legal) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">casino</ENAMEX>, where red-gartered dancing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> kick it up to a honky-tonk piano. The gaudy <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Palace Grand Theatre</ENAMEX> is famous for its vaudeville, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gaslight Follies</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Paul‚Äôs Church</ENAMEX> shows a good film on the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Klondike days</TIMEX>, while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dawson City Museum</ENAMEX> gives you all the inside information about gold-mining, displaying prospectors‚Äô tools and paraphernalia. Behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> is the log cabin of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Robert Service</ENAMEX>, the diggers‚Äô bard celebrated for <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Shooting of Dan McGrew and The Cremation</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam McGee</ENAMEX>. He himself avoided the tough life of the gold-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">miner</ENAMEX> for a cozy job at the local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX>. And next door is the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">home</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack London</ENAMEX>, who made more money from his novels of the wild <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North</ENAMEX> than from the stake he worked on at nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Henderson Creek</ENAMEX>. Both literary shrines hold readings from the masters‚Äô works.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kluane National Park</ENAMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">About 150 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">90 miles</NUMEX>) west of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whitehorse</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alaska Highway</ENAMEX>, the entrance to this wilderness reserve is at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Haines Junction</ENAMEX>.

The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX>, when temperatures climb to a comfortable 21¬∞C (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">70¬∞F</NUMEX>) in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mackenzie District</ENAMEX>, offers the blessed privilege of a dazzling explosion of wild <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>. Beluga <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">whales</ENAMEX> come out to play around <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baffin Island</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">autumn</TIMEX>, the magical northern lights of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">aurora borealis</ENAMEX> are at their most brilliant.
Yellowknife
On the north shore of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Great Slave Lake</ENAMEX>, the territorial capital is a modern industrial gold-mining <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> serving as a convenient base from which <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">campers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fishermen</ENAMEX> explore the interior.
