A Brief History
In ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> mythology <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> is named following a contest between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Athena</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">goddess</ENAMEX> of wisdom, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Poseidon</ENAMEX>, god of the sea. Both had their eye on the prize real estate, so it was agreed that whoever could come up with the more useful gift for mortals would win. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-human, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">serpent</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cecrops</ENAMEX>, acted as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arbiter</ENAMEX>. 
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX> came <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Poseidon</ENAMEX>, who struck the rock of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acropolis</ENAMEX> with his mighty trident and brought <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt water</ENAMEX> gushing forth. Then it was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Athena‚</ENAMEX>Äôs turn. As she struck the rock an olive <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> appeared, which proved more useful and valuable. Thus she acquired the position of the city‚Äôs special <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">protector</ENAMEX>.
The actual history of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>-state of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> is just as fascinating as its mythology. From around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> b.c. wandering bands filtered into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asia Minor</ENAMEX>. Known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Achaeans</ENAMEX>, they were the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>-speaking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in the area, and over the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX> they built many imposing fortresses and developed the rich <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mycenaean</ENAMEX> civilization, based in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peloponnese</ENAMEX>. The citadel at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mycenae</ENAMEX>, seat of this most powerful of early <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> cultures, was erected to the south of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX>. Surrounded by a pair of precipitous ravines, the imposing walls of the citadel were <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">some forty feet</NUMEX> high and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">twenty feet</NUMEX> thick, virtually impregnable.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Achaeans‚Äô</ENAMEX> chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rivals</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mentors</ENAMEX> were the dazzling <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Minoans</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Crete¬†‚Äî¬†until</ENAMEX> about 1450 b.c., when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Minoan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX> was devastated, possibly by tidal waves caused by the eruption of the volcanic island of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thera</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santorini</ENAMEX>). From the seafaring <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Minoans</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Myceneans</ENAMEX> learned to make <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bronze</ENAMEX> by combining <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">copper</ENAMEX> and tin and, with no written language of their own, they adpated the linear script used by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minoan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scribes</ENAMEX>. For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several centuries</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mycenaeans</ENAMEX> dominated the eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aegean</ENAMEX>. A long series of conflicts, however, including the legendary siege of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Troy</ENAMEX>, weakened these mighty mainland <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">warriors</ENAMEX>.
Around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1100</TIMEX> b.c. waves of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dorians</ENAMEX> swept into the area on horseback. Armed with iron <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spears</ENAMEX> and shields, they overpowered the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bronze Age</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mycenae</ENAMEX> and broke down the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peloponnesian</ENAMEX> bastions. The ensuing ‚Äúdark age‚Äù lasted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about three centuries</TIMEX> and resulted in large-scale emigrations of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greeks</ENAMEX> around the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Athens</ENAMEX> managed to escape the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scourge</ENAMEX>, but only after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">700 b.c.</TIMEX> did it take over and lift to unimagined heights the heritage of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mycenae and Crete</ENAMEX>. Although they warred as often as they united, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> and surrounding city-states on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Attica</ENAMEX> peninsula, notably <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sparta</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thebes</ENAMEX>, shared a sense of identity. They were all <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Greeks‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthey</ENAMEX> had a common tongue and an evolving pan-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hellenic</ENAMEX> religion, and at regular intervals they were brought together by the ritual athletic contest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Olympian, Delphian</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Isthmian</ENAMEX> games.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX>, the largest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>-state, gradually embraced all of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Attica</ENAMEX> peninsula. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">King Theseus</ENAMEX>, the legendary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ruler</ENAMEX> who slew the minotaur in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cretan</ENAMEX> labyrinth, was revered by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Athenians</ENAMEX> for bringing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Attica‚</ENAMEX>Äôs scattered and independent <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> under the rule of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acropolis</ENAMEX>. Countless urns and jars were decorated with drawings of his heroic exploits, but in fact he belongs to myth rather than to history. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> actually merged with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> in exchange for protection, a share of state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>, and full citizenship rights.
From Aristocracy to Democracy
During the dark ages <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> had been a monarchy, but it emerged as an oligarchy in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the seventh century</TIMEX> b.c. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> great historical figure of that new era was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Solon¬†‚Äî¬†general</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">merchant</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poet</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sage¬†‚Äî¬†who</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">594</NUMEX> b.c. became chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">magistrate</ENAMEX>. At that time, civil war threatened to break out between the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">state‚Äôs ‚Äúhaves‚Äù</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äúhave nots‚Äù</ENAMEX> (an expression from ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX>). Armed with almost absolute powers, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Solon</ENAMEX> produced a constitution advancing the ideal of equality before the law for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> of all classes, set up a trial<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">-by-</NUMEX>jury system, freed the peasantry from debt to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">landowners</ENAMEX>, and introduced far-sighted reforms that revived the languishing economy.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the middle of the sixth century</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Athens‚Äô</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">first dictator</ENAMEX> took power. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peisistratus</ENAMEX> established a dynasty that remained in uninterrupted power for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a century</TIMEX>. On <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> occasion when he was forced from power, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peisistratus</ENAMEX> dressed a tall, beautiful country <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> to look like the goddess <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Athena</ENAMEX>, and then entered <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> in triumph with the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">‚Äúgoddess‚Äù</ENAMEX> leading his procession. Peisistratus, a resourceful and relatively benign tyrant, continued to steer <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> towards greatness. Under his rule, commerce and the arts flourished: Attica‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> and olive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> were shipped to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asia Minor</ENAMEX> in beautiful black-figure pots; the first tragedies ever written were performed at the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">festival</ENAMEX> of the wine god, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dionysus</ENAMEX>; and the standard version of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Homer‚Äôs</ENAMEX> works was set down.
However, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peisistratus‚</ENAMEX>Äô <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">successors</ENAMEX> proved less popular, and democracy was eventually re-established by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX>. Cleisthenes, recognized by history as the true <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Athenian</ENAMEX> democracy, took over in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">508</NUMEX> b.c. An aristocrat by birth, he introduced electoral <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">constituencies</ENAMEX> called demes and set up a sovereign citizens‚Äô <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">senate</ENAMEX>, whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> were chosen by lot. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">foundations</ENAMEX> of representation had truly been set. He also introduced an inspired system of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúostracism‚Äù</ENAMEX> under which any public <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">servant</ENAMEX> who was voted inept, tyrannical, or corrupt by the citizenry was banished from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten years</TIMEX>, though he was allowed to keep his property.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Persian</ENAMEX> Wars
At <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the fifth century</TIMEX> b.c., <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX> entered the period of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Persian</ENAMEX> Wars, as recorded in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Herodotus‚</ENAMEX>Äô great narrative history of the ancient world (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX>).
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Persian Empire‚</ENAMEX>Äôs far-flung lands included a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">settlements</ENAMEX> on the coast of what is now <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Turkey</ENAMEX>. When the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> attempted a revolt in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">499 b.c.</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> sent an expedition to aid their uprising. The revolt failed, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Persian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Darius</ENAMEX>, could not let such impudence go unpunished, and in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">490 b.c.</TIMEX> he confidently launched an invasion of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Attica</ENAMEX>. Although the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Persians‚Äô</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> and resources were vastly superior, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Darius</ENAMEX> hadn‚Äôt anticipated the amazing courage and battlefield skill of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greeks</ENAMEX>.
A fleet of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">around 600</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Persian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX> landed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marathon</ENAMEX> beach. Led by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Miltiades</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Athenians</ENAMEX> inflicted a crippling and humiliating defeat on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Persians</ENAMEX>. According to legend, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldier</ENAMEX> who ran from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marathon</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Athens‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇa</ENAMEX> distance of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">42 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">26 miles)‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</NUMEX>ÄÇto report the victory then died of exhaustion. His feat is still commemorated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Olympic</ENAMEX> race known as the marathon.
However, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Persians</ENAMEX> still held a grudge and when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Darius‚</ENAMEX>Äô <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Xerxes</ENAMEX>, re-invaded <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX> by land and sea in far greater strength <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten years later</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Greeks‚</ENAMEX>Äô defeat seemed inevitable. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A few hundred</TIMEX> heroic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> under <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Leonidas</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sparta</ENAMEX> delayed the enormous <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Persian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX> at the pass of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Thermopylae</ENAMEX> long enough for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Athenians</ENAMEX> to be evacuated to the island of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salamis</ENAMEX>. When he finally arrived, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xerxes</ENAMEX> plundered the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, burning down all the wooden structures on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acropolis</ENAMEX>.
The fleet of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">700</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Persian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX> then engaged the much smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Athenian</ENAMEX> naval force under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">command</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Themistocles</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Strait of Salamis</ENAMEX>, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Xerxes</ENAMEX> was in for a surprise. With the aid of brilliant tactics and newer <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">fleet</ENAMEX> trounced the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Persians</ENAMEX>, turning the tide in favor of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX>. The final, decisive battle of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Persian</ENAMEX> Wars took place in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">480 b.c.</TIMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Platae</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xerxes‚Äô</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> were soundly beaten. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> independence had been preserved again, and with it the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">foundations</ENAMEX> on which <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Western</ENAMEX> civilization has been built.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golden Age</ENAMEX>
For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">almost 50 years</TIMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Platae</ENAMEX>, peace reigned at home, and the victorious <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>-state entered its most brilliant era. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> was instrumental in bringing the disparate <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aegean</ENAMEX> and mainland <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> together, creating a ‚Äúleague of nations‚Äù, known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delian League</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">League</ENAMEX> was originally on the island of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delos</ENAMEX> but it was moved to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> itself in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">454 b.c.</TIMEX> The resources of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">treasury</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delian League</ENAMEX> were used‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇamong other things‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇto build the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parthenon</ENAMEX> and other monuments that still adorn the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acropolis</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>. 
The moving power behind this unrivaled time of greatness, which has come to be known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golden Age</ENAMEX>, was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pericles</ENAMEX>. This liberal-inclined aristocrat was, in effect, the supreme <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ruler</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> and its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30 years</TIMEX> until his death in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">429 b.c.</TIMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Great</ENAMEX> works of art, literature, science, and philosophy were produced by what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pericles</ENAMEX> referred to as the ‚Äúschool of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hellas</ENAMEX>.‚Äù Major names of the time included the dramatists <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Euripides</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sophocles</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">historian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herodotus</ENAMEX>, the philosopher <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Socrates</ENAMEX>, and the brilliant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zeno</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anaxagoras</ENAMEX>. The first literary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">salon</ENAMEX> in history was presided over by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aspasia, Pericles‚</ENAMEX>Äô <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mistress</ENAMEX>, a remarkable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> of intelligence and spirit.
During all this, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Athenian</ENAMEX> political system allowed the average <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizen</ENAMEX> a greater degree of participation in public life than ever before anywhere, and perhaps since. Of course, the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> (free adult <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX>) was small¬†‚Äî¬†probably not above <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">30,000¬†‚Äî¬</NUMEX>†while the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> as a whole, including <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">resident aliens</ENAMEX>, and slaves, might have been <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> times as great.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Slavery</ENAMEX> was common, justified on the grounds that democracy could not exist unless the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> were free to devote themselves to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">service</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. Most slaves in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prisoners</ENAMEX> of war.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Peloponnesian War</ENAMEX>
As <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> prospered, intense economic and ideological rivalry developed with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Athens‚Äô</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ally</ENAMEX> during the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Persian</ENAMEX> Wars, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sparta</ENAMEX>. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">431</NUMEX> b.c. the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Peloponnesian War</ENAMEX> broke out between them resulting in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27 years</TIMEX> of debilitating conflict, involving most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> world. Yet literature and art continued to flourish in spite of the incessant fighting, and during this time <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> built <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of the loveliest temples on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acropolis</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Erechtheion</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Athena Nike</ENAMEX> (see pages <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34 and 35</TIMEX>).
Finally, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sparta</ENAMEX>, with naval help from former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foe</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Persia</ENAMEX>, blockaded what was then the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hellespont</ENAMEX> (now the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dardanelles Strait</ENAMEX>), thus cutting off <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> from its crucial supply of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">grain</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starvation</ENAMEX> and heavy naval losses proved too much for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spartans</ENAMEX> claimed total victory. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sparta</ENAMEX> attempted to govern the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> through a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">council</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>, known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚ÄúThirty Tyrants</ENAMEX>,‚Äù who spent most of their time persecuting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponents</ENAMEX> and confiscating property. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">less than a year</TIMEX> they were driven from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sparta</ENAMEX>, embroiled in other conflicts, let <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> re-establish its maritime alliances without resistance.
But <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> was never to regain her earlier military or political influence. A new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">star</ENAMEX> rose in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">north‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthat</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philip II</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macedon</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander the Great</ENAMEX>. He advanced the far-sighted scheme of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">federation</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, which <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> resisted. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Athenians</ENAMEX> even urged the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Assembly</ENAMEX> to declare war on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Macedonian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX>. (The fiery <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philippics</ENAMEX>, speeches on the subject by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">master orator</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Demosthenes</ENAMEX>, rate among the finest of their kind.) Following defeat at the battle of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chaeronea</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">338 b.c.</TIMEX>, however, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Athenians</ENAMEX> accepted an alliance with other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> and even sent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philip</ENAMEX> a gold crown as a token of submission.
Yet culturally and intellectually <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> still remained unsurpassed through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fourth century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">b.c. Aristotle</ENAMEX>, one of the world‚Äôs greatest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">philosophers</ENAMEX>, held forth at his own <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lyceum; Menander</ENAMEX> wrote comic plays; Praxiteles sculpted scores of superb statues, including that of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hermes</ENAMEX>, one of the greatest <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> sculptures, now in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Olympia</ENAMEX>. This age, in fact, had an even more lasting influence than that exerted by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> during its great ‚ÄúClassical‚Äù <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fifth century</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Byzantium</ENAMEX> looked to it for inspiration, as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> did in the Medieval and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> periods.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman Rule</ENAMEX>
As the center of power shifted from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alexandria</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Macedonian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> occupied <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> twice¬†‚Äî¬†first in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">322</TIMEX> and then in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">262</NUMEX> b.c. However, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Macedonian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Empire</ENAMEX> did not survive long after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alexander‚</ENAMEX>Äôs death. Eventually, after a series of wars, it was dismantled by the far-ranging legions of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macedonia</ENAMEX> became just another <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX> (in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">146 b.c.</TIMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> not much more than a showplace <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> city, though its philosophy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> and orators kept attracting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Romans</ENAMEX> with political ambitions. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cicero</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Horace</ENAMEX> spent student <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Emperor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hadrian</ENAMEX> is said to have been initiated into the sacred mysteries of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Demeter</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eleusis</ENAMEX> (the most famous secret religious rites of ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX>; see page74).
Although generally treated well throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">some five centuries</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pax Romana</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> suffered severely on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> occasion. In <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">86 b.c.</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sulla</ENAMEX> sacked the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> in retribution for its unwise alliance with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mithridates</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">King of Pontus</ENAMEX> and bitter <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enemy</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX>. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Athenian</ENAMEX> treasures were carried off to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX>.
Athens‚Äô good fortune was that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Romans</ENAMEX> held <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> culture in such high esteem. Most notable was the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Emperor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hadrian</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">a.d. 76‚Äì138</ENAMEX>), who had a love of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Classical Greek</ENAMEX> architecture. Among other monuments, he erected his distinctive arched gate, and completed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Olympian Zeus</ENAMEX> on foundations laid by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peisistratus</ENAMEX> nearly <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven centuries earlier</TIMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">57</NUMEX>).
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Byzantine</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottoman Obscurity</ENAMEX>
When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman Emperor Constantine</ENAMEX> gave Christianity official sanction in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">326</TIMEX>, he looked for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚ÄúNew Rome‚Äù</ENAMEX> in the eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> hoped to be chosen but the title of new capital went to the former <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> colonial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Byzantium</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Constantinople</ENAMEX>), now <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Istanbul</ENAMEX>. Under <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Byzantine</ENAMEX> rule the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pericles</ENAMEX> sank into deep provincial obscurity. It merited only a few brief mentions in the history of the following <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christianity</ENAMEX> had taken early root in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX>, as a result of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Paul‚Äôs</ENAMEX> visit to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> somewhere around <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">a.d. Polytheism</ENAMEX>, however, persisted until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">529</TIMEX>, when an edict by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Emperor Justinian</ENAMEX> outlawed the last <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">‚Äúpagan‚Äù temples</ENAMEX> and closed the famous <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Athenian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> of philosophy. 
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">From the 12th</TIMEX> to 14th centuries <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> found itself governed by a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> nobles from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florence</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Catalonia</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Burgundy</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1456</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Attica</ENAMEX> were taken by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turks</ENAMEX> in their rampage across the disintegrating <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Byzantine Empire</ENAMEX>. The following <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four centuries</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottoman</ENAMEX> rule are known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Greece‚</ENAMEX>Äôs darkest age. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> was all but forgotten. Through this difficult period, only the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Orthodox Church</ENAMEX> could provide the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with any sense of identity and continuity. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Venetian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> attempted to wrest the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottoman</ENAMEX> control twice. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> time, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1687</TIMEX>, a shell hit a munitions <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Parthenon¬†‚Äî¬†badly</ENAMEX> damaging the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2,000-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX>.
Independence
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Athens</ENAMEX> dwindled ever further. When the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Byron</ENAMEX> visited it in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1809</TIMEX>, he found that what had once been the glittering center of the civilized world now had a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only about 5,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">souls</ENAMEX>.
As the nineteenth <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">century</TIMEX> commenced, a swell of nationalist fervor rose in the oppressed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX>. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25 March 1821</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Archbishop</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Germanos</ENAMEX> raised a new blue-and-white banner in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Patras</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peloponnese</ENAMEX> and declared independence, but it took <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11 years</TIMEX> and some formidable foreign help for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greeks</ENAMEX> to win their war against <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> rule. Athens changed hands more than once during the long struggle in which many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Scots</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Irish</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> fought alongside the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greeks</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Byron</ENAMEX>, who popularized the cause abroad, died at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Missolonghi</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1824</TIMEX> (of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, not from fighting).
On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27 October 1827</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> revolution was won, but the last <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turks</ENAMEX> weren‚Äôt evicted from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acropolis</ENAMEX> until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1833</TIMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">The following year</TIMEX>, the little <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> was declared the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> of modern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX>. 
Theoretically sovereign, the new state was an artificial creation¬†‚Äî¬†the result of pressure from other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> powers¬†‚Äî¬†and the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bavarian Prince Otto</ENAMEX> was installed as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX>. He was deposed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1862</TIMEX>, but during his reign <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> slowly returned to being a city again, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX> made considerable economic progress.
As a result of complex <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> diplomatic talks, a second adolescent came to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> throne in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1863</TIMEX>, the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Danish</ENAMEX> royal house <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gl√ºckburg</ENAMEX>. He took the name <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">George I</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King of the Hellenes</ENAMEX>, and remained in power for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50 years</TIMEX> until his assassination in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1913</TIMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">20th Century</ENAMEX>
The events that have shaped modern <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> history have been as interesting and chaotic as any in the Classical age. The dominant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">figure</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1910 and 1935</TIMEX> was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eleftherios Venizelos</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cretan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politician</ENAMEX> who was <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prime minister</ENAMEX> several times. He helped <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX> regain <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macedonia</ENAMEX> and many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aegean</ENAMEX> islands, including his <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">homeland</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crete</ENAMEX>. Venizelos was in power during the epic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> exchange with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Turkey</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1922</TIMEX>), under which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost one million</NUMEX> repatriated <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greeks</ENAMEX> flooded <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX>. The desperate, makeshift effort to accommodate them pushed back the city‚Äôs boundaries and accounts for the oldest of the suburban eyesores in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX>.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Between 1936 and 1940</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX> was under the military <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">dictatorship</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ioannis Metaxas</ENAMEX>, remembered for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">resounding √≥chi (‚Äúno‚Äù</ENAMEX>) he gave in reply to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mussolini‚</ENAMEX>Äôs ultimatum to surrender in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1940</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greeks</ENAMEX> commemorate <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28 October</TIMEX>, as a national holiday.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX> was invaded by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Nazi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 1941</TIMEX>; by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Germans</ENAMEX> controlled the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> placed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> suffered greatly, but the city‚Äôs monuments escaped serious damage. Unfortunately, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance movement</ENAMEX> formed during the war was so politically divided that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guerrillas</ENAMEX> expended almost as much energy fighting each other as against the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Germans</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 1944</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Allied</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> moved into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> and much of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX>, encountering little opposition from the retreating <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Germans</ENAMEX>.
The war left <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX> utterly devastated, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">factions</ENAMEX> squabbled ceaselessly in an attempt to gain political advantage. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Communist</ENAMEX> and royalist <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partisans</ENAMEX> moved steadily toward a military confrontation as the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, under the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Truman Doctrine</ENAMEX>, sent the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> economic aid. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Two years</TIMEX> of savage civil war ended in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late 1949</TIMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Communist</ENAMEX> defeat, but political instability persisted.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1967</TIMEX> a military <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">dictatorship</ENAMEX> seized power in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX>. During the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven-year</TIMEX> ‚Äúreign of the colonels,‚Äù as the succeeding <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> are known, political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> were dissolved, the press was censored, and left-wing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sympathizers</ENAMEX> were exiled, tortured, and imprisoned. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November 1973</TIMEX> a student protest at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens Polytechnic</ENAMEX> was brutally crushed. This action spelled the end of public tolerance of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>, which collapsed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eight months later</TIMEX> when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">junta</ENAMEX> attempted to overthrow the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cypriot</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Archbishop</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Makarios</ENAMEX>, provoking the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> invasion of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cyprus</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Constantine Karamanlis</ENAMEX>, the former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conservative premier</ENAMEX>, was recalled from exile in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> to restore democracy. The reforms that followed brought the abolition of the monarchy, and a new constitution for a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> was drawn up in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1975</TIMEX>.
With its entry into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Common Market</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1981</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece‚Äôs</ENAMEX> economic prospects strengthened. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">That same year</TIMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> socialist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> swept to victory under the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Andr√©as Papandr√©ou</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PASOK</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX>. Papandr√©ou espoused the desires of a post-war <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> to maintain peace and stability, and to secure a better future for their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX>, beleaguered by personal and financial scandals in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PASOK</ENAMEX> was defeated at the polls after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> rounds of voting, by the conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Democracy Party</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Constantine Mitsot√°kis</ENAMEX> became the new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prime minister</ENAMEX>. But the tenacious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Papandr√©ou</ENAMEX> was re-elected in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX>. He died in office in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>, and was succeeded by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prime Minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simitos</ENAMEX> who still holds the post.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1990s</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> was awarded the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Olympic Games</ENAMEX>. This, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Greece‚Äôs</ENAMEX> agreement to join the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Euro</ENAMEX> currency zone in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>, has resulted in a great deal of infrastructure and economic development, which has not been without its problems. Traffic in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> is still in gridlock, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stadium</ENAMEX> construction is behind schedule, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> economy has yet to meet the requirements for monetary union, but government rhetoric is upbeat as both deadlines approach. The history of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> reflects the ingenuity and vigor of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spirit</ENAMEX> that will, no doubt, meet whatever challenges the modern world has in store for it.
