Where to Go
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> is a small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> and eminently walkable, though if you only have a short time, take advantage of the tram system, which will transport you efficiently to all the most important attractions. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Circle Tram</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> links them all on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> route and runs at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10-minute</TIMEX> intervals throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> from the central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">station</ENAMEX>.
Perhaps the most disconcerting thing for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newcomer</ENAMEX> is how to find your way around. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">City center</ENAMEX> can seem at first like a maze of tiny <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canals</ENAMEX> with no overall plan; however, in some ways it works very much like the plan of a spiderâ€™s web and once you understand the structure of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> plan, it is relatively easy to get around. The central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">core</ENAMEX>, around <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Dam Square</ENAMEX>, is horseshoe-shaped, and consists of a series of wide streetsÂ â€”Â the main one is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Damrak/Rokin</ENAMEX> which cuts the centerÂ â€”Â and narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">alleys</ENAMEX>. It also has some of the oldest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">waterways</ENAMEX>, once so important for the delivery of goods from around the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> colonial world.
This area is ringed by a girdle of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canals</ENAMEX>, the major ones are called grachts, running outward in ever larger circles. Singel was once the outer barrier for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">medieval city</ENAMEX>, but as the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> expanded, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herengracht</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Gentlemanâ€™s Canal</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keizersgracht</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Emperorâ€™s Canal</ENAMEX>), and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prinsengracht</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Princesâ€™ Canal</ENAMEX>) enlarged the web. Incidentally, if you do feel lost or confused when strolling, remember that these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canals</ENAMEX> are set in alphabetical order: H, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX>, and P.
Small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> (straats) radiate out from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>, crossing the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canals</ENAMEX> by means of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridges</ENAMEX>, which are such a distinctive part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> landscape. To the north of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> centerÂ<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT"> â€”Â the IJ</ENAMEX> becomes the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IJsselmeer</ENAMEX> (a former route to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North Sea</ENAMEX>, now dammed); west of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IJ</ENAMEX> at this point is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NoordzeekanalÂ â€”Â Amsterdamâ€™s</ENAMEX> present-day route to the open sea.
We have divided the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> sections which are easy to follow on foot. We have started in the center of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, where you will be able to take your bearings, obtain whatever information you need from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VVV Tourist</ENAMEX> information <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>, and take a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canal</ENAMEX> boat tour. This is one of the most exciting ways to get an overview of historic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> and to see the true beauty of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central AmsterdamÂ â€”Â what</ENAMEX> was once the Medieval <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cityÂ</ENAMEX> â€”Â is very small indeed. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX> was the lifeblood of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> at that time and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX> would sail right into the heart of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amstelredamme</ENAMEX>, as it was then known. Today, only a few architectural gems are left to remind us of this <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">era</TIMEX>, but the tangle of narrow alleyways gives a feel of the hustle and bustle which must have accompanied the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX>.
The decision to locate the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Central Station</ENAMEX> on the site of the old harbor wall was the final death knell of maritime trade for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. It stopped large cargo <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX> from landing their catches and diminished the importance of the canal systems. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">station</ENAMEX>, opened in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1889</TIMEX>, dominates the view up Damrak. The impressive <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> was designed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PJH Cuypers</ENAMEX>, who was also responsible for the design of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rijksmuseum</ENAMEX>, and sits on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> artificial islands supported by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8,687</NUMEX> wooden piles.
Across the wide <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Stationplein</ENAMEX> in front of the entrance you will find a large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VVV Amsterdam Tourist Office</ENAMEX> where you can get information, buy transport tickets, make hotel reservations or book theater tickets. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> is housed in the rebuilt <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Noord Zuid Koffiehuis</ENAMEX> which was rebuilt in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1981</TIMEX> from the plans of the original. This was demolished when the metro was constructed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1911</TIMEX>. You will also find canal tour <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats moored</ENAMEX> here, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bicycles</ENAMEX> waiting for their riders.
Walk over the square towards the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> and, as you cross the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canal bridge</ENAMEX>, look to your left to see the distinctive spires of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sint Nicolaaskerk</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint Nicholas Church</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sint Nicolaas</ENAMEX> is an important saint for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX>, being <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patron</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> and of seafarers. This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catholic Church</ENAMEX> replaced many of the secret chapels which were built for worship during the period of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catholic</ENAMEX> persecution and was completed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1887</TIMEX>.
Once over the bridge you will find yourself on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Damrak</ENAMEX>. This wide <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">boulevard</ENAMEX> was formerly a major docking area for sailing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX>. On your left you will find the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">marina</ENAMEX> area full of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glass-</ENAMEX>topped tour <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX>. To your right, the street <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">side</ENAMEX> is lined with fast food cafÃ©s giving it a slightly down at the heels appearance.
Just beyond the tour <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX>, at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Damrak</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beurs van Berlage</ENAMEX>, the old stock exchange. Its refined modern lines were a revelation when it opened in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1903</TIMEX> and excited much debate in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. Unfortunately it didnâ€™t excite <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> quite as much and is now used as a concert and exhibition <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX> featuring everything from chamber music to modern art.
The warren of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> to the left of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beurs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>, is what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amsterdammers</ENAMEX> call <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oude Zijd</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Old Side</ENAMEX>, and this area constituted the old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">warehouse</ENAMEX> district in medieval times. The narrow alleyways are darker than in more modern parts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> appear even narrower and taller. Dominating the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> is the imposing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gothic</ENAMEX> basilica of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oude Kerk</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Old Church</ENAMEX>).
As its name suggests, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oude Kerk</ENAMEX> is the earliest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX>; work began on it at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the start of the 13th century</TIMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amstelredamme</ENAMEX> was only just starting as a trading <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>. Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the following three centuries</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> saw several extensions as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> grew, until it took on the interesting and rather over-busy shape it is todayÂ â€”Â with several chapels adding gables to the original structure. In its early life it was more than a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>, acting as a marketplace and hostel for the poor and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">needy</ENAMEX>.
Once inside, the sheer scale of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> is immediate and impressive. Commemorative tombstones cover the floor, including that of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saskia, Rembrandtâ</ENAMEX>€™s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>. The stained glass windows are also impressive. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> commemorates the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peace of Munster</ENAMEX> and shows a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> handing over the charter recognizing the independent <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State</ENAMEX>. Several of the windows show <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bible</ENAMEX> scenes on a majestic scale, but look also for the simple red door above which is written the advice â€œmarry in haste, repent at leisure.â€
The canalside <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oudezijds Voorburgwal</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oudezijds Achterburg</ENAMEX> southwest of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oude Kerk</ENAMEX> are home to the infamous <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Red Light District</ENAMEX>, known to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amsterdammers</ENAMEX> as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Walletjes</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â</NUMEX>€œlittle walls.â€ As with any large <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX>, prostitution was rife from the earliest times, and although the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Calvinist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Protestants</ENAMEX> tried to stamp it out it has thrived to the present day. What makes the situation different in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> in modern times is that the industry has been legitimized and regulated in an attempt to curb the most disturbing facets of exploitation and in order to address health concerns. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prostitutes</ENAMEX> are entitled to regular health checks and are expected to pay taxes on their earningsÂ â€”Â yet another example of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> peopleâ€™s trademark pragmatic approach when it comes to tackling societyâ€™s difficult issues. The area is safeÂ â€”Â except perhaps in the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early hours</TIMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">morningÂ â€”Â and</ENAMEX> filled with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX>. The tree-lined <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canals</ENAMEX> and old narrow iron <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridges</ENAMEX> are some of the prettiest in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prostitutes</ENAMEX> ply their trade behind relatively discreet windows, not on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>.
At ground level, seedy or amusing ( depending on your point of view) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> sell sex wares, attracting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> from all walks of life; but donâ€™t get too distracted, else youâ€™ll miss the rows of dainty gables, quirky wall plaques, and window boxes brimming with <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>, which give the whole area a cheery feel. Donâ€™t be surprised to find <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> living side by side with the brothels <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">hereÂ â€”Â itâ</ENAMEX>€™s all part of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> life.
At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> come alive with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bars</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clubs</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult</ENAMEX> shows. It is one of liveliest parts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> after dark. Just make sure that you stay on the busier and well-lit thoroughfares as you make your way back to your <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX>.
You will find several historical gems as you wander <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Walletjes</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Oudezijds VoorburgwalÂ â€”Â number 40Â â€”Â has</ENAMEX> a wonderful secret to share. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum Amstrelkring</ENAMEX> was a merchantâ€™s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX> bought by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catholic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jan Hartman</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1661</TIMEX>. Following the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alteration</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1578</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catholics</ENAMEX> were not permitted to practice their religion, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HartmanÂ â€”Â along</ENAMEX> with a number of other wealthy <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catholics</ENAMEX> of the timeÂ â€”Â had a secret chapel built, where his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> could worship. Although they were common at the time, this is now the only secret chapel left in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, and because of its location in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> is called <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">â€œOur Lord in the Atticâ€ or Onsâ€™ Lieve Heer op Solder</ENAMEX>. Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">its years</TIMEX> of use as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> surrounding <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> were added to create extra space, and several of the other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> are furnished in authentic <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th-century</TIMEX> style. It is a fascinating glimpse of a very difficult time in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdamâ€™s</ENAMEX> history, but itâ€™s not just a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> pieceÂ â€”Â the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> is still used for weddings.
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Southeast</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oude Kerk</ENAMEX> you will walk through the small <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Quarter</TIMEX> to reach <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Waag</ENAMEX>. This is one of the oldest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> and was opened in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1488</TIMEX> as a city gate, marking the eastern boundary of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> along the new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wall</ENAMEX> built after the disastrous fire in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1450s</TIMEX>. The numerous turrets and rounded <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> give it the look of a fairytale <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> but it has had a more colorful history. Public executions were held here in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16th century</TIMEX> with the condemned being kept in a small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ground floor</ENAMEX> before they met their fate. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">From the early 17th century</TIMEX> it became the weigh <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> (the name <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Waaggebouw</ENAMEX> means â€œweigh houseâ€) for cargoes entering or leaving the city down the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Geldersekade Canal</ENAMEX> to its north. The upper-floor <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> were taken by various tradesâ€™ guilds for their meetings, and for oneÂ â€”Â the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guild of SurgeonsÂ â€”Â it</ENAMEX> was used for practical medical research, including experiments with cadavers. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rembrandt</ENAMEX> created <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> canvasses for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guild of Surgeons</ENAMEX>, which have become <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of his most famous paintings. The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Anatomy Lesson of Dr Tulp and The Anatomy Lesson of Dr Diejman</ENAMEX> both show scenes from guild activities at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Waag</ENAMEX> and were hung here on their completion.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 19th century</TIMEX> the weigh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX> closed and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Waag</ENAMEX> had a number of less illustrious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tenants</ENAMEX>; it even spent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">some time</TIMEX> as a furniture <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX>. It now houses a cafÃ©/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX>, so you can have a refreshment and admire the impressive <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Gothic</ENAMEX> interior at the same time.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nieuwmarkt</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Market</ENAMEX>) surrounds the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Waag</ENAMEX> and it is home to several different types of market throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the week</TIMEX>. If you walk to the north side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Waag</ENAMEX> and look up the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gelderskade</ENAMEX> you will see a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> dominating the skyline. This is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schreierstoren</ENAMEX>, also part of the new city <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wall</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1480</TIMEX>. City <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX> are divided as to the reason for the towerâ€™s name. Some say it comes from the word schreien which means â€œweepingâ€ as it was a place where sailorsâ€™ weeping <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wives</ENAMEX> came to wave their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> off to sea. Other say that the name is a derivation of scherpe, which means <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">â€œsharpâ€Â â€”Â</ENAMEX> denoting the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">towers</ENAMEX> position on a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">90</NUMEX>-degree bend in the wall.
From <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Waag</ENAMEX> walk down <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sint Antoniesbreestraat</ENAMEX>, past modern <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment blocks</ENAMEX> built for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1970s</TIMEX>. On your right you will see the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ornate tower</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zuiderkerk</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South Church</ENAMEX>). This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> was the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> place of worship to be built following the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reformation</ENAMEX> and was begun in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1603</TIMEX>. Designed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hendrick de Keyser</ENAMEX>, its lines were much admired by Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher Wren</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">St. Paulâ€™s Cathedral</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX>. It was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de-consecrated in 1929</ENAMEX> and is now a community information <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>.
The end of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sint Antoniesbreestraat</ENAMEX> brings you to a tiny <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> with a wonderful view up the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Oudeschans Canal</ENAMEX> to your left. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Youâ€™ll</ENAMEX> find an old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>, now a small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cafÃ©</ENAMEX>, in the foreground and, in the background, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montelbaanstoren</ENAMEX>. Built as part of a new outer defensive wall in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1512</TIMEX> it originally had a flat <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">roofÂ â€”Â the ornate</ENAMEX> peak giving it such panache was added by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Keyser</ENAMEX> later in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1606</TIMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> it is used by the local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Water Authority</ENAMEX> as an office <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>.
After pausing to take a photograph, cross the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jodenbreestraat</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Jewish Broad Street</ENAMEX>) and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-story brick <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> with red shutters. This is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum Het Rembrandthuis</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rembrandtâ€™s House</ENAMEX>), and was home to the great <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1639 to1660</TIMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painter</ENAMEX> bought the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> as he rose in prestige and wealth. He created a studio on the top floor, where there was abundant natural light to illuminate his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>, and space for him to teach his numerous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pupils</ENAMEX>. He lived with his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> and infant son on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> floor. The whole <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX> was restored in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 1990s</TIMEX>, including the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">studio</ENAMEX> and the painterâ€™s kunstkamer or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cabinet</ENAMEX>, to re-create <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1600s</TIMEX> as faithfully as possible. Over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250</NUMEX> of the artistâ€™s etchings have been beautifully presented on the upper floors of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>. Unfortunately, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rembrandt</ENAMEX> was not able to live out his life in his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX>. His lack of financial acumen and love of expensive objects caused him to become bankrupt in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1656</TIMEX> and he had to sell all his <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">possessions</ENAMEX>, including the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1660</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Het Rembrandthuis</ENAMEX> has, as a neighbor, one of the most up to date attractions in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Holland Experience</ENAMEX> offers an audio-visual tour of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HollandÂ â€”Â its landscapes</ENAMEX> and traditional activities. Ride through colorful bulb fields or across the polders (low-lying lands reclaimed from the sea) and rivers from the comfort of your seat, and all in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 minutes</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Southeast</ENAMEX>
Running parallel to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jodenbreestraat</ENAMEX> on the left-hand side is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Waterlooplein</ENAMEX>, named after the famous battle and home to the famous flea market of the same name. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Every day</TIMEX> youâ€™ll find an eclectic mix of second-hand crockery, clothes, and electrical equipment on sale, along with <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">cotton</ENAMEX> clothes from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indonesia</ENAMEX>. The eastern end of the market square is dominated by the twin spires of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mozes</ENAMEX> en <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AÃ¤ronkerk</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moses</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aaron Church</ENAMEX>), a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catholic Church</ENAMEX> built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1840</TIMEX> on the site of a secret chapel. The Old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Testament figures</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moses</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aaron</ENAMEX> were found depicted on gable <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stones</ENAMEX> in the original <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> and were set into the wall of the new edifice. The fine <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">towers</ENAMEX> are actually wood rather than <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stone</ENAMEX>. They were painted to match the sandstone walls in a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX> restoration.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">WaterloopleinÂ â€”Â and</ENAMEX> its marketÂ â€”Â used to be much larger, but a massive building <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">project</ENAMEX> begun in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1980s</TIMEX> cut its size considerably. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Protesters</ENAMEX> deplored the loss of several old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canal houses</ENAMEX> fringing the square which constituted much of what was left of the old <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Jewish Quarter</TIMEX>. Nevertheless, the construction went ahead, and the result of this labor is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Muziek Theater</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stadhuis</ENAMEX>, the front faÃ§ade and entrance of which sits majestically on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Amstel River</ENAMEX>.
The attractive glass-fronted <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> was opened in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</TIMEX>. It is home to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Netherlands Opera and the National Ballet</ENAMEX> and also hosts a range of traveling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> in what is the largest auditorium in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Netherlands</ENAMEX>. Amsterdammers have christened this combination of town hall and theater the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œstoperaâ€</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">staduis</NUMEX>+opera).
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Amstel River</ENAMEX> has always been a major <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">artery</ENAMEX> through the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> and even <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> you will see a large amount of commercial traffic passing along the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">waterway</ENAMEX>. From the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terrace</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">walkway</ENAMEX> around the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Muziek Theater</ENAMEX> there are wonderful views of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canal houses</ENAMEX> bordering the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX> in front of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Muziek Theater</ENAMEX> provides a wonderful view down the river and is also one of the most interesting <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridges</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blauwbrug</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blue Bridge</ENAMEX>) is named after the color of the previous bridge which occupied the site. The present <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX>, dating from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1880</TIMEX>, is based on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pont Alexander III</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> and is ornamented with carvings of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX> and other maritime themes.
Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blauwbrug</ENAMEX> is the most ornate <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amsterdammers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> alike still have a soft spot for its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX> just a little way south down the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Amstel</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Magere Brug</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â</NUMEX>€œSkinny Bridge.â€ This white-painted wooden drawbridge is picture-perfect and one of the most enduring symbols of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. It is even prettier at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">dusk</TIMEX> when the lights on its arches and spars are switched on. There has been a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX> on this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">site</ENAMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1670s</TIMEX> but the present one was erected <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">as recently as 1969</TIMEX>.
Along the river on either side of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Magere Brug</ENAMEX> are a number of wonderful <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">barges</ENAMEX> moored on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX>. The huge craft which would once have carried heavy cargoes such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">grain</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coal</ENAMEX> now make surprisingly large, comfortable, quirky, and very expensive <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX>.
Beyond <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Magere Brug</ENAMEX> on the left <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Amstel</ENAMEX> you will see the faÃ§ade of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Theater CarrÃ©.</ENAMEX> Traditionally the site of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">CarrÃ© Circus</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CarrÃ</ENAMEX>© <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> built a wooden <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> on the site to house their shows. Later the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> was deemed to be a fire hazard and so they had this beautiful stone <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> designed for them, which opened for performances in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1887</TIMEX>. It now hosts many different types of performance, but a circus always appears here at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas time</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cross</ENAMEX> the river via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Magere Brug</ENAMEX> then travel <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">block</ENAMEX> north and take a left along the northern <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Herengracht Canal</ENAMEX>. Here you will get your first glimpse of the canal system which was built during <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amsterdamâ€™s Golden Age</ENAMEX> and revolutionized the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">its time</TIMEX>, probably the most sought after and expensive real estate in the world. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Herengracht</ENAMEX> particularly has many beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> which can really only be appreciated by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an afternoon</TIMEX> strolling by them (see box page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">66</NUMEX>). This part of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> is still mostly residential and many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> have been converted into <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartments</ENAMEX> for successful <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Amsterdammers</ENAMEX>. It is fascinating to peek inside at the ultra-modern interiors, which give a feel of the flair the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> seem to have for interior design.
At number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">605</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Herengracht, Museum Willet-Holthuysen</ENAMEX> gives you the opportunity to look behind the faÃ§ade of a genuine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golden Age</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>. It was completed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1690</TIMEX> and structurally has been altered very little since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that time</TIMEX>, although it has been changed cosmetically several times as fashions changed. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1855</TIMEX> it came into the possession of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Holthuysen</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pieter Holthuysen</ENAMEX> was a successful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glass</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> coal (which goes to prove that you didnâ€™t need to trade in exotic goods to become wealthy). After the death of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pieter</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> is bequeathed to their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louisa</ENAMEX> who later married <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abraham Willet</ENAMEX>. He had a love of art and was a founding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Royal Antiquarian SocietyÂ â€”Â a</ENAMEX> society whose aim was to promote national art and history. On her death in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1895</TIMEX> Louisa bequeathed the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and its contents to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> on condition that it would be opened as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>. This it duly did in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1896</TIMEX>. You will be able to examine in detail the furniture, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">porcelain</ENAMEX>, and numerous artworks collected by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>.
Travel further along <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Herengracht</ENAMEX> to the end of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">block</ENAMEX>. Here you will find one of the most fascinating views of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canal ring</ENAMEX>. From the bridge it is possible to see <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridges</ENAMEX> by looking up and down <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herengracht</ENAMEX> and ahead down the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">adjoining</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Reguliersgracht</ENAMEX> (this view is even better at water level, so take a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canal</ENAMEX> cruiseÂ â€”Â and your camera!). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reguliersgracht</ENAMEX> has some very pretty <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> and is quieter than the main <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> â€œgirdleâ€ <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canals</ENAMEX> built at this time.
The small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> here is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thorbeckeplein</ENAMEX> and you will see a suitably somber statue of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johan Rudolf Thorbecke</ENAMEX> who designed the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> constitution in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1848</TIMEX>. Wander through the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>, which hosts an art market on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sundays</TIMEX>, to reach <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rembrandtsplein</ENAMEX>, one of the cityâ€™s most vibrant social <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX>. Before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1878</TIMEX> this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> was called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Botermarkt</ENAMEX>, (a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">butter</ENAMEX> market was held here in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th century</TIMEX>) but the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> was renamed after the large statue of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rembrandt</ENAMEX> was sited here. One wonders what he would have made of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>, for since the statue was unveiled, it has attracted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">theaters</ENAMEX>, cinemas, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clubs</ENAMEX>, and show <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">halls</ENAMEX>, along with a plethora of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bars</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> and a curtain of vibrant neon signs all around the faÃ§ade. On a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">summer evening</TIMEX> it is one of the best places to sit with a drink and watch the world go by, and is within easy reach of a romantic walk along the canalsides.
Beyond the eastern end of Waterlooplein you will see the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Visserplein</ENAMEX>, busy with several <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> of traffic. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Head</ENAMEX> across the square to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Weesperstraat</ENAMEX> to find the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joods Historisch Museum</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jewish Historical Museum</ENAMEX>) which documents the history of the once large and influential <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> history dates back to the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late 16th century</TIMEX>, but was cut short by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Nazi</ENAMEX> occupation of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1940</TIMEX>. The systematic deportation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> to concentration <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camps</ENAMEX> destroyed the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> and after the war only a handful of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> forced to leave returned to their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>, which opened in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</TIMEX>, was created by the amalgamation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Ashkanazi synagogue buildings</ENAMEX>. The exhibitions reveal the history of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> but also explain the philosophies of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Judaism</ENAMEX>, and examine <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> identity in a broader sense.
Across the busy <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Weesperstraat</ENAMEX> are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> other reminders of the once-thriving <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX>. In a stark, exposed position near the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jonas DaniÃ«l Meijerplein</ENAMEX>, is the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Dokwerker Statue</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mari Andriessen</ENAMEX>. This figure of a true working <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> commemorates <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February 1941</TIMEX> when the dock <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> rose up in protest against the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Nazi</ENAMEX> deportation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX>. Behind the statue is the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Portugese-IsraÃ«litische Synagoge</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese Synagogue</ENAMEX>) which was inaugurated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1675</TIMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese Sephardic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> who settled in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. Its design is said to be based on that of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Solomonâ</ENAMEX>€™s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX>.
From <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jonas DaniÃ«l Meijerplein</ENAMEX> look southeast to the glass <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hortus Botanicus</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Botanical Gardens</ENAMEX>) easily seen just across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Nieuwe Herengracht</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canal</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cross</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canal</ENAMEX> by walking left along its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX> to the nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX>. Once across, you have entered the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Plantage</ENAMEX> area of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, once an area of parkland but which developed from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-19th century</TIMEX> into one of the first <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> suburbs.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Botanical Gardens</ENAMEX> have a long and illustrious history. They began as a small medicinal garden in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1682</TIMEX>, but soon became the depository for many of the new plant species brought from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golden Age</ENAMEX> and were responsible for developing each genus for cultivation, propagation and commercial exploitation. The distinctive glass <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> were added in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1912</TIMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> the gardens have one of the largest collections in the world.
A <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two-minute</TIMEX> walk down <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Plantage Middenlaan</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plantage Middle Road</ENAMEX>) leads you to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Artis</ENAMEX>, a fascinating complex of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">zoo</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">aquarium</ENAMEX>, planetarium, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Geological Museum</ENAMEX> which aims to increase your knowledge of the physical world. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">zoo</ENAMEX> was one of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> when it opened its doors in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1838</TIMEX>, and it has continued as a groundbreaking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX>, now acting as a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> for efforts to save several endangered <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>.
Many of the old and confined Victorian <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">enclosures</ENAMEX> where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> were kept have been redeveloped in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1990s</TIMEX> to create more fitting environments for their majestic and healthy-looking <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Planetarium</ENAMEX> and other areas of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Artis</ENAMEX> offer fun ways to learn about the world around us and are entertaining for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> alike.
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Southeast</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Artis</ENAMEX>, across <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canals</ENAMEX> and busy <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX>, is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oosterpark</ENAMEX>, an open green area with a lake and play areas (we would suggest taking a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tramÂ â€”Â numbers 9</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">14Â â€”Â rather</ENAMEX> than walking here from the city <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>). In the northern corner of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tropenmuseum</ENAMEX>, once the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">home</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dutch Colonial Institute</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> itself was built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1926</TIMEX> and built especially to house the instituteâ€™s collection of artifacts from the tropics.<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> the aim of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> is to improve our knowledge of the worldâ€™s tropical areas, and promotes an understanding of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peoples</ENAMEX> in these developing parts of the world. A vast collection of artifacts from the former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dutch East Indies</ENAMEX> (now <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indonesia</ENAMEX>) was the starting point for the displays, which range from tribal masks to tools and utensils in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> use. Recreations of a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bombay</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> souk, among other locales, bring home the reality of life in these very different <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">societies</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> also has a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kindermuseum</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Childrenâ€™s Museum</ENAMEX>) offering <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6â€“12 year olds</TIMEX> a chance to explore the collection and interact with the exhibits. Special guides lead <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> through the artifacts and explain their context. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kindermuseum</ENAMEX> must be booked in advance and at present the tours are in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> only.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North of Artis</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Entrepotdok</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th century</TIMEX> this was the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">warehouse</ENAMEX> region of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, and its carefully designed <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canals</ENAMEX> were one of the busiest port <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">areas</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">warehouses</ENAMEX> fell into disrepair in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 20th century</TIMEX>, and lay empty for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many years</TIMEX> before they became a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s and 1970s</TIMEX> squatter revolution which overtook the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1980s</TIMEX> the area has been totally renovated, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">warehouses</ENAMEX> gutted to create modern spacious <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">housing</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bars</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> without changing the basic design of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>.
Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhabitants</ENAMEX> get a birdâ€™s eye view of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Artis zooÂ â€”Â imagine</ENAMEX> looking out of your <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX> window on a rainy <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> day and seeing a small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">herd</ENAMEX> of grazing zebra.
Walk north through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Entrepodok</ENAMEX> and you will reach the main route of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prinse Henrikkade</ENAMEX> which runs along the northern edge of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> (this would lead you back to central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">station</ENAMEX> if you turned left). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cross</ENAMEX> the bridge of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Nieuwe Vaart</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canal</ENAMEX> and walk towards a large <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square building</ENAMEX> with a masted sail <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ship</ENAMEX> docked outside. This is The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scheepvaartmuseum</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The National Maritime Museum</ENAMEX>). As you cross the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX>, look left for a glimpse of the only windmill left in the cityâ€™s central area. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">De Gooyer</ENAMEX> windmill was built in the early part of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 18th century</TIMEX> to grind <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">corn</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building housing</ENAMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scheepvaartmuseum</ENAMEX> was built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1656</TIMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">navy</ENAMEX>. Its strong walls safeguarded a vast <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">arsenal</ENAMEX> used to protect <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">interests</ENAMEX> around the known world. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> its extensive exhibits document the long and illustrious history of maritime achievement by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX>, with paintings, maps, and maritime models explaining the part that shipsÂ â€”Â and particularly the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">VOCÂ â€”Â played</ENAMEX> in the growth of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th century</TIMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dutch Royal</ENAMEX> barge (last used in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1962</TIMEX>) is also kept in air-conditioned splendor, but perhaps pride of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">placeÂ â€”Â and</ENAMEX> certainly what brings <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">seafaring</ENAMEX> to lifeÂ â€”Â is the re-creation of a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East India</ENAMEX> ship The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> which sits in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dock</ENAMEX> outside. She is the life-size replica of a real ship completed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1748</TIMEX>, but more than this, The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> has a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â€œpress-gangedâ</NUMEX>€ <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crew</ENAMEX> to man her. As you explore her decks, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">captain</ENAMEX> will illustrate his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">course</ENAMEX> with charts of the time, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> will explain his rather primitive treatments, and the ordinary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">seamen</ENAMEX> will be happy to sing you a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> sea shanty.
Next to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>, and unmistakable by its modern shape and huge green outer walls, is the newMetropolis science and technology <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">center</ENAMEX>. Opened in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> was created to bring the latest science and technology literally into the hands of the lay <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>, whatever their age. Even the location of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> is a technological marvel. It sits high above the entrance to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IJ</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tunnel</ENAMEX>, which takes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> of traffic under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IJ</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">waterway</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amsterdamâ</ENAMEX>€™s northern suburbs and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">north Holland</ENAMEX> beyond. Inside the center you can try your hand at playing the stock exchange by computer, change the wheel on a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>, or look at the cells of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> through a microscope. There are hands-on experiments for everyone from young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>, focusing on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> linked <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">themesÂ â€”Â Energy</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Humanity, Interactivity, Science, and Technology</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southwest</ENAMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">southwest</ENAMEX> section takes on a fan shape from the center of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, widening as it travels out and taking in the major art <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>.
Our starting point is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Muntplein</ENAMEX>, at the junction of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Amstel</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Singel</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canals</ENAMEX>.
Although only a small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>, and cut by so many tramlines that it is difficult to know which way to look, it has a very beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">towerÂ â€”Â Muntorren</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mint Tower</ENAMEX>). Originally a medieval gate guarding the entrance to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, it was damaged by fire in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1619</TIMEX>, and the clock <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> was added by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Keyser</ENAMEX> during the renovations of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1620</TIMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1699</TIMEX> the carillon was installed and this still fills the air with its regular bell rounds. During the war with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1672</TIMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> had its supply of money cut off, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> was transformed for a short time into the city <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mint</ENAMEX>, and the name has remained since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that time</TIMEX>.
In the shadow of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX>, and floating on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Singel</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canal</ENAMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">medieval protective moat</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>) is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bloemenmarkt</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Flower</ENAMEX> market). The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> market has been held for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX>, when the flower <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sellers</ENAMEX> would arrive by <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canal</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> laden with blooms. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stalls</ENAMEX> still float on the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> but are permanently attached to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canal wall</ENAMEX>. The blooms they sell bring a splash of color to even the dullest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> day.
Stroll along the market until you reach <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Konigsplein</ENAMEX> and take a left down <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leidsestraat</ENAMEX>. This is a major shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> and one of the busiest because it links one of the largest squares in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> to the central area.
Stop at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metz and Co.</ENAMEX> department store, which sits on the corner of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Keizersgracht</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leidsegracht</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the oldest in town, it offers good views of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> from the cafÃ© on the top floor.
At the end of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leidsestraat</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leidseplein</ENAMEX>, probably the busiest in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> and a major focus for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œR&Râ€</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cafÃ©s</ENAMEX> spill out onto the square which strangely has no real point of focus, unlike <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rembrandtsplein</ENAMEX>. Look out for a small grassy area, with sculptures of life-size iguanas and other large lizards. The narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> leading off the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> are filled with cinemas, concert <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">halls</ENAMEX>, and intimate live venues. There is also a busy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VVV Amsterdam Tourist Office</ENAMEX>.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> youâ€™ll find several different street <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">performers</ENAMEX> vying for your <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">guilders</NUMEX>. Itâ€™s a place where talented music <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> play classical pieces, or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">musicians</ENAMEX> from around the world play their traditional tunes. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> an ice <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rink</ENAMEX> fills the space so you can enjoy a skating session. Whatever the time of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>, as the sun sets, the neon lights are switched on and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> flock to enjoy the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">nightclubs</ENAMEX> which keeps the square buzzing until <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the early hours of the morning</TIMEX>.
On the western <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">side</ENAMEX> of Leidseplein you will find the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stadsschouwburg</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Municipal Theater</ENAMEX>) which was built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1894</TIMEX>. Once the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">premier</ENAMEX> opera <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, it has been usurped by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Muziek Theater</ENAMEX>, but still hosts regular performances of visiting and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>, being home to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toneelgroep</ENAMEX> drama <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. Next door sits the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Hotel</ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Art Nouveau treasure</ENAMEX> and national monument completed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1902</TIMEX>. If you are not staying at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX> be sure to visit the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">CafÃ© Americain</ENAMEX> on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> floor to enjoy the sumptuous surroundings, and perhaps share a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX> with a celebrity or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>.
Turn left once through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leidseplein</ENAMEX> and across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Singelgracht</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canal</ENAMEX>, and you will find the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam Casino</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lido</ENAMEX> on your left. On your right, across <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Stadhouderskade</ENAMEX>, is a narrow gate leading to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vondelpark</ENAMEX>. This <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>, founded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1865</TIMEX>, has been called â€œthe lungs of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amsterdamâ€</ENAMEX> and was founded after a number of philanthropic city <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fathers</ENAMEX> decided that there was a need for a genteel recreation area for the cityâ€™s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, many of whom lived in overcrowded slums. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> was named after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Netherlandsâ</ENAMEX>€™ <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">premier poet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joost van den Vondel</ENAMEX> and designed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> fashion of the times. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> its <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">46 hectares</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">120 acres</NUMEX>) have grazing farm <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, flocks of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">parakeets</ENAMEX>, jogging <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tracks</ENAMEX>, and cycle paths. It is the perfect place for a picnic on a summerâ€™s day. The large <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pavilion</ENAMEX>, which opened in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1881</TIMEX>, was restored and refurbished in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX> and reopened as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nederlands Filmmuseum</ENAMEX>. It now shows <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than 1000</TIMEX> films each year including many outdoor screenings and other artistic performances in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX>.
Only <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five minutes</TIMEX> to the south of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leidseplein</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">quarter</TIMEX>, for many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> the raison dâ€™Ãªtre for their visit to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX>. Here, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of the most important art collections in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> sit side by side, allowing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> to walk from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to the next in a matter of moments. Although all very different in appearance, they are brought together by an open space which has recently been redesigned and replanted to accent the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> is called, not surprisingly, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Museumplein</ENAMEX>.
The Rijksmuseum
Pride of place must go to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rijksmuseum</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The National Art Gallery</ENAMEX>) with arguably the greatest collection of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> art in the world. The collection is housed in a magnificent Victorian <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Gothic building</ENAMEX>, especially designed for it by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">P. J. H. Cuypers</ENAMEX>, which was opened in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1885</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> can be a confusing maze of connecting <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">roomsÂ â€”Â additions</ENAMEX> were completed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1898</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1919Â â€”Â</NUMEX> so it pays to sit down for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a few minutes</TIMEX> to study the very comprehensive map, which accompanies your ticket. A multimedia interactive study area also allows you to review the vast collection on a screen, pinpoint works which you want to see, and print out further details of each piece. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>, called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ARIA</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam Rijksmuseum InterActief</ENAMEX>), is located in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">225</TIMEX>, behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Night Watch</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>. You can also take advantage of an audio CD tour to give you background detail as you explore.
The collection is varied but most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> come to see the works of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">masters</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dutch</ENAMEX> painting of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 15th</TIMEX> to 17th <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX> are to be found in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">201 to 236</TIMEX> on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX>. Among the collection are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> works by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rembrandt</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Nightwatch</ENAMEX>, properly entitled <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Company of Captain Frans Banning Cocq</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lieutenant</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Willem van Ruytenburch</ENAMEX>. The work, which was commissioned by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> for its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">barracks</ENAMEX>, is remarkable for its lack of formality and very different from the accepted style of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johannes Vermeer</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1632â€“1675</ENAMEX>) is also well-represented, and his effective use of light can be clearly seen in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Kitchen Maid</ENAMEX>, painted in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1660</TIMEX>, which is one of the galleryâ€™s best-loved pieces. There are paintings by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frans Hals</ENAMEX>, the founding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Dutch School</ENAMEX>, along with a collection of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> influenced or schooled by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">masters</ENAMEX>. Rembrandt was a prolific <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pupils</ENAMEX> produced work so similar to his that in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later years</TIMEX> many were initially mistaken for the great artistâ€™s work.
Look out also for painting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A17</TIMEX>, by a lesser-known <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gerrit Adriaensz Berckheyde</ENAMEX>, which depicts <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Herengracht</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1672</TIMEX> when its grand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> were just being completed. The view has no <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> and shows the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">â€œGentlemanâ€™s Canalâ</ENAMEX>€ in pristine condition.
Works of later <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> include a number by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">The Hague</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">School</ENAMEX>, which rose to fame in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 1800s</TIMEX> and whose best-known <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jan van Huysum</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> also has a collection of work by non-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> including <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rubens</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tintoretto</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Greco</ENAMEX> and impressive displays of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">porcelain</ENAMEX>, furniture, sculpture, and decorative arts including a large section of Asiatic art in the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">South Wing</ENAMEX>. It also has a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX> for those who feel the need to take a break in the middle of their tour.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Van Gogh Museum</ENAMEX>
Behind the ornate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gothic Rijksmuseum</ENAMEX> are the ultra-modern lines of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Van Gogh Museum</ENAMEX>, devoted to the work of this modern <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">master</ENAMEX>. The main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> was designed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gerrit Reitveld</ENAMEX> and opened in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1973</TIMEX>, however a large freestanding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX> of circular design by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kisho Kurokawa</ENAMEX> was completed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>, to host temporary exhibitions.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum houses</ENAMEX> over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> paintings and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> drawings by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">artistÂ â€”Â one</ENAMEX> of the most infamous of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">19th</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">centuryÂ â€”Â and</ENAMEX> it constitutes the greatest collection of his work, covering all periods of his troubled career. The bulk of the collection was brought together by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Theo Van Gogh</ENAMEX>, who also kept <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 800</NUMEX> letters written by his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX>, which, when read in conjunction with viewing the paintings, bring life and context to the works themselves.
Vincentâ€™s working life was short but frenetic, interspersed with periods of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">manic depression</ENAMEX>, and his paintings reflect his moods. His <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1885</TIMEX> work <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Potato Eaters</ENAMEX> shows the hard lives endured by the rural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poor</ENAMEX> among whom <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Van Gogh</ENAMEX> lived at this time. Contrast this with the superb vibrant colors of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Bedroom in Arles and Vase with Sunflowers</ENAMEX>, both painted after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vincent</ENAMEX> moved to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Provence</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1888</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Van Gogh</ENAMEX> is renowned for his reinterpretation of the works of other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> has prime examples of works based on paintings by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rembrandt, Delacroix</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Millet</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stedelijk Museum</ENAMEX>
Next door to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Van Gogh Museum</ENAMEX> is another, whose stately exterior presents a very different impression to its contents. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stedelijk Museum</ENAMEX> was finished in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1895</TIMEX>. The faÃ§ade is neolassical with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">figures</ENAMEX> of famous <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Keyser</ENAMEX> gaze down on the passing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowds</ENAMEX>. It was built specifically to house the private art collection of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sophia de Bruyn</ENAMEX>, who then bequeathed it to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1890</TIMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1938</TIMEX> it became the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum of Modern Art</ENAMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> it displays a permanent range of work by celebrated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> and numerous temporary exhibitions which reflect the cutting edge in visual art genres such as photography and video. Look particularly for works by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marc Chagall</ENAMEX>, including his self <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">portrait Portrait of the Artist with Seven Fingers, Pregnant Woman, and Man with Violin</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Picasso</ENAMEX> is represented by several works, along with paintings by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monet</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CÃ©zanne</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matisse</ENAMEX>. There is also a comprehensive examination of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">De Stijl</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Style</ENAMEX>) art and design <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">movement</ENAMEX>, which swept through the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Netherlands</ENAMEX> in the post-WWI period. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gerrit Reitveld</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designer</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Van Gogh Museum</ENAMEX>, has several designs in the collection, and the work of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Piet Mondrian</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> modernist, are some of the most popular in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>.
If you feel exhausted after your â€œmuseum-fest,â€ then the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> around the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museumplein</ENAMEX> offer some exciting retail therapy. Walk across <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paulus Potterstraat</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Van Gogh Museum</ENAMEX> and you will find <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Coster Diamonds</ENAMEX>, one of the oldest â€œhousesâ€ in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, where you can watch <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diamonds</ENAMEX> being polished and maybe buy <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a carat</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Van Baerlstraat</ENAMEX>, bordering the west side of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museumplein</ENAMEX>, is the haute couture area of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. For further culture of a musical nature the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Concertgebouw</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Van Bearlstraat</ENAMEX> is home to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">orchestra</ENAMEX> of the same name. The main auditorium is considered to have almost perfect acoustics even though the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designer</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Van Gendt</ENAMEX>, had no experience in this specialized area.
If you want to stroll back to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> after your visit to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX> then walk through the open <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX> which cuts through the center of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rijksmuseum</ENAMEX>, across <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Stadouderskade</ENAMEX> and on to the narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nieuwe Speigalstraat</ENAMEX>. This <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">center</ENAMEX> of antique and art <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">galleries</ENAMEX> has some wonderful windows to gaze into. Prices are said to be on the high side, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX> are some of the most experienced in the world and they are sure to give you good advice.
Walk north along the whole length of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nieuwe Speigalstraat</ENAMEX> and you will eventually reach <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Herengracht</ENAMEX> at its most spectacular point. When it was first dug, and the lots of land sold, it was soon realized that this section of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canal</ENAMEX> (between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vijzelstraat</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leidsestraat</ENAMEX>) would have the largest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> inhabited by the richest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. For this reason it has become known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">â€œGolden Bend</ENAMEX>.â€ Many of these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> now house <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX> and financial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest</ENAMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">northwest</ENAMEX> section abuts the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>, commencing at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kalverstraat</ENAMEX>, the rather brash, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œhappeningâ€</ENAMEX> shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> which cuts the center of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> from north to south. When you reach <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spui</ENAMEX> take a left into a small squareÂ â€”Â on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Fridays</TIMEX> you will find a book market here. On the north side of the square you will see a small alleyway which seems to lead between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>. This is the entrance to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Begijnhof</ENAMEX>, a haven of peace in the center of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>.
The cluster of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> around a small central <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> was set aside in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1346</TIMEX> for the benefit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beguines</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of a lay <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catholic</ENAMEX> sisterhood. They lived simple lives and in return for their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lodgings undertook</ENAMEX> to care for the sick and educate the poor. Although nothing remains of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 14th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>, number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</NUMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Het Houten Huis, Amsterdamâ</ENAMEX>€™s oldest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>, dating from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1488</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catholic</ENAMEX> chapel dates from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1680</TIMEX> when it was built in a style to disguise its purpose. The stained glass windows depict the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miracle</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX>. However, in the center of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX> is an earlier <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> now called the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">English Presbyterian Church</ENAMEX>. It was rented out to <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Scottish</ENAMEX> worshippers in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1607</TIMEX> following the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alteration</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pilgrim</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Fathers worshipped</ENAMEX> here before they set off on their long journey to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New World</ENAMEX> (they came to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX> before they set sail for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New World</ENAMEX>).
The last <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beguine</ENAMEX> died <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">as recently as 1971 and today</TIMEX>, although the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> are still offered only to single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> faith, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> are not expected to undertake lay work.
Behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Begijnhof</ENAMEX> is the old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Convent of St. Lucian</ENAMEX>, which became the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> orphanage after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alteration</ENAMEX>, although it was only open to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">well-to-do orphans</ENAMEX>; the poor had to fend for themselves. Extended several times, including a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX> designed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Keyser</ENAMEX>, it was opened as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amsterdam Historical Museum</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1975</TIMEX> and its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> reveal the details of the development of this fascinating <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. Youâ€™ll see plans, maps, and paintings depicting the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canals</ENAMEX> as they were when just completed. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golden Age</ENAMEX> is brought to life (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5â€“15</TIMEX>) but there is also an interesting section on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Nazi</ENAMEX> occupation, and efforts to protect and preserve the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. Tiny details, such as the relief above the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kalverstraat</ENAMEX> entrance which asks <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to support the upkeep of the orphanage, also point to the museumâ€™s original purpose.
Once out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>, walk north. Take <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kalverstraat</ENAMEX>, or if you find it a little too busy for comfort, take <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rokin</ENAMEX> which runs parallel to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kalverstraat</ENAMEX> to the right. This wide <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> was once also a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canal</ENAMEX>, which was drained and filled in to allow better access for modern forms of transport. On the far side of the canal you will see the elegant <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Georgian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">faÃ</ENAMEX>§ade of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Allard Pierson Museum</ENAMEX>, the archaeological collection for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. Another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> strolling will bring you to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Dam Square</ENAMEX> (simply called <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Dam</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amsterdammers</ENAMEX>), the symbolic heart of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dam</ENAMEX> is a wide cobbled <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>, usually filled with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and pigeons, and dominated by the ornate faÃ§ade of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Koninklijk Paleis</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Palace</ENAMEX>) which dates from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1655</TIMEX>. It was originally built as the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Town Hall</ENAMEX>, facing the landing wharfs of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Damrak</ENAMEX>, which would at that time have been busy with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX>. The classical design, by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacob van Campen</ENAMEX> gives some indication of the confidence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Golden AgeÂ â€”Â a</ENAMEX> statue of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atlas</ENAMEX> carrying the world on his shoulders sits astride the rear of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>, and in the sumptuous interior, only the best <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">materials</ENAMEX> were used. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis Bonaparte</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Napoleon</ENAMEX>, became <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holland</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1806</TIMEX>, he demanded a palace suitable for his position and requisitioned the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Town Hall</ENAMEX>. He furnished it with the finest pieces of the time and left them all behind <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">only four years later</TIMEX> when he was forced out of power. It has remained a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Palace</ENAMEX> ever since but it is not a royal residence Ã  la <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Buckingham Palace</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX>, and is only used for ceremonial occasions. It is possible to visit the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> if there are no official activities taking place.
Beside the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Palace</ENAMEX> sits <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nieuwe Kerk</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Church</ENAMEX>) built before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Palace</ENAMEX>, but not the oldest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, hence its name. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> has suffered several catastrophic fires during its history and was stripped of all its treasures during the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alteration</ENAMEX>. The pulpit is interesting since it is beautiful but extremely ornate for a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Protestant</ENAMEX> place of worship.
Across <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Dam Square</ENAMEX> is the stark, white <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Monument</ENAMEX>, paid for by public subscription after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WWII</ENAMEX> and erected in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1956</TIMEX>. It commemorates the role of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> in the war.
On <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">Damâ€™s</ENAMEX> south side you will find <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madame Tussauds</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> waxworks. Not only will you be able to see figures of your favorite music and film <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stars</ENAMEX> here, along with a whole panorama which recreates <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amsterdamâ€™s Golden Age</ENAMEX>, but also the windows on the upper floors give excellent views over the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>.
Make your way behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Palace</ENAMEX> to Raadhuisstraat which will lead to the northern <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canal ring</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heren, Keizers</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prinsen</ENAMEX> grachts). Immediately behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Magna Plaza</ENAMEX>, originally the main <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> Office <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1899</TIMEX> in an almost exaggerated <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gothic</ENAMEX> style. It was considered far too ornate for a civil <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">service</ENAMEX> when it was originally opened but was refurbishedÂ â€”Â and the interior sympathetically adaptedÂ â€”Â in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX> to house the cityâ€™s only shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mall</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Raadhuisstaat</ENAMEX> is the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">thoroughfare</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">northwestern canal ring</ENAMEX> and is busy with trams, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">buses</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX>. It will take you quickly to the main attractions of the area but it is not the prettiest or quietest route. Wandering the smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">alleys</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> to the north and south of it will be much more fulfilling (the details of the highlights of each of the major <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canals</ENAMEX> can be seen on page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">66</NUMEX>). Follow <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Raadhuisstraat</ENAMEX> until you reach the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Westerkerk</ENAMEX>, set in its own <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> on the left and overlooking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prinsengracht</ENAMEX>. This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> was designed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Keyser</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1619</TIMEX> and was one of his last commissions. It is said to be the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">burial place</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rembrandt</ENAMEX>, but unfortunately no one knows knows the exact location. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pupils</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gerard de Lairesse</ENAMEX> painted the organ panels, which were added in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1686</TIMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> you can climb the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX>, the tallest in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">83m</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">273 ft</ENAMEX>), for incomparable views of the surrounding rooftops. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crown</ENAMEX> on top of the bell <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> is a replica of the crown presented to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1489</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maximilian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">I</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holy Roman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Emperor</ENAMEX>.
Turn left beyond the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Prinsengracht 263</NUMEX>, just an ordinary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canal house</ENAMEX>-cum-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> but made famous worldwide by what happened here in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WWII</ENAMEX>. This is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anne Frank Huis</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anne Frank House</ENAMEX>), where during the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Nazi</ENAMEX> occupation of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> this young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX>, her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, and a small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of others hid for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</TIMEX> in an attempt to avoid capture and deportation. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anne</ENAMEX> wrote a diary which paints a clear and terrifying picture of the life the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> lived. It comes to an eerie stop <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">only a few days</TIMEX> before the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> was discovered and sent to concentration <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camps</ENAMEX>. Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in hiding, only <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Anneâ€™s father survivedÂ â€”Â Anne</ENAMEX> died of typhus <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">only weeks</TIMEX> before the war endedÂ<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE"> â€”Â and</ENAMEX> after the war, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1947</TIMEX>, he published the diary. It became not only an international bestseller but also a symbol for the oppression of humankind.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>, built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1635</TIMEX>, has been left much as it was at the time that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anne</ENAMEX> hid here. It opened as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1960</TIMEX>. The secret <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms upstairs</ENAMEX>, where the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> spent <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the daylight hours</TIMEX>, are stark and bleak. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> of magazine pin-ups still adorn one wall. The wooden <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bookcase</ENAMEX>, which hid the doorway to their refuge, is still in situ, propped open for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> to climb the few stairs to their home.
Downstairs were the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">warehouses</ENAMEX> of Mr <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frankâ</ENAMEX>€™s business, which have been recreated in a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">multimillion dollar</NUMEX> development opened in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 1999</TIMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> adjacent <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> have been bought by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> and refurbished, adding much-needed exhibition and audio-visual space, without compromising number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">263</NUMEX> itself. Youâ€™ll see videos of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anneâ€™s</ENAMEX> story and of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> under occupation along with photographs and artifacts of the time. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anne Frank Huis</ENAMEX> also acts as an education <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">center</ENAMEX> and resource for political and philosophical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> fighting oppression in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the present day</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cross Prinsengracht</ENAMEX> to reach the area of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jordaan</ENAMEX>. Built as housing for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> and artisans in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 17th century</TIMEX> it extends roughly from the far <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prinsengracht</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lijnbaansgracht</ENAMEX>, and from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brouwersgracht</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brewers Canal</ENAMEX>) in the north down to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leidseplein</ENAMEX>. Many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> were named after fragrant <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> but this was not the prettiest or sweetest smelling area of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> in its heyday. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Overcrowding</ENAMEX> was rife, and with industries such as fabric-dyeing carried out on the ground floors, it was an unsanitary place to live. Its name is said to derive from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">French</ENAMEX> word jardin since a large contingent of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Huguenots</ENAMEX> came to live here to escape political persecution in their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">homeland</ENAMEX>. Today, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jordaan</ENAMEX> has been revived and it has become a fashionable residential area. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Youâ€™ll</ENAMEX> find many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, and interesting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boutiques</ENAMEX> in the area. Itâ€™s a good place to browse for an unusual souvenir of your trip.
The outskirts of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> is a large <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> despite its small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> and the sprawling suburbs hold some attractions which you may find interesting.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aviodome</ENAMEX> (take the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Schiphol Airport</ENAMEX>)
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aviodome</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Aeronautical Museum</ENAMEX> and is housed in a giant <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">aluminium dome</ENAMEX> in the grounds of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Schiphol Airport</ENAMEX>. It leads the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitor</ENAMEX> through the history of flight, from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montgolfier Brothers</ENAMEX> and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">balloons</ENAMEX> to the space race. Perhaps the most important part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> relates the history of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KLM</ENAMEX> the national <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">airline</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Netherlands</ENAMEX>, which is one of the oldest airline <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> in the world.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam Bos</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bus</ENAMEX> numbers <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">170, 171, 172</ENAMEX>)
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Netherlands</ENAMEX> suffered economic stagnation during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 1920s and 1930s</TIMEX>, as did most other developed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the methods used to relieve the problems of unemployment was to organize large community projects which were funded by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of these was <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam Bos</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amsterdam Wood</ENAMEX>, which created the largest recreation area in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1967</TIMEX> it was enlarged to its present <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">800 hectares</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2,000 acres</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam Bos</ENAMEX> is more than a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>. It has meadows, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">woodland</ENAMEX>, and a huge lake for rowing, sailing, and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hourly</TIMEX> row-boat hire. It features nature reserves, animal enclosures, and a botanical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garden</ENAMEX>. There is also an open-air <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">theater</ENAMEX>, which holds performances in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX>.
Zaanse Schans
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zaanse Schans</ENAMEX> is the archetypal <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> landscape personified, and lies just <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a few miles</NUMEX> north of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> in the suburb of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zaadam</ENAMEX>.
This landscape is no accident or happy coincidence but a living <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> created in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1960</TIMEX>, which has brought together a number of farmhouses, windmills, dairies, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">barnsÂ â€”Â real</ENAMEX> agricultural <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> which would have been demolished had they not been relocated here. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zaanse Schans</ENAMEX> has working <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mills</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cheese</ENAMEX>-making <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factories</ENAMEX>, and clog workshops, situated on a canalside. You are free to explore at your own pace and maybe enjoy a pannekoeken (pancake) while youâ€™re there.
Excursions
A tour of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> north of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX>
Although <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">750,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">ten-minute</TIMEX> journey can transport you out into the countryside with fields as far as the eye can see. You donâ€™t need a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> to visit and explore the pretty <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX>; public buses provide a very comprehensive, easy, and cheap service.
To the north of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> are several small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> which not only provide a contrast to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> landscape, but also take you to the heart of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agricultural North Holland</ENAMEX>.
The landscape is flat, and cut with dikes and narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">drainage canals</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Cows</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sheep</ENAMEX> can be seen grazing, numerous wading <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX>, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">herons</ENAMEX>, keep a watchful eye on the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">every few hundred yards</NUMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">farmhouse</ENAMEX> complete with several single-story <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">barns</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Broek</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Waterland</ENAMEX> is the first settlement reached once outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> environs. A small collection of quaint wooden <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> it is surrounded by <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canals</ENAMEX> and natural streams. Further north is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monnickendam</ENAMEX>, once a large fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zuider Zee</ENAMEX> which lost its raison dâ€™Ãªtre when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Afsluitdijk</ENAMEX> was completed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1932</TIMEX>.
The pretty gabled <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> which line the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> were once <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cottages</ENAMEX> for fisherfolk and the small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port</ENAMEX> still plays host to a fleet of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX>. Many are now in private hands, or work as pleasure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX> season. There is also a large, private <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">marina</ENAMEX> filled with sailboats which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> out on to the open water on any sunny <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekend</TIMEX>. Walk around the old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX> to find vestiges of the traditional lifestyle. A few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> still <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> for eels, and process them in small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">â€œfactoriesâ€</ENAMEX> along the quayside. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> you can buy the catch of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stalls</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>. There are also some good <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> around the harbor.
Just <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2.75 miles</NUMEX>) beyond <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monnickendam</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marken</ENAMEX>, one of the most beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Netherlands</ENAMEX> and home to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calvinist Dutch</ENAMEX> whose traditions reach back <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>. The older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhabitants</ENAMEX> of this close-knit <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> still wear traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> costume as everyday wear.
Until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1957</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> was situated on an island, remote from the outside world. The opening of a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roadway</ENAMEX> linking the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> to the mainland brought many changes for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhabitants</ENAMEX>. Today <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marken</ENAMEX> welcomes <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> but not their <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX>, which must be left in a large car <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> on the outskirts. You can walk through the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> with its traditional painted wooden <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> to the picture-perfect port. Stop at the tiny <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> on the quayside, which holds an eclectic mix of seafaring and fishing memorabilia.
Traveling from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monnickendam</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marken</ENAMEX>, the road leads out into open water, home to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds of thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX>. The native <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">herons</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ducks</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">moorhens</ENAMEX> see many species of migratory <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> who fly north for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX> and return south as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> approaches. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> also makes for good cycling, being flat and smooth, or for walking. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Head</ENAMEX> out towards the old lighthouse which sits surrounded by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> on a lonely promontory.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North of Marken</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monnickendam</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Volendam</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catholic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterpart</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Protestant Marken</ENAMEX>. It is perhaps the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> most changed by tourism, with cafÃ©s and souvenir <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> lining the harbor.
Our tour finishes at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Edam</ENAMEX>, famed for its <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cheese</ENAMEX>, with a pretty kaaswaag (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cheese Weigh House</ENAMEX>) dating from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1592</TIMEX>. Look out for the wonderfully named <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">KwakelbrugÂ â€”Â the</ENAMEX> narrowest old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX> in town, which allows only single-file foot traffic to cross. The center of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> has an unusual paved <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">overlock</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Damsluis</ENAMEX>, just below the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Captainâ€™s House</ENAMEX>, dating from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1540</TIMEX>. Despite its worldwide renown, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Edam</ENAMEX> is still unspoiled and there are some pretty <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> where you can enjoy lunch before heading back to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Haarlem</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Keukenhof</ENAMEX> bulb fields
Haarlem, situated <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only 19 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">12 miles</NUMEX>) from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">birthplace</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Frans Hals</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Dutch School</ENAMEX> of painting which developed during the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golden Age</ENAMEX>. He was a peer of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rembrandtâ</ENAMEX>€™s among others.
The center of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> is a maze of narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> filled with historic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>, all of which fall under the shadow of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 15th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. Bavokerk</ENAMEX>, an enormous <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gothic</ENAMEX> edifice which boasts one of the finest organs in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> installed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1735</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mozart</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Handel</ENAMEX> are both said to have played the instrument and you can hear it for yourself on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoons</TIMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recitals</ENAMEX> fill the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> with music.
Across <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lepelstraat</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Frans Hals Museum</ENAMEX>, a suitable testimony to the townâ€™s most famous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX>, who was still happily painting in his eighties. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> was opened in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1913</TIMEX> at the site of an old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">menâ€™s home</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vleeshal</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meat</ENAMEX> market) dating from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1603</TIMEX>, both of which had been painted by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hals</ENAMEX> during his lifetime.
On the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">River Spaarne</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Teylers Museum</ENAMEX>, founded by silk merchant <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pieter Teyler van der Hulst</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1778</TIMEX>, and said to be <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hollandâ</ENAMEX>€™s oldest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> collection. Teyler, having no heir, bequeathed his fortune to the advancement of the arts and sciences, and there is an interesting collection of scientific instruments among other artifacts. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> has collections ranging from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">minerals</ENAMEX> and fossils, to medals and coins.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Every spring</TIMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-April</TIMEX> to the end of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX>, the fields between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Haarlem</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> erupt in a rainbow of color, which stretches as far as the eye can see. The celebrated <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> tulips flower in unison, creating a carpet as amazing as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Josephâ€™s Biblical</ENAMEX> coat, and they attract <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these few weeks</TIMEX> of beauty.
Near the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lisse</ENAMEX> are the celebrated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Keukenhof Gardens</ENAMEX>, a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">28-hectare</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">69-acre</NUMEX>) showpiece flower garden which opens its doors to the public. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Youâ€™ll</ENAMEX> find crocus, hyacinth, and narcissus blooms along with the tulip, in colors you normally only see in your imagination. The landscape at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Keukenhof</ENAMEX> is enhanced by pretty windmills, adding to the authentic <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> feel. There is also a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX> and a gift <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop</ENAMEX> where you can buy <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">bulbs</ENAMEX>, blooms, and other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> souvenirs.
Nearby you can visit the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bloemenveiling</ENAMEX> or flower auction <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legmeerdijk</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Every day</TIMEX> it auctions <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of blooms, which disappear out of the auction <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">room</ENAMEX> to be dispatched around the world within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX>. Itâ€™s fascinating to watch the action (or lack of it) as miniature trains carry the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> through the auction <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> to assess. A large electronic bid-taker on the wall reflects the current bidding price; this happens several times every <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minute</TIMEX>. The sheer size of the auction house is what gives pause for <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">thoughtÂ â€”Â the walkway</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spectators</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1.6 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 mile</NUMEX>) long.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alkmaar</ENAMEX> and the cheese market
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Dutch cheeses</ENAMEX> are world renowned, and the small red and yellow <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edam</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gouda</ENAMEX> rounds can be found in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">supermarkets</ENAMEX> and grocery <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> in just about every <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> of the western world. However in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Holland</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cheese isnâ</ENAMEX>€™t so much an industry as a way of life, and tradition still has a part to play in the production and distribution of the product.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alkmaar</ENAMEX> is a small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">40 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">25 miles</NUMEX>) from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> but easily reached by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>. It has been the center of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cheese</ENAMEX> production for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many centuries</TIMEX> and is now the only <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> which continues with a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cheese</ENAMEX> market <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every Friday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX>.
The large <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> in front of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 14th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Waaggebouw</ENAMEX> or weigh <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> becomes a showcase of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cheese</ENAMEX>. Rounds of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cheese</ENAMEX> are piled there ready to be taken off on wooden sleds to be weighed. Uniformed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> of porters transport the sleds on shoulder harnesses and each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> playfully attempts to be faster than their rivals, much to the amusement of the large <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> enjoys a busy market for other produce on â€œcheeseâ€ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Fridays</TIMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Waaggebouw</ENAMEX> contains the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hollandse Kaasmuseum or Holland Cheese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>, which is open throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX>, and, nearby, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grote Kerk or Large Church</ENAMEX> contains the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tomb</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Floris V</ENAMEX>, who granted <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> its rights to carry goods toll free in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 13th century</TIMEX>. In a sense he started the economic life of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> and could be said to be its founding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>.
