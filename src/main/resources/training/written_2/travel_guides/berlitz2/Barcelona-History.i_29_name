A Brief History
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barcelona</ENAMEX> was originally called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barcino</ENAMEX>, named for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carthaginian</ENAMEX> general and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hannibal</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hamilcar Barca</ENAMEX>, who established a base on the northeastern coast of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iberia</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">237 b.c. Phoenicians</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greeks</ENAMEX> had previously settled the area, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barcino</ENAMEX> occupied the site of an earlier <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Celtiberian</ENAMEX> settlement called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Laie</ENAMEX>. But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Romans</ENAMEX>, who conquered all of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iberia</ENAMEX>, left the most indelible marks on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barcelona.</ENAMEX> They defeated the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carthaginians</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">206 b.c.</TIMEX> and ruled <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next 600 years</TIMEX>, a period in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> law, language, and culture took <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX> root across the peninsula. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roman citadel</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barcelona</ENAMEX>, surrounded by a massive wall, occupied high ground where the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">cathedral</ENAMEX> and city <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX> now stand. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">From the first century</TIMEX> a.d., <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> spread through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catalonia</ENAMEX>.
After sacking <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a.d. 410</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Visigoths</ENAMEX> swept into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>. They adopted <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barcelona</ENAMEX> as their capital from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">531</NUMEX> until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">554</TIMEX>, when they moved it to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toledo</ENAMEX>. The invasion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moors</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">711</TIMEX> brought the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Visigothic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">kingdom</ENAMEX> to an end, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Catalonia</ENAMEX> was briefly overrun by the invaders from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX>. After their defeat beyond the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pyrenees</ENAMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Franks</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">732</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moors</ENAMEX> withdrew, without ever retaining a lasting foothold in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Catalonia</ENAMEX>. Charlemagne‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">knights</ENAMEX> installed themselves in the border <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">counties</ENAMEX> to guard the southern flank of his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX>.
A feudal lord, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Guifr√© el Pil√≥s¬†‚Äî¬†Wilfred the Hairy¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†became the Count of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barcelona.</ENAMEX> He founded a dynasty in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">878</TIMEX> that would rule for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nearly five centuries</TIMEX>. While much of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> was under <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Moorish</ENAMEX> domination, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barcelona</ENAMEX> and most of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catalonia</ENAMEX> remained linked to northern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, a geo-political wrinkle that would do much to determine the distinct <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Catalonian</ENAMEX> character.
Catalonia‚Äôs legendary founding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> also gave the budding <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> its flag of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> horizontal red stripes on a gold <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">field</ENAMEX>, the oldest still in use in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legend</ENAMEX> holds that the stripes were etched in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wilfred‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX>, drawn on his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shield</ENAMEX> as an escutcheon by the fingers of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Frankish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX> after the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">count</ENAMEX> had courageously defended his overlord in a battle.
When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis V</ENAMEX> refused to come to their aid against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moorish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">raiders</ENAMEX>, the counts of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barcelona</ENAMEX> declared their independence in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">988</TIMEX>, a date celebrated as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catalonia‚</ENAMEX>Äôs birth as a nation-state. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catalan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> was soon enlarged through marriage and military adventure. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ram√≥n Berenguer III</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1096‚Äì1131</ENAMEX>) captured <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mallorca, Ibiza</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tarragona</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moors</ENAMEX> and acquired the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">county</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Provence</ENAMEX> through his heiress <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>. His <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">successor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ram√≥n Berenguer IV</ENAMEX>, united <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Catalonia</ENAMEX> with neighboring <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arag√≥n</ENAMEX> by marriage, and his son <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alfonso II</ENAMEX> became the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> joint-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arag√≥n</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catalonia</ENAMEX> and was known as ‚Äúthe <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Emperor</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pyrenees</ENAMEX>.‚Äù His <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">kingdom</ENAMEX> extended all the way to <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Nice</ENAMEX>. But much of this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">territory</ENAMEX> was lost by the next <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alfonso‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catholic</ENAMEX>, who picked the losing side in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> crusade against the heretics of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Albi</ENAMEX>.
Successive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX> turned their attention towards the conquest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX> basin. <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Jaume I</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1213‚Äì1276</ENAMEX>), known as <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚Äúthe Conqueror</ENAMEX>,‚Äù consolidated control over the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Balearic Islands</ENAMEX> and claimed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Valencia</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pedro III</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1276‚Äì 1285</ENAMEX>) annexed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sicily</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1282</TIMEX>. Over the ensuing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">century</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barcelona</ENAMEX> reached the peak of its glory: Its mercantilist trade grew rapidly throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX>, and its <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">territories</ENAMEX> included <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sardinia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Corsica</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Naples</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roussillon</ENAMEX> in southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>, and briefly, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX>. 
The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Middle Ages</TIMEX>, from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late-13th‚Äì15th centuries</TIMEX>, were a time of great <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barcelona</ENAMEX>, giving rise to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">cathedral</ENAMEX> and other great <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Gothic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palaces</ENAMEX> and monuments. Wedged between <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX> territories, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barcelona</ENAMEX> served as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> of scientific knowledge and scholarship. The arts flourished in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> and monasteries of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catalonia</ENAMEX>, patronized by a vigorous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> of artisans, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bankers</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">merchants</ENAMEX>, including an important <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX>. Nascent democratic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX> appeared with a code of laws, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Usatges de Barcelona</ENAMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 11th century</TIMEX>; a municipal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">council</ENAMEX> with participation of leading <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> called the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Consell de Cent</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Council</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">One Hundred</ENAMEX>) was formed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1249</TIMEX>; and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1283</TIMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parliament</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Corts</ENAMEX>, for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catalonia</ENAMEX>, originated, later to become the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Generalitat</ENAMEX>, the civil <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>.
Barcelona‚Äôs fate took another decisive turn when the marriage of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ferdinand of Arag√≥n-Catalonia</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ferr√°n</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catalans</ENAMEX>) to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isabella</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Castile</ENAMEX> joined their <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> crowns and formed the nucleus of a united <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. Under <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los Reyes</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cat√≥licos¬†‚Äî¬†called ‚ÄúThe Catholic Monarchs‚Äù</ENAMEX> because they finally captured the last Moorish redoubt on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Peninsula</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Granada</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1492¬†‚</NUMEX>Äî¬†Catalonia was fully incorporated into the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Castilian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. After <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Christopher Columbus</ENAMEX> discovered <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>, he was received by the monarchs in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barcelona‚Äôs Royal Palace</ENAMEX>. Despite the symbolic gesture, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Castile</ENAMEX>, the power <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>, exclusively exploited New World riches, excluding <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barcelona</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">300 years</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catholic</ENAMEX> church‚Äôs hard-line <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Inquisition</ENAMEX> expelled <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barcelona</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Girona</ENAMEX> were particularly affected. 
During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16th century</TIMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golden Age</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>, the political influence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catalonia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barcelona</ENAMEX> declined even further. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dutch-speaking Hapsburg</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandson</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ferdinand</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isabella</ENAMEX> was anointed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Charles I of Spain</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1516</TIMEX>. He inherited the title of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holy Roman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Emperor</ENAMEX> and became <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles V</ENAMEX>, with duties throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> that gave him little time for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>. His <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philip II</ENAMEX> moved the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> of the great <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toledo</ENAMEX> to previously insignificant <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX>.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1640</TIMEX>, with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> at war, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Catalonia</ENAMEX> declared itself an independent <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">republic</ENAMEX>, allied to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philip IV‚</ENAMEX>Äôs enemy <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>. After the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> defeat in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1652</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catalan</ENAMEX> territories north of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pyrenees</ENAMEX> were delivered to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>, fixing the border where it is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>. The ensuing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> were rife with constant wars, shifting alliances, and disputes over succession to the crown. In all of these conflicts, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barcelona</ENAMEX> automatically sided with whomever opposed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX>, and usually ended up the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">loser</ENAMEX>.
The worst of these episodes came in the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">War of the Spanish Succession</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1701‚Äì1713</ENAMEX>) between the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">backers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philip of Anjou</ENAMEX>, the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandson</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Louis XIV</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hapsburg</ENAMEX> claimant, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Archduke Charles</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Austria</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles</ENAMEX> was enthusiastically received when he landed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Catalonia</ENAMEX>, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philip</ENAMEX>, supported by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>, won the war and became the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bourbon ruler</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philip V.</ENAMEX> After a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13-month</TIMEX> siege, on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11 September 1714</TIMEX>, the royal army captured and sacked <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barcelona.</ENAMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catalan Generalitat</ENAMEX> was dissolved and the city‚Äôs privileges were abolished. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ciutadella</ENAMEX> fortress was built to keep the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populace</ENAMEX> subdued, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> use of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Catalan language</ENAMEX> was outlawed. Catalonia celebrates this defeat as its national holiday, a symbol of the spirit of nationalist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX>.
Discord within the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> or conflict with foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">powers</ENAMEX> frequently served as an excuse for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catalan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">separatists</ENAMEX> to rise up, though their rebellions were usually summarily quashed. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">From 1808 to 1814</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> again became a battleground, with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> taking on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Napoleon‚Äôs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Peninsular War</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Napoleon</ENAMEX> attacked and destroyed <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catalonia‚</ENAMEX>Äôs sacred <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shrine</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monastery</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montserrat</ENAMEX>. 
The spirit of liberalism prevalent in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> was tardy in reaching <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>. After many reverses, a democratic constitution was finally proclaimed and constitutional monarchy was instituted in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1874</TIMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Four years later</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barcelona</ENAMEX> was at long last given the right to trade with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New World</ENAMEX>. 
Meanwhile, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> had gone about its business, devoting its energies to industrialization. Barcelona‚Äôs medieval walls were torn down to make way for an expansion in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-19th century</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eixample</ENAMEX>, an elegant modern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">district</ENAMEX>, was laid out on a grid of broad <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">avenues</ENAMEX> where the new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">industrialists</ENAMEX> built <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansions</ENAMEX>. Wealthy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patrons</ENAMEX> supported forward-looking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architects</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Antoni Gaud√</ENAMEX>≠ and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Llu√≠s Dom√®nech i Muntaner</ENAMEX>, who embraced modernisme. Prosperity was accompanied by a revival in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Catalan</ENAMEX> arts and letters, a period known in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Catalan</ENAMEX> as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaixen√ßa</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX>). In a burst of optimism, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> bid for worldwide recognition with the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Universal Exposition of 1888</ENAMEX>, built on the site of the hated <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ciutadella</ENAMEX> fortress.
With the industrial expansion, an urban working class evolved in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barcelona.</ENAMEX> Agitation for social <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">justice</ENAMEX> and regionalist ferment created a combustible atmosphere, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barcelona</ENAMEX> became the scene of strikes and anarchist violence. The modern <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Socialist Party</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.G.T., Spain‚</ENAMEX>Äôs largest trade <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">union</ENAMEX>, were both founded in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barcelona</ENAMEX> at this time. For their part, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">industrialists</ENAMEX> sought <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Catalan</ENAMEX> autonomy as a way to be freed from interference (and taxation) by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1914</TIMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">union</ENAMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catalan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">provinces¬†‚Äî¬†Barcelona</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tarragona, Lleida</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L√©rida</ENAMEX>), and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Girona</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Gerona)¬†‚Äî¬†was</ENAMEX> formed, known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mancomunitat</ENAMEX>, with limited autonomy. The region profited from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> neutrality in <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War I</ENAMEX> by trading with both sides, further expanding its industry. 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mancomunitat</ENAMEX> was dissolved in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1924</TIMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">General</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Primo de Rivera</ENAMEX>, who established a military <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">dictatorship</ENAMEX> and once again banned the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Catalan</ENAMEX> language. Despite this setback, an optimistic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barcelona</ENAMEX> plunged energetically into the preparation of another <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">International Exhibition</ENAMEX>, with monumental <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>, pavilions, and sports facilities erected on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Montju√Øc hill</ENAMEX>. It opened <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few months</TIMEX> before the stock market crash of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1929</TIMEX>.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1931</TIMEX>, general elections brought the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">party</ENAMEX> to power, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alfonso XIII</ENAMEX> escaped in exile. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">The following year</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catalonia</ENAMEX> won a charter establishing home rule, restoration of the regional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parliament</ENAMEX> and flag, and recognition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catalan</ENAMEX> as the official language of the region. For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next several years</TIMEX> the pendulum of power in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> swung back and forth between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Left and Right</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">army</ENAMEX> rebelled in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1936</TIMEX>, initiating the brutal and bloody <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Spanish Civil War</ENAMEX>, in which both sides committed atrocities. Many of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barcelona‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX> were put to the torch by anti-clerical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mobs</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, firmly <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX>, briefly became the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late 1937</TIMEX> and was a rallying point for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Brigade</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barcelona</ENAMEX> was one of the last <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> to fall to the rebel <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francisco Franco</ENAMEX> at the war‚Äôs end in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1939</TIMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Civil War</ENAMEX> ended with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 700,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">combatants</ENAMEX> dead on both sides; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">another 30,000</NUMEX> were executed or assassinated, including many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priests</ENAMEX> and nuns; and perhaps <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> were killed in air raids. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barcelona</ENAMEX> was repeatedly bombed and its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> suffered great hardship.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catalonia</ENAMEX> paid a heavy price in defeat. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Franco</ENAMEX> abolished all regional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX> and established central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> controls. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Catalan language</ENAMEX> was again proscribed, even in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX>. For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barcelona</ENAMEX> received little financial support from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> remained essentially cut off from the rest of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. Nevertheless, the city‚Äôs industry recovered, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one million</NUMEX> job <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hunters</ENAMEX> from less prosperous parts of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> migrated to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barcelona</ENAMEX> area. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">From the 1960s</TIMEX> a tourism boom along the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Costa Brava</ENAMEX> lifted the local economy and brought the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Franco‚</ENAMEX>Äôs conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> in touch with modern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>.
When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Franco</ENAMEX> died in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1975</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> rapidly emerged from its isolation. The coronation of his designated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">successor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Juan Carlos</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandson</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alfonso XIII</ENAMEX>, brought the restoration of parliamentary democracy and a relaxation of customs and laws. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1978 Constitution</ENAMEX> granted degrees of autonomy to <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spain‚Äôs fractious</ENAMEX> regions. While a militant <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Basque</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minority</ENAMEX> demanded greater independence and resorted to terrorist tactics that continue to this day, most <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catalans</ENAMEX> were content with the restoration of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Generalitat</ENAMEX> and regional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parliament</ENAMEX> and the return of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catalan</ENAMEX> as an official language.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charismatic Felipe Gonz√°lez</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Socialist</ENAMEX>, was <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prime Minister</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1982 to 1986</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> became a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Economic Community</ENAMEX> (now <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Union</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX>) in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</TIMEX>, hastening the country‚Äôs modernization. Though <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gonz√°lez</ENAMEX> was credited by many as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX> of the new <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>, he finally succumbed to incessant charges of corruption and incompetence in the highest levels of his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU‚</ENAMEX>Äôs freeing of trade tariffs and controls, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barcelona‚</ENAMEX>Äôs hosting of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Summer Olympic Games</ENAMEX>, acted as catalysts for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Catalonia¬†‚Äî¬†Spain‚Äôs</ENAMEX> industrial engine and bridge to the rest of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Europe¬†‚Äî¬†to</ENAMEX> embark on a significant economic boom.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>, the surging <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Partido Popular</ENAMEX>, led by a rather uncharismatic former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">accountant</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jos√© Mar√≠a Aznar</ENAMEX>, was elected, forming the first conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> since the return of democracy. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barcelona</ENAMEX>, meanwhile, continued to be ably steered by a progressive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Socialist mayor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Pascual Maragall</ENAMEX>, who oversaw the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Olympics</ENAMEX> bid and subsequent civic works that contributed to the transformation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maragall</ENAMEX> stepped down in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX> to run for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catalan Generalitat</ENAMEX> and was succeeded by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joan Clos I Matheu</ENAMEX>.
