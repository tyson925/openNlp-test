WHERE TO GO
You‚Äôll need to plan carefully for a thorough exploration of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Berlin¬†‚Äî¬†with</ENAMEX> a total area of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">880 sq km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">340 sq miles</NUMEX>) it is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than eight</NUMEX> times the size of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX>. Since the reorganization of the municipal transport system, virtually the whole of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> is accessible via underground (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U-Bahn</ENAMEX>), overhead (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S-Bahn</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">railways</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bus</ENAMEX>, or tram. You should have no difficulty in reaching the outlying areas, including <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spandau</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dahlem</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX> and lakes in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grunewald</ENAMEX>, and the summer <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palaces</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Potsdam</ENAMEX>, by public transport. Busy traffic and the inevitable parking problems make car rental a less attractive, and quite unnecessary, option.
A good orientation exercise is to start with an organized sightseeing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">tour¬†‚Äî¬†by bus</ENAMEX>, for instance, departing from the eastern end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kurf√ºrstendamm.</ENAMEX> Cruises on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Landwehrkanal or Spree</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Havel</ENAMEX> rivers offer a more leisurely way of taking in areas of eastern and western <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX> that are not normally covered by the tour <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">buses</ENAMEX>.
The area on and around the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kurf√</ENAMEX>ºrstendamm is probably the best place to begin, as it‚Äôs very well served by information <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> and other tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX>. Your first port of call should be the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Berlin Tourist Office</ENAMEX> which can be found at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Budapester Stra√üe</ENAMEX> side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Europa-Center</ENAMEX> and is open <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX>; the helpful, multi-lingual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> will assist you with maps, leaflets, and other useful information.
Around <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Kurf√</ENAMEX>ºrstendamm
Berlin‚Äôs main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">thoroughfare</ENAMEX>, literally <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚ÄúPrince Elector‚Äôs Embankment</ENAMEX>,‚Äù is known to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berliners</ENAMEX> as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ku‚Äôdamm.</ENAMEX> It extends for <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 1‚ÅÑ2 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 2 miles</NUMEX>) through the center of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, forming a triangular area enclosed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lietzenburger Stra√üe, Hardenbergstra√üe, Leibnizstra√üe</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tauentzienstra√üe</ENAMEX>. Here you‚Äôll find a vast array of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, caf√©s, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">theaters</ENAMEX>, cinemas, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">art galleries</ENAMEX>, as well as no-frills fast-food stands and the inevitable souvenir-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sellers</ENAMEX>.
Impressed by the prolongation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Champs-Elys√</ENAMEX>©es in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bois de Boulogne</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bismarck</ENAMEX> wanted to extend the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ku‚</ENAMEX>Äôdamm out as far as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grunewald</ENAMEX> forest. However, such pretentions were never realized, and finally the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">avenue</ENAMEX> linked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church</ENAMEX> to nothing grander than the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Halensee</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">railway station</ENAMEX>.
When you are in the center of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tauentzienstra√üe</ENAMEX>, notice the intertwined steel tubes of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX> sculpture, which were designed for the city‚Äôs <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">750th anniversary</TIMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</TIMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two halves</NUMEX> are tantalizingly close to each other, yet fail to touch, poignantly symbolizing the once divided <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>.
At the far end of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tauentzienstra√üe, Wittenbergplatz</ENAMEX> is a large, populous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> and contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Berlin‚</ENAMEX>Äôs many memorials: a stark sign outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U-Bahn</ENAMEX> station which reminds <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passers-by</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Nazi</ENAMEX> concentration <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camps</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX> itself is a beautifully restored <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Art Deco</ENAMEX> delight with lovely wooden ticket <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">booths</ENAMEX>, period posters, and a central standing clock.
More than just a department store, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">KaDeWe</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kaufhaus des Westens</ENAMEX>), located on the edge of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wittenbergplatz</ENAMEX>, has achieved the status of a monument since its foundation in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1907</TIMEX>. The food emporium on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">sixth</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX> is extraordinary. Here, gourmet globetrotters can perch on a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX> stool and sample not only <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> from all over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> but also <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>, and Swiss <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cuisine</ENAMEX>. One floor up, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wintergarten</ENAMEX> is a vast food <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> in the glass-roofed <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">atrium</ENAMEX> where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shoppers</ENAMEX> can help themselves to less exotic, but equally tasty fare. It‚Äôs an ideal spot for a hearty breakfast before a day‚Äôs shopping. The toy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> is also well worth a visit.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Breitscheidplatz</ENAMEX> is the big pedestrianized area at the base of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Europa-Center</ENAMEX> and a busy gathering place for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shoppers</ENAMEX> and sightseers during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX>. In the center of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joachim Schmettau‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">granite Weltkugelbrunnen</ENAMEX> (or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fountain</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World</ENAMEX>), which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locals</ENAMEX> have gaily christened the ‚Äúaquatic dumpling.‚Äù
Soaring above it is another very powerful symbol of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kaiser-Wilhelm-Ged√§chtniskirche</ENAMEX>. The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1943</TIMEX> bombing, combined with artillery fire at the end of the war, left the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> with the broken stump of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">spire¬†‚Äî¬†63 m</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">206 ft</ENAMEX>) compared with its original <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">113 m</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">370 ft)¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†as a monumental ruin recalling the city‚Äôs destruction. Flanking it, a modern octagonal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> to the east and a chapel and hexagonal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> to the west represent the city‚Äôs post-war rebirth. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Stained</ENAMEX> glass from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chartres</ENAMEX> set in walls of molded concrete casts a mysterious bluish glow over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ku‚</ENAMEX>Äôdamm at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>.
Built <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between 1891‚Äì1895</NUMEX> to honor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilhelm</ENAMEX> I, the remains of this <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Neo</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Romanesque</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> constitute a memorial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX> to celebrate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hohenzollerns‚</ENAMEX>Äô pious monarchism. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mosaic</ENAMEX> representing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christ the King</ENAMEX> is set above friezes and reliefs of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prussian</ENAMEX> monarchs from <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Friedrich I</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1415‚Äì1440</ENAMEX>) to the last <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crown prince</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Friedrich Wilhelm</ENAMEX>. On <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wall</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilhelm</ENAMEX> I confers with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chancellor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bismarck</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Field Marshals Moltke</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roon</ENAMEX>. With their taste for irreverent nicknames, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berliners</ENAMEX> have deflated the monuments‚Äô imperial or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pacifist</ENAMEX> intentions by dubbing the original church the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúbroken tooth‚Äù</ENAMEX> and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> main additions the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚Äúlipstick‚Äù and ‚Äúpowder</ENAMEX> compact.‚Äù
Beyond the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> is the enormous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Europa-Center</ENAMEX>, between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tauentzienstra√üe</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Budapester Stra√üe</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> was built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> scores of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX>, and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">casino</ENAMEX> amid artificial ponds and waterfalls.
A new, multi-media experience in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ku‚Äôdamm Karree</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Ku‚Äôdamm 207‚Äì208</ENAMEX>) dramatically relates 800 years of the city‚Äôs history. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Visitors</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Story</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX> begin their fascinating journey in a nuclear blast<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">-proof</NUMEX> underground bunker, and finish <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floors</ENAMEX> up, where there is a stunning view over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zoo</ENAMEX>, entrance on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Budapester Stra√üe</ENAMEX>, has one of the most varied collections of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. Beyond the colorful and pagoda-arched <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elefantentor</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Elephant Gate</ENAMEX>) are <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">35 hectares</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">86 acres</NUMEX>) of parkland where you will be able to observe <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">elephants</ENAMEX>, giant pandas from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>, and the rare single-horned rhinoceros from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>.
Sooner or later, everybody comes to promenade along the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ku‚Äôdamm</ENAMEX>, and a suitable vantage point from which to survey them is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caf√© Kranzler</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX> at the corner of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joachimstaler Stra√üe</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">It‚Äôs</ENAMEX> now decidedly bourgeois, although the original <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kranzler</ENAMEX> at the west end of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Unter den Linden</ENAMEX> between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Friedrichstra√üe</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Brandenburg Gate</ENAMEX> was a hotbed of radical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intellectuals</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1848</TIMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">avenue</ENAMEX> lost almost all the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jugendstil</ENAMEX> architecture of its Wilhelminian heyday during <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX>, but a vestige can be seen in the elegant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caf√© M√∂hring</ENAMEX> just across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>. Otherwise the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> is resolutely <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">modern¬†‚Äî¬†gleaming glass</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steel</ENAMEX>, and an occasional touch of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">marble¬†‚Äî¬†but</ENAMEX> still a magnet for fashionable shopping.
Like so much of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, this area is in a constant state of redevelopment. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Berlin Panoptikum</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Waxworks</ENAMEX>) opens in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>, and a stunning, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX>-story <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>, known as <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Zoo Window</ENAMEX>, is being erected.
Off the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ku‚</ENAMEX>Äôdamm at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Fasanenstra√üe 79</NUMEX> you will find the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">J√ºdisches Gemeindezentrum</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jewish Community Center</ENAMEX>). Framing the entrance is the domed portal from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">synagogue</ENAMEX> which was burned during the fateful <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kristallnacht</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1938</TIMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX>). The modern <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> serves as a cultural <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> still living in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX> today¬†‚Äî¬†in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1933</TIMEX> they numbered <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 170,000</NUMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Noah‚Äôs Ark</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX> inside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Community Center</ENAMEX> serves up substantial kosher fare as well as holding a marvelous <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> buffet.
At <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Fasanenstra√üe 24</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stands</ENAMEX> the intimate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K√§the-Kollwitz Museum</ENAMEX>, containing sketches and sculptures by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">K√§the Kollwitz</ENAMEX>, housed in an elegant villa.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">It‚Äôs</ENAMEX> worth exploring some of the other side <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> off the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ku‚Äôdamm.</ENAMEX> As well as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fasanenstra√üe</ENAMEX>, you will discover many other elegant tree-lined boulevards studded with beautiful, balconied villas, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antiques</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">art galleries</ENAMEX>, and exclusive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">designer boutiques</ENAMEX>. A little to the north, fashionable <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Savignyplatz</ENAMEX> provides a focus for first-class art and architecture bookshops and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">art galleries</ENAMEX>, located in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arches</ENAMEX> beneath the overhead S-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bahn</ENAMEX> railway line. Here you will find an abundance of literary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">caf√</ENAMEX>©s, bistros, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bars</ENAMEX>, with plenty of outside seating.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tiergarten Area</ENAMEX>
Despite its name, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tiergarten</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">literally ‚Äúanimal garden‚Äù</ENAMEX>) is not another <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">zoo</ENAMEX>. For the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hohenzollern</ENAMEX> princes, it was a forest for hunting <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">deer</ENAMEX> and wild boar. After <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frederick the Great</ENAMEX> cut down the woods to create a formal <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> garden for his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">August Ferdinand</ENAMEX>, it was replanted with <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th century</TIMEX> and transformed into a landscaped <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>. Following <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berliners</ENAMEX> stripped away the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> again¬<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">†‚Äî¬†for fuel</ENAMEX>. Everything you will see here <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> has been planted since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1950</TIMEX>, among pleasant ponds, caf√©s, and various monuments.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Englischer Garten</ENAMEX> (beside <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Altonaer Stra√üe</ENAMEX>), financed by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> donations, was laid out by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shropshire Horticultural Society</ENAMEX>, and forms part of the grounds of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Schlo√ü Bellevue</ENAMEX>. This white, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Neo-Classical</ENAMEX> style palace is the official <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX>.
On the northwest side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tiergarten</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hansaviertel</ENAMEX>, a chic, though slightly dated, residential neighborhood rebuilt by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architects</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">International Building Exhibition</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1957</TIMEX>. Among the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">winners</ENAMEX> were <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bauhaus</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter Gropius</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">H√§ndelallee 1‚Äì9</ENAMEX>), the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Brazilian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oscar Niemeyer</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Altonaer Stra√üe</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4‚Äì14</NUMEX>), and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alvar Aalto</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Finland</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Klopstockstra√üe 30</NUMEX>). Their names are inscribed along with the locations of their projects on a map on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Klopstockstra√üe</ENAMEX>.
Nearby, at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Hanseatenweg 10</NUMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Akademie der K√ºnste</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arts Academy</ENAMEX>), distinguished by the splendid <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Moore</ENAMEX> sculpture outside, holds concerts, plays, and exhibitions of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">avant-garde art</ENAMEX>.
At the center of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>, on the circle of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gro√üer Stern</ENAMEX>, the soaring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Siegess√§ule</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Victory Column</ENAMEX>) is an unabashed monument dedicated to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prussian</ENAMEX> militarism. It was completed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1873</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</TIMEX> after the victory over the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>, and also commemorates successes against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Denmark</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Austria</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1864 and 1866</TIMEX> respectively. A climb of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">around 285</NUMEX> steps takes you to the top of the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">67 m</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">220 ft</ENAMEX>) column for a breathtaking view over the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> from beneath the gilded bronze statue of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Winged Victory</ENAMEX>.
On the north side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gro√üer Stern</ENAMEX> are monuments honoring the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architects</ENAMEX> of that first unification, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Field Marshals Moltke</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roon</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chancellor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bismarck</ENAMEX>.
Follow the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">River Spree</ENAMEX> to the east along <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spreeweg</ENAMEX> until you reach the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kongre√ühalle</ENAMEX>, built by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> as their country‚Äôs contribution to the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1957</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">International Building Exhibition</ENAMEX>. Officially renamed <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Haus der Kulturen</ENAMEX> der <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Welt</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House of World Cultures</ENAMEX>), the striking design, with its curved concrete roof, (which was rebuilt after collapsing in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1980</TIMEX>) led <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Berliners</ENAMEX> to dub the building the ‚Äúpregnant oyster.‚Äù The vast <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">space</ENAMEX> inside is used for temporary exhibitions on global cultures and non-European <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">avant-garde art</ENAMEX>, and there‚Äôs also a conference <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>, restaurant, caf√©, and theater. In front of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>, the pond features a sculpture in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bronze</ENAMEX> by the ubiquitous <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Moore</ENAMEX>, and is attractively illuminated at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>. An austere black <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure stands</ENAMEX> on the corner of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gro√üe Querallee</ENAMEX> near the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kongre√ühalle</ENAMEX>. Built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</TIMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">42 m-</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">138 ft-</ENAMEX>) tall <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> contains a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">68</NUMEX>-bell <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">carillon</ENAMEX>, played by hand on a special keyboard, which chimes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">noon</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>.
The Reichstag
A few minutes‚Äô walk from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kongre√ühalle</ENAMEX> you‚Äôll find the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reichstag</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>, its huge, new glass <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dome</ENAMEX>, with its mirrored central funnel, visible from much of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. The parliamentary home of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wilhelminian</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Weimar Germany</ENAMEX> displays the proud dedication <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dem deutschen Volke</ENAMEX> (To the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX>) on a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Neo-Classical</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">fa√ßade</ENAMEX> built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1894</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Wallot</ENAMEX>. This appeal to patriotism and democracy, set above <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Corinthian</ENAMEX> columns, outlasted the burning in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1933</TIMEX> and the bombs of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX>, and was given renewed significance when <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX> resumed its former role as the seat of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> of a unified <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>. Today, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dome</ENAMEX> is a major attraction for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Berliners</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> alike. They endure lengthy lines to be able to travel to the top, gazing out at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> and down into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bundestag</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX>. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of 2003</TIMEX>, the area in front of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Reichstag¬†‚Äî¬†currently</ENAMEX> a vast construction site¬†‚Äî¬†will be transformed, with the completion of all the new government district <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>, including the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Chancellery</ENAMEX>. An enormous new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Berlin Central Train Station</ENAMEX> is being erected at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lehrter Bahnhof</ENAMEX>, and new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">S‚Äì</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U‚</ENAMEX>Äìbahn <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lines</ENAMEX> are being built, to further extend the city‚Äôs already splendid <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> transport system.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South of the Siegess√§ule</ENAMEX> stands the elegant, modern shared complex which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">embassies</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Denmark</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Finland</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Holland</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Norway</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sweden</ENAMEX>, the architecture a stunning showcase for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Scandinavian</ENAMEX> design and materials.
The stylized industrial curves of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bauhaus-Archiv</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">73</NUMEX>) on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Landwehr</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canal</ENAMEX> were designed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter Gropius</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX> of the hugely influential <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bauhaus</ENAMEX> school of architecture, art, and design.
Note <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Emil Fahrenkamp‚</ENAMEX>Äôs gracefully curved, travertine-clad <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Bewag Building</ENAMEX> on the corner of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stauffenbergstra√üe</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reichpietschufer</ENAMEX>. It was built originally for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shell Oil</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1932</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gedenkst√§tte Deutscher Widerstand</ENAMEX> is a memorial to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fascism</ENAMEX> within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bendlerblock</ENAMEX>, the former <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> military <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX>. A bronze statue depicting a young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> with bound hands stands in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX> where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Graf von Stauffenberg</ENAMEX> and other army <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> (who conspired to blow up <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hitler</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20 July 1944</TIMEX>) were shot. An excellent exhibition, in the historical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> where the attempted coup was planned, contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 5,000</NUMEX> photographs and historical documents charting the tragic course of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX>.
At the corner of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Potsdamer Stra√üe, Bauhaus</ENAMEX> master <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mies van der Rohe‚</ENAMEX>Äôs design for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Neue Nationalgalerie</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20th-century</TIMEX> art (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">76</NUMEX>) is a square, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glass</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wall structure</ENAMEX> with a vast, black <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steel</ENAMEX> roof supported by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> massive steel columns. This work of characteristic elegant simplicity was completed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1968</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> before the architect‚Äôs death. It stands on a rather windswept, raised granite <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platform</ENAMEX> that serves as a sculpture <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> for huge outdoor pieces like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Moore‚Äôs Archer</ENAMEX>, as well as providing a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">playground</ENAMEX> for skate-boarders. 
Kulturforum
Beyond the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nationalgalerie</ENAMEX>, in dignified isolation, is the fine-steepled <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Neo-Romanesque St. Matth√§iskirche</ENAMEX>, built in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> style in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1846</TIMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St√ºler</ENAMEX>. It is the only pre-war building hereabouts to survive <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albert Speer‚</ENAMEX>Äôs redesign of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX>, and forms the nucleus about which the concert <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">halls</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX> of the city‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cultural Forum</ENAMEX> are clustered. The quality of exhibits in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX> here is simply outstanding. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gem√</ENAMEX>§ldegalerie is home to a remarkable collection of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> paintings from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 13th</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th centuries</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kunstgewerbemuseum</ENAMEX> displays a wide range of the most exquisitely-executed arts and crafts, from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medieval gold</ENAMEX> and silver church treasuries to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Baroque glass</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ceramics</ENAMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20th and 21st century</TIMEX> furniture and clothes. (See page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">74</NUMEX> for a description of the museum‚Äôs contents.)
The prints and watercolors that comprise the impressive <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kupferstichkabinett</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Engravings Collection</ENAMEX>) were transferred from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museumsinsel</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dahlem</ENAMEX> to a new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Matth√</ENAMEX>§iskirchplatz in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-1993</TIMEX>.
Eclipsed by the sober international style imposed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bauhaus</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1920s¬†‚</TIMEX>Äî¬†of which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Neue Nationalgalerie</ENAMEX> is a prime example¬†‚Äî¬†architect <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hans Scharoun</ENAMEX> was at last able to indulge his taste for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Expressionistic</ENAMEX> free-form <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX>. His <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> design, the controversial ochre and gold <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philharmonie</ENAMEX>, owes its tent-like shape to the demands of the concert <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall‚Äôs acoustics</ENAMEX> and sight-lines. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">home</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra</ENAMEX> was designed from the inside out, from the orchestra to the walls and roof. Viewed from across <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tiergartenstra√üe</ENAMEX>, the nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Musikinstrumentenmuseum</ENAMEX> is reminiscent of an open card index file and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> an extensive collection of instruments from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16th century</TIMEX> to the present.
The nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Staatsbibliothek</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Library</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Potsdamer Stra√üe</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX>, was also designed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scharoun</ENAMEX>. Despite its formidable dimensions, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> is a model of peace and harmony. A quite ingenious network of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">staircases</ENAMEX> leads to multi-level reading <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> and easily accessible stacks. It‚Äôs one of the largest modern library <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, and regularly holds documentary and photographic exhibitions as well as concerts.
Potsdamer Platz
Reduced by war and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Wall</ENAMEX> to a bleak no-man‚Äôs-land, the square that was at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time the busiest in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> has burst back into life in the most invigorating fashion. What was once a scar on the landscape, epitomizing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, is now a thriving arts, entertainment, shopping and business <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>. The impact of the towering, modern <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>, made almost predominantly from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glass</ENAMEX>, is breathtaking. Investment from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporations</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daimler-Chrysler</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> has resulted in the construction of shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">malls</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">theater</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">casino</ENAMEX>, a splendid <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX>, cinemas, and a film <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Almost 100,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> a day come here to marvel at the striking architecture and explore the latest attractions in this ever-changing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony Center</ENAMEX> is a vibrant entertainment complex, contained with a central <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX> under a glass ceiling. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Technophiles</ENAMEX> can check out the latest gadgets at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> department store, while film <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buffs</ENAMEX> will be intrigued by the exhibits at the excellent new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Film Museum</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX>. A fascinating contrast to the futuristic architecture and technological content can be found in the elegant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">remains</ENAMEX> of the old <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Grandhotel Esplanade</ENAMEX>, now preserved behind glass walls.
The nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arkaden</ENAMEX> shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> became a firm favorite with city <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shoppers</ENAMEX> as soon as it opened in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>, and the caf√©s, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">casino</ENAMEX>, and theater in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Marlene-Dietrich</ENAMEX>-Platz pay tribute to the city‚Äôs most famous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin-Gropius-Bau</ENAMEX>, situated nearby at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Stresemann Stra√üe 110</ENAMEX>, was originally built <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1877 and 1881</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin Gropius</ENAMEX> (great-uncle of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bauhaus‚Äôs Walter Gropius</ENAMEX>), with the help of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heino Schmieden</ENAMEX>, as an arts and crafts <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>. The lavish red and gold <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> is now a spacious exhibition <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">site housing</ENAMEX> art and architecture exhibits in and around its skylighted inner <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard area</ENAMEX>.
Adjacent to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin-Gropius-Bau</ENAMEX> is the site of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Prinz-Albrecht-Stra√üe 8</ENAMEX>, the former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">School of Applied Arts and Design</ENAMEX>, which served as the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SS, Gestapo</ENAMEX>, and other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Nazi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Excavations</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</TIMEX> revealed the cellars where <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> were imprisoned and tortured. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> constructed above the underground <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">quarters</TIMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guards</ENAMEX> houses the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Topographie des Terrors</ENAMEX>, an exhibition of photographs and documents which movingly illustrates the lives of those who resisted the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Nazi</ENAMEX> terror. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX> has many reminders of its dark past, but this has particular impact.
Further along at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Askanischer Platz</ENAMEX> is the sad but graceful arcaded ruin of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anhalter Bahnhof</ENAMEX>. By an irony of latterday history, the old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">railway station</ENAMEX> was the work of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Franz Schwechten</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX> who created the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church</ENAMEX>, that other noble ruin (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX>).
Mitte
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">area</ENAMEX> east of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Brandenburg Gate</ENAMEX> known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitte</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Middle</ENAMEX>) is the historic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX>, and was at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time the center of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">German Democratic Republic</ENAMEX>. The city‚Äôs most important <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">theaters</ENAMEX>, government <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX> were constructed here <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between the 18th and 20th centuries</TIMEX>. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>, including the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Friedrichswerdersche Kirche</ENAMEX> (now home to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schinkel-Museum</ENAMEX>, see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">58</NUMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schinkel‚Äôs Altes Museum</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Old Museum</ENAMEX>; see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">76</NUMEX>), were carefully restored by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East Germany</ENAMEX> after air-raid bombing of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several quarters</TIMEX> were rebuilt in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Old Berlin</ENAMEX> style, notably <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gendarmenmarkt</ENAMEX> (formerly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Platz der Akademie</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Museumsinsel</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">76</NUMEX>).
Today, the area‚Äôs principal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">avenue</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Unter den Linden</ENAMEX>, has regained its former importance as the main focus of the capital‚Äôs cultural and political life, while nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Friedrichstra√üe</ENAMEX> is once again becoming a fashionable shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">artery</ENAMEX>, with the opening of several new shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX>. When you talk to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> here, however, it‚Äôs worth bearing in mind that eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX> did not turn into a bastion of anti-Communism <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">overnight</TIMEX>. Although the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> voted in a conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mayor</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 1990</TIMEX>, the successor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Communists</ENAMEX> did exceptionally well in the old eastern boroughs, still a solid left-wing stronghold.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brandenburg Gate</ENAMEX>
In spite of it attracting occasional protest marches from those who support the political Far <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Right</TIMEX>, this formidable symbol of the united <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> generally appears at last to be realizing the vision of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Johann Gottfried Schadow</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sculptor</ENAMEX> who crowned the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Brandenburg Gate</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quadriga</ENAMEX>, a copper statue of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Winged Victory</ENAMEX> in her four-horse chariot. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schadow</ENAMEX> had wanted the gate to be known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Friedenstor</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gate of Peace</ENAMEX>), in keeping with the relief of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Procession of Peace</ENAMEX> that he himself had sculpted beneath <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Victory‚</ENAMEX>Äôs simple chariot.
The gate itself, designed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carl Gotthard Langhans</ENAMEX>, was built <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1789 and 1791</TIMEX>. With <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> rows of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Doric</ENAMEX> columns forming the gateway proper, it was inspired by the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Propylaeum</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">gatehouse</ENAMEX> leading to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parthenon</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX>. (To go all the way, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hitler</ENAMEX> had even planned to hoist the gate onto an artificial hill, in an attempt to create a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mini-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Acropolis</ENAMEX>.) Forming part of the city <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wall</ENAMEX>, the gate was intended by the more pragmatic <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prussians</ENAMEX> not so much as a triumphal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arch</ENAMEX> as an imposing tollgate for collecting duties.
The gate was left isolated in no-man‚Äôs land when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wall</ENAMEX> went up, and subsequently became the scene of quite ecstatic celebrations when it came down, though now you would scarcely believe it as Berliners cross nonchalantly from east to west through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brandenburg‚</ENAMEX>Äôs mighty central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arch</ENAMEX>.
The new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US Embassy</ENAMEX> is being built nearby, on land originally occupied by that country‚Äôs pre-war <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">embassy</ENAMEX>, and a large stretch of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ground</ENAMEX> leading towards <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Potsdamer Platz</ENAMEX> has been designated as the site of a memorial to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Holocaust</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Unter den Linden</ENAMEX>
Sweeping eastwards from the gate, this grand <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">61-m</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">200-ft</ENAMEX>) -wide <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">avenue</ENAMEX>, literally named <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚ÄúBeneath the Linden Trees</ENAMEX>,‚Äù was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berlin‚</ENAMEX>Äôs showcase <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">boulevard</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frederick the Great</ENAMEX> saw it as the center of his royal capital, and it became the most prestigious address in town. Some of its splendor fell victim to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> speculation, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">avenue</ENAMEX> remained fashionable until the bombs of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX> reduced it to rubble. Now the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> have been replanted and the most important <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> restored.
Its western <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">end</ENAMEX> is dominated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Russian Federation Embassy</ENAMEX> on the right as you come from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Brandenburg Gate</ENAMEX>. Close by is the smartest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>; the supremely elegant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hotel Adlon</ENAMEX> was recently built on the site of the original <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX> of the same name, which was a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">1930s Berlin</ENAMEX> legend.
Continuing east, you pass the unprepossessing modern fa√ßade of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Komische Oper</ENAMEX>, one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Berlin‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most important opera <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>. The ugly exterior is the result of post-war reconstruction; happily, the magnificently over-the-top original gilded interior has been retained.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East of Charlottenstra√üe</ENAMEX>, beyond the patched, dark stone of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deutsche Staatsbibliothek</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Library</ENAMEX>), built <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1903 and 1914</TIMEX> but damaged during the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War</ENAMEX>, is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frederick the Great‚</ENAMEX>Äôs architectural <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> known as <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚ÄúForum Fridericianum</ENAMEX>.‚Äù An imposing statue of the monarch on horseback (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1851</TIMEX>), the work of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christian Daniel Rauch</ENAMEX>, stands in the avenue‚Äôs central strip.
To recreate the cultural climate that his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandfather</ENAMEX> had brought to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th century</TIMEX>, the king commissioned a new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> to house the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Academy</ENAMEX>, a library, an opera <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>, and a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> for his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prince</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Heinrich</ENAMEX>. The result was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Heinrich‚Äôs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1748</TIMEX>), which is now beautifully restored and forms part of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Humboldt Universit√§t.</ENAMEX> Founded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1810</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brothers</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilhelm Humboldt</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX> counted among its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professors</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hegel</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Engels</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marx</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Einstein</ENAMEX>, as well as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grimm</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brothers</ENAMEX>. Opposite its rather severe classicism is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">curving Baroque fa√ßade</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alte Bibliothek</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Old Library</ENAMEX>). It stands beside the open square named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bebelplatz</ENAMEX> (formerly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Opernplatz</ENAMEX>) which was the scene of book-burning by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Nazi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1933</TIMEX>.
Across Bebelplatz you will find the grand <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Palladian</ENAMEX>-style <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deutsche Staatsoper</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Opera</ENAMEX>) designed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1742</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Knobelsdorff</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frederick the Great‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">favorite architect</ENAMEX>. To the east of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Operncaf√</ENAMEX>© is housed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prinzessinnenpalais</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Prussian princesses‚Äô Baroque</ENAMEX> town <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>. Its open-air <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terrace</ENAMEX> is one of the most popular places to meet in the eastern part of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX>, while inside there is an elegant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">caf√</ENAMEX>© and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX> to be enjoyed.
Beside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">university</ENAMEX>, the old <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Prussian</ENAMEX> army <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guardhouse</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Neue Wache</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Guardhouse</ENAMEX>), known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mahnmal</ENAMEX>, was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karl Friedrich Schinkel‚Äôs</ENAMEX> first important <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Neo</ENAMEX>-Classical design, completed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1818</TIMEX>. It was rebuilt at the end of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX> as a memorial to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fascism</ENAMEX> and militarism.
Next door is the handsome, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baroque Zeughaus</ENAMEX>, once <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">arsenal</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prussian Army</ENAMEX>, as the sculpted suits of armor testify along the roof. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andreas Schl√</ENAMEX>ºter provided the military sculpture, but was able to assert his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pacifist</ENAMEX> views with poignant sculpted masks of dying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">warriors</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1696</TIMEX>) in the inner <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX> named after him, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schl√ºterhof.</ENAMEX> Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1950s</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zeughaus</ENAMEX> has been home to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deutsches Historiches Museum</ENAMEX>. An extensive program of refurbishment is due to be finished by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late 2001</TIMEX>. In the meantime, the collection, which includes art and social history exhibits, can be found in the splendid <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kronprinzenpalais</ENAMEX>, located directly across <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Unter den Linden</ENAMEX>.
To the south of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Staatsoper</ENAMEX> on the corner of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. Hedwigs-Kathedrale</ENAMEX>, from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1747</TIMEX>, a huge, domed <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> built for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catholics</ENAMEX> incorporated into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Protestant Prussia</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Frederick‚</ENAMEX>Äôs conquest of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Polish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Silesia</ENAMEX>.
The celebrated architectural ensemble south of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Unter den Linden</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gendarmenmarkt</ENAMEX> has been almost completely restored after near total destruction during <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War</ENAMEX> II. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> is bordered by bookshops and caf√©s set in delightful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arcades</ENAMEX>. The imposing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schiller-Denkmal</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1868</TIMEX>), a monument sculpted in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Carrara</ENAMEX> marble, surrounds the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> with the muses of philosophy, poetry, drama, and history.
It stands in front of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schinkel‚Äôs Ionic-porticoed Konzerthaus</ENAMEX>. Originally called the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schauspielhaus</ENAMEX>, (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Playhouse</ENAMEX>), this is now a concert <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX>. The edifice links <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> identical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Franz√∂sischer Dom</ENAMEX> (or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">French Cathedral</ENAMEX>) to the north, built for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrant</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Huguenots</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Deutscher Dom</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cathedral</ENAMEX>) to the south. Both were built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 18th century</TIMEX>. The twin <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">domes</ENAMEX> were added in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1785</TIMEX>.
Step inside the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Franz√∂sischer Dom</ENAMEX> to visit the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Huguenot</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>, or look up the stairwell to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Glockenspiel¬†‚Äî¬†a dizzying 48 m</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">159 ft</ENAMEX>) above. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Turmstuben</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX> on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX> is the place to calm your shattered nerves. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Deutscher Dom</ENAMEX> now houses a fascinating exhibition, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fragen</ENAMEX> an die deutsche <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Geschichte</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> History Under Question), which was previously in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reichstag</ENAMEX>. This frank examination of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Germany‚</ENAMEX>Äôs social and political history cleverly combines documents, photographs, and radio broadcasts to chronicle the rise of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fascism</ENAMEX> and the development of democracy. The descriptive panels are all in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX>, but audio guides and information booklets are available in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>.
A short stroll leads to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Friedrichstra√üe</ENAMEX>, where <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">over 100,000 m</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">GDR</ENAMEX> architectural <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monstrosity</ENAMEX> have been demolished and replaced by a very elegant development of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">designer shops</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartments</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> √©lan has come to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX> in the form of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> of the famous department store, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Galeries Lafayette</ENAMEX>, at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Quartier 207</ENAMEX>. The sophisticated <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Art Deco</ENAMEX> styling of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quartier</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">206</ENAMEX>, home to some very exclusive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">designer boutiques</ENAMEX>, is the work of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Americans Pen</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Cobb</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Freed</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Partners</ENAMEX>.
Walking along <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Friedrichstra√üe</ENAMEX>, you can only marvel at the changes that have been made here since reunification. Nowhere is this brought home more strongly than at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Checkpoint Charlie</ENAMEX>, that infamous border crossing between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">East</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West</ENAMEX>. Today, the barbed wire and barriers are gone, but the memories remain, housed in the fascinat-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ing Haus am Checkpoint Charlie Museum</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Memories</ENAMEX> of human tragedy on an even wider scale can be found at the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">J√ºdisches Museum</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lindenstra√üe</ENAMEX>. Even the architecture has been designed to symbolize the devastation of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> life in the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Holocaust</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel Libeskind‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> was drawing huge crowds even before the exhibits of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> art and history were installed.
Oranienburger Stra√üe
On the north side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">River Spree</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oranienburger Stra√üe</ENAMEX> is the heart of the old <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Jewish quarter</TIMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1920s</TIMEX>, a diverse <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Bohemian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> lived, worked, and thrived here. After the devastation of the war and the grim sterility of its aftermath, the area has now regained much of its former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vibrancy</ENAMEX>, with cultural <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> rubbing shoulders with off-beat caf√©s and alternative art venues beneath the magnificent black-and-gold-leafed <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dome</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Neue Synagogue</ENAMEX>. The biggest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">synagogue</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>, designed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eduard Knoblauch</ENAMEX> and completed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1866</TIMEX>, it was gutted during the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-Semitic</ENAMEX> attacks of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kristallnacht</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9 November 1938</TIMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX>) and then later destroyed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Allied</ENAMEX> bombing. It has now been beautifully restored, and is used for services once more. In addition, exhibits from the adjacent <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">center</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> studies, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Centrum Judaicum</ENAMEX>, are displayed here.
Nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hackesche H√∂fe</ENAMEX> is a fascinating complex of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 20th century</TIMEX> interconnecting courtyards. This has recently been restored, and is now a lively spot, with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bars</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">art galleries</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>, complete with its own <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">theater</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karl-Liebknecht</ENAMEX>-Stra√üe
Linking <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Unter den Linden</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karl-Liebknecht-Stra√üe</ENAMEX> is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Schlo√übr√ºcke</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Palace Bridge</ENAMEX>), designed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schinkel</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1820‚Äì1824</NUMEX>, and decorated with fierce <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">warriors</ENAMEX> and victory goddesses. Beyond the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX>, look left to the imposing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Neo-Classical</ENAMEX> fa√ßade of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Altes Museum</ENAMEX> at the far end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lustgarten</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Pleasure Garden</ENAMEX>), which forms a grand entrance to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Museumsinsel</ENAMEX>, the site of eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Berlin‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most important <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">76</NUMEX>). On the opposite side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lustgarten</ENAMEX>, stands the area once more known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schlossplatz</ENAMEX>. Under the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">GDR</ENAMEX> its name was changed to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marx-Engels-Platz</ENAMEX>, and it became a focus of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Communist</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May Day</TIMEX> military parades and rallies. The war-damaged <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stadtschlo√ü</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">City Palace</ENAMEX>) of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hohenzollerns</ENAMEX> once stood here. However, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1950</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter Ulbricht</ENAMEX> decided to raze it as symbolizing <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> imperialism, despite protests from art <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">historians</ENAMEX> that it was the city‚Äôs outstanding Baroque <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>. (You can see a model of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> in the historical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartments</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schlo√ü Charlottenburg</ENAMEX>, see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55</NUMEX>.)
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace balcony</ENAMEX> from which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spartacist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karl Liebknecht</ENAMEX> proclaimed his <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">doomed ‚ÄúSocialist Republic‚Äù</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1918</TIMEX> was added to the front of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Staatsrat</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Council of State</ENAMEX>) building on the east side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>, while the monstrous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bronze</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glass</ENAMEX>, and steel <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palast der Republik</ENAMEX>, once, not so very long ago, the seat of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East Germany‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parliament</ENAMEX>, replaced what remained of the royal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX>. Recent budget cuts have postponed the demolition of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palast</ENAMEX>, and there is a movement afoot to preserve it as an historic monument.
On the opposite side, the exterior of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kaiser Wilhelm II‚Äôs Berliner Dom</ENAMEX> has been completely restored, and its interior beautifully renovated, despite sustaining heavy bomb damage during the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War</ENAMEX>. The cathedral acts as a place of worship as well as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>, and has a crypt containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">95</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hohenzollern</ENAMEX> sarcophagi.
Continue along <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Karl-Liebknecht-Stra√üe</ENAMEX> as far as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marienkirche</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13th century</TIMEX>) on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Neuer Markt</ENAMEX>, a haven of sober Gothic simplicity amid the prevailing bombast. Inside, see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schl√ºter‚Äôs Baroque</ENAMEX> marble pulpit (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1703</TIMEX>) and a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late-Gothic</TIMEX> fresco of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dance of Death</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1484</TIMEX>) in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower hall</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Neo-Renaissance Berliner Rathaus</ENAMEX>, also known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rotes Rathaus</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Red Town Hall</ENAMEX>), owes its nickname to its red clinker masonry, not its ideology. Built <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1861 and 1869</TIMEX>, it is now the seat of the city‚Äôs governing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mayor</ENAMEX>, and is decorated with an interesting terracotta frieze chronicling the history of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX> up to the time of the building‚Äôs construction.
Beyond the huge <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Neptunbrunnen</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Neptune‚Äôs Fountain</ENAMEX>), a rather elaborate affair decorated with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">figures</ENAMEX> representing the rivers <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rhine</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Elbe, Oder</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weichsel</ENAMEX>, you can hardly miss the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fernsehturm</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Television Tower</ENAMEX>) rising up above <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alexanderplatz</ENAMEX>. It was built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1969</TIMEX>, and at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">365 m</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,197 ft</NUMEX>) absolutely dwarfs western <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin‚Äôs Funkturm</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">59</NUMEX>), which was the object of the exercise. Not for the fainthearted, an observation deck at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">207 m</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">679 ft</ENAMEX>) affords an excellent view over the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, while the revolving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX> provides refreshment.
Alexanderplatz
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúAlex</ENAMEX>,‚Äù as the huge <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> is known, was once the undisputed heart of pre-war <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX>, and its vibrancy was celebrated in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alfred D√∂blin‚</ENAMEX>Äôs great <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1929</TIMEX> novel <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Berlin Alexanderplatz</ENAMEX>, later filmed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rainer Werner Fassbinder</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> is a rather bleak and desolate place with a fountain and a circular <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World Clock</ENAMEX>, surrounded by grim, graffiti-ridden <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Communist</ENAMEX> architecture. However, plans are afoot to knock down and rebuild part of the area and restore some of the square‚Äôs former vitality.
The crumbling fa√ßades of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartments</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX>, and bargain basement <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> line <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karl-Marx-Allee</ENAMEX> leading southeast from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alex.</ENAMEX> Walk up and down it if only to remind yourself what soulless <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Stalinist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architects</ENAMEX> could produce. Until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1961</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> was known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stalin-Allee</ENAMEX>.
To the north of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alexanderplatz</ENAMEX>, behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Volksb√ºhne</ENAMEX> theater, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sch√∂nhauser Allee</ENAMEX> is one of the most characteristic avenues of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Old Berlin</ENAMEX> leading to the center of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prenzlauer Berg</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th century</TIMEX> working-class <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">quarter¬</ENAMEX>†‚Äî¬†now a lively, bohemian area with colorful nightlife. On <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Husemannstra√üe</ENAMEX>, a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> from the age of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kaiser Wilhelm II</ENAMEX> have been pleasingly restored.
Nikolaiviertel
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South of the Rotes Rathaus</ENAMEX>, the neighborhood of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nikolai</ENAMEX> was restored for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Berlin‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">750th</NUMEX> anniversary celebrations in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</TIMEX>, as a ‚Äúclean‚Äù example of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Old Berlin</ENAMEX>. The site of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Berlin‚</ENAMEX>Äôs earliest settlement, it clusters around the city‚Äôs oldest parish <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>, the twin-steepled <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gothic</ENAMEX>-style <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nikolaikirche</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> was built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1230</TIMEX> and now forms part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M√§rkisches Museum</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">79</NUMEX>), devoted to the city‚Äôs history. Among the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> resurrected here is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gastst√</ENAMEX>§tte zum <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nu√übaum</ENAMEX>, the favorite <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tavern</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cartoonist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Heinrich Zille</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Knoblauchhaus</ENAMEX>, at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Poststra√üe 23</NUMEX>, is an elegant house rebuilt in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Neo-Classical</ENAMEX> style in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1835</TIMEX> and containing some fine <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Biedermeier</ENAMEX> furniture. More stately is the reconstructed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ephraimpalais</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Poststra√üe</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>, a rococo <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansion</ENAMEX> built for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Friedrich II‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">financier</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Veitel Heine Ephraim</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1765</TIMEX>. Besides providing a delightful setting for chamber-music recitals, it is also used for exhibitions of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th- and 19th-century</TIMEX> art and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX> history.
Schlo√ü Charlottenburg
The carefully restored <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX>, an exemplary piece of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prussian Baroque</ENAMEX> and rococo architecture and decoration, is the city‚Äôs only surviving major <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hohenzollern</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX>. To do the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX>, grounds, and surrounding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX> full justice, you will need to spend <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least a day</TIMEX> here.
Badly damaged in a <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX> air raid, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schlo√ü Charlottenburg</ENAMEX> became the target of extensive post-war reconstruction, and now functions as a major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> complex. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Galerie</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">der</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Romantik</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Gallery of Romantic Art</ENAMEX>) and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum</ENAMEX> f√ºr <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vor- und Fr√ºhgeschichte</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum of Primeval</ENAMEX> and Early History) are housed in the east and west wings respectively, while the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sammlung Berggruen</ENAMEX> (a collection of contemporary art) and the √Ñgyptisches <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Egyptian Museum</ENAMEX>) are in identical guardhouses opposite the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX>. You will find the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Br√∂han Museum</ENAMEX> (dedicated to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Art Deco</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Art Nouveau</ENAMEX>) in a former infantry <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">barracks</ENAMEX> opposite the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Egyptian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>. A detailed description of each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> is given on page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">68</NUMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schlo√ü Charlottenburg</ENAMEX> was conceived as a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> retreat for the future <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Queen Sophie Charlotte</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1690s</TIMEX>, when the site beside the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">River Spree</ENAMEX>, west of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tiergarten</ENAMEX>, lay well outside the city limits. It was a small palace¬†‚Äî¬†scarcely <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one-fifth</NUMEX> of the huge structure you see <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">today¬†‚Äî¬†and</ENAMEX> only with the addition of a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">majestic domed tower</ENAMEX> (with the goddess <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fortune</ENAMEX> as its weathervane), the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Orangerie</ENAMEX> to the west and a new east <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX>, did it become big enough for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frederick the Great</ENAMEX>. If he ever had to leave his beloved <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Potsdam</ENAMEX>, this was where he came.
In the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace courtyard</ENAMEX> you will find an equestrian statue of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Great Elector Friedrich Wilhelm</ENAMEX>, designed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andreas Schl√</ENAMEX>ºter in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1697</TIMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of many art works lost in <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX>, it was finally recovered from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Tegel Lake</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1949</TIMEX>, where it had sunk with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">barge</ENAMEX> that was taking it to safety.
To try and recapture the interior‚Äôs rather gracious rococo atmosphere, furniture and decorations from other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Prussian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palaces</ENAMEX> built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 18th-century</TIMEX> have been used to replace what was destroyed here during <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War</ENAMEX> II.
In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gobelinzimmer</ENAMEX>, notice the fine <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th-century</TIMEX> tapestries by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Vigne</ENAMEX>. The rays of light on the ceiling of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Audienzzimmer</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reception Room</ENAMEX>) and bright yellow damask walls in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schlafzimmer</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedroom</ENAMEX>) imitate the motif of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sun King</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Louis XIV</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prussian</ENAMEX> rulers‚Äô <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hero</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chinoiserie</ENAMEX> is the dominating feature of the opulent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Porzellankabinett</ENAMEX>, filled to the ceiling with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of pieces of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">porcelain</ENAMEX>. The relatively sober <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Japanische Kammer</ENAMEX> contains some prized lacquered cabinets and tables. The tapestries depict landscapes of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>, in spite of the chamber‚Äôs name. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chamber</ENAMEX> music recitals can be heard in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eichengalerie</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oak Gallery</ENAMEX>) and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eosander-Kapelle</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">chapel</ENAMEX>) which boasts an extravagant rococo decor that makes it more a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">theater</ENAMEX> than a place of worship.
Designed for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frederick the Great</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Georg von Knobelsdorff</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Neuer Fl√ºgel</ENAMEX> (new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX>, also the east <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX>) subtly combines dignified late-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baroque</ENAMEX> fa√ßades with exuberant rococo interiors. Part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ground floor</ENAMEX> is given over to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Galerie</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">der</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Romantik</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">69</NUMEX>), which boasts the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prussian</ENAMEX> monarchy‚Äôs collection of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19th-century</TIMEX> art. The ceremonial staircase which leads to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frederick the Great‚</ENAMEX>Äôs state <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartments</ENAMEX> has an abstract modern ceiling fresco by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hann Trier</ENAMEX> in place of the original decor which was destroyed by fire. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trier</ENAMEX> also painted the ceiling of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wei√üe Saal</ENAMEX> (throne <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> and banquet <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX>).
The finest achievement of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Knobelsdorff</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schlo√ü Charlottenburg</ENAMEX> is the splendid <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42</NUMEX>-m- (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">138-ft-</ENAMEX>) long <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goldene Galerie</ENAMEX>. This rococo <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ballroom</ENAMEX> with its marble walls, dripping with gilded stucco, leads to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> containing a fine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Watteau</ENAMEX> paintings. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frederick the Great</ENAMEX> was somewhat amused by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> artist‚Äôs insolent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enseigne du Gersaint</ENAMEX>, a shop sign for art <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gersaint</ENAMEX>, in which a portrait of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Louis XIV</ENAMEX> is being packed away rather unceremoniously. Among various other superb works by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Watteau</ENAMEX>, you will find <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L‚</ENAMEX>Äôamour paisible (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Quiet Love</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Les Bergers</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Shepherds</ENAMEX>).
Take a break for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX> or lunch at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Orangerie</ENAMEX>, then head off and explore the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schlo√üpark</ENAMEX>. Among the many <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> in the grounds, nearest to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Italian-style Schinkel-Pavillon</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1825</TIMEX>). As well as a collection of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schinkel‚</ENAMEX>Äôs drawings and plans, the building contains <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 19th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX> paintings and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">porcelain</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Upstairs</ENAMEX>, take a look at an amusing <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">panorama</ENAMEX> of 1830s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eduard Gaertner</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North</ENAMEX> of the carp pond, the elegant <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Belvedere</ENAMEX>, once a teahouse, now houses a collection of quite exquisite <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th- and 19th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">porcelain</ENAMEX>.
West of Charlottenburg
Built for the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Games of 1936</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hitler‚Äôs Olympiastadion</ENAMEX> was spared bombardment to serve as <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Army</ENAMEX>. The structure‚Äôs bombastic gigantism is an eloquent testimony to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">F√</ENAMEX>ºhrer‚Äôs taste in architecture. Viewed from the main <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Olympic Gate</ENAMEX>, it appears to be very ‚Äúlow slung‚Äù until you see inside that the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">field</ENAMEX> itself has been sunk <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">12 m</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> ft) below ground level. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">76,000</NUMEX>-capacity <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stadium</ENAMEX> still stages sporting events, and from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May through October</TIMEX> is open <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX>, except on event <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>. It is currently undergoing extensive refurbishment in preparation for its role as the venue for the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">2006 Soccer World Cup Final</ENAMEX>.
To the west of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stadium</ENAMEX>, take the lift up the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Glockenturm</ENAMEX> (bell <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX>) for a magnificent view over the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Olympic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">site</ENAMEX>. Beyond the bell <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX>, a pathway will lead you to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Waldb√ºhne</ENAMEX>, an open-air amphitheater which is a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> venue for concerts and films.
On <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Messedamm</ENAMEX> southeast of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stadium</ENAMEX>, stands another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">colossus</ENAMEX>, the famous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICC</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Congress Center</ENAMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the biggest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">convention centers</ENAMEX> in the world, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> is also used for staging cultural events. Next to it on the equally huge <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Messe und Ausstellungsgel√§nde</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trade Fair</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Exhibition Area</ENAMEX>), the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Funkturm</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Radio Tower</ENAMEX>) is positively tiny¬<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">†‚Äî¬†150 m</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">492 ft</ENAMEX>) to the tip of its antenna, half the height of eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Berlin‚Äôs Television Tower</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">53</NUMEX>). For breathtaking views, take the elevator to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">55 m</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">180 ft</ENAMEX>) up, or to the observation platform all the way at the top.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Outskirts</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northeast of Charlottenburg</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gedenkst√§tte Pl√∂tzensee</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">H√</ENAMEX>ºttigpfad is a stark and moving memorial to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Nazi</ENAMEX> persecution (take bus 123 from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S-Bahn Tiergarten</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pl√∂tzensee</ENAMEX>). On the opposite side of the road a lane leads to the site of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prison</ENAMEX> where <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> were tortured and executed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1933 and 1945</TIMEX>, including many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> involved in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stauffenberg</ENAMEX> plot.
The dark sheds where executions were carried out have been preserved, and outside a stone <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">urn</ENAMEX>, filled with soil from concentration <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camps</ENAMEX>, stands in a corner of the paved <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">yard</ENAMEX>. In one of the sheds you will find a small and poignant exhibition of historical documents which includes death warrants and pictures of leading <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX>. There is an information <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> where you can obtain free booklets in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grunewald</ENAMEX> and Wannsee
On the western edge of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX>, the dense pine forest which was largely stripped for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fuel</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1945</TIMEX>, has been replanted, adding to the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">18 million pines around 6 million chestnut</NUMEX>, linden, beech, birch, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">oak trees</ENAMEX>. The lush wooded areas form a reserve for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">deer</ENAMEX>, wild boar, marten, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">foxes</ENAMEX>, and rabbits, but there are also plenty of green meadows for picnics, and the forest paths are extremely popular with both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cyclists</ENAMEX> and joggers.
The easiest and most direct way to get to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grunewald</ENAMEX> is to take the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S-Bahn</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bahnhof Zoo</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grunewald S-Bahn</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX>. Alternatively, you could combine your trip with a visit to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dahlem¬†‚Äî¬†the Br√ºcke Museum</ENAMEX> is only a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20-minute</TIMEX> walk from the eastern edge of the forest. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Drivers</ENAMEX> take the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avus</ENAMEX> and turn off on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H√</ENAMEX>ºttenweg to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Grunewaldsee</ENAMEX>, a lake offering swimming and sandy beaches. On the east shore, in an attractive lakeside setting of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">beech trees</ENAMEX>, you will find the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jagdschlo√ü Grunewald</ENAMEX>, a hunting lodge built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1542</TIMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prince</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elector Joachim</ENAMEX> II. Situated in a cobbled <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX>, the lodge has been restored to its original <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> appearance.
Inside is displayed a rather curious collection of early <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> hunting portraits and landscapes, among which can be found some remarkable paintings, in particular a series of panels depicting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Passion Cycle</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lucas Cranach</ENAMEX>. Other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> works of note are those by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jordaens</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rubens</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bruyn</ENAMEX>.
There are marvelous views over the lake from the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>- and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>-floor <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX>, and the period porcelain, furniture, and wooden floors add rustic charm. The nominal admission charge includes entry to the small hunting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jagdmuseum</ENAMEX>) on the opposite side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX>. A short walk down the path outside the lodge brings you to the rather grand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Forsthaus Paulsborn</ENAMEX>, where you can dine in splendor overlooking the lake.
On the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grunewald‚</ENAMEX>Äôs west side, along <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Havelchaussee</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grunewaldturm</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grunewald Tower</ENAMEX>) is a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Neo-Gothic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1897</TIMEX> to commemorate <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 100th birthday</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilhelm I.</ENAMEX> You can climb the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">205</NUMEX> steps to reach the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55</NUMEX>-m- (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">180-ft-</ENAMEX> ) high observation platform for views as far as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Potsdam</ENAMEX>. Ferry <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stations</ENAMEX> in the area offer boat rides on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">River Havel</ENAMEX> and forest lakes, and the east <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Havel</ENAMEX> is lined with sandy beaches as far as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wannsee</ENAMEX> lakes.
The waterfront near <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wannsee S-Bahn</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">station</ENAMEX> is a crowded spot where <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dwellers</ENAMEX> come and let their hair down on warm <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">spring</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer days</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> bustles with pleasure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> and ferries, and you can cruise all the way to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spandau</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Potsdam</ENAMEX> from here. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Strandbad Wannsee</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Berlin‚</ENAMEX>Äôs biggest beach, and the longest inland one in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>.
West of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gro√üer Wannsee</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">K√∂nigstra√üe crosses Berliner</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Forst</ENAMEX>, an extension of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grunewald</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Glienicke Park</ENAMEX>. Its whimsical landscaping of little hills, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridges</ENAMEX>, and ponds was the work of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Josef Lenn√</ENAMEX>© in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 19th century</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schlo√ü Glienicke</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1828</TIMEX>) is a rather austere <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Neo-Classical</ENAMEX> edifice, but the nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cloister</ENAMEX>, villa, and garden <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> add a romantic touch.
A ferry links <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pfaueninsel</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Peacock Island</ENAMEX>), a delightfully tranquil nature reserve in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Havel</ENAMEX>, towards the northern edge of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berliner</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Forst</ENAMEX>. The island menagerie was used to stock the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Berlin Zoo</ENAMEX>, but the bird <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">sanctuary</ENAMEX> still has much to offer the nature-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lover</ENAMEX> including, of course, peacocks.
At the southern tip, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> hidden in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>, is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schinkel‚Äôs Swiss Cottage</ENAMEX>, but the island‚Äôs principal curiosity is the fake ruin <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schlo√ü Pfaueninsel</ENAMEX>, built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1797</TIMEX> as a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hideaway</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Friedrich Wilhelm II</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lover</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Countess Wilhelmine von Lichtenau</ENAMEX>. The white wooden <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fa√ßade imitates granite</ENAMEX> blocks, and the delightful turrets are joined together at the top by a pretty bridge.
K√∂nigsstra√üe extends as far as an illustrious relic of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Cold War</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Glienicker Bridge</ENAMEX>, once a restricted border crossing between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Berlin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East Germany</ENAMEX> where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KGB</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> exchanged <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spies</ENAMEX>.
Spandau
With a history longer than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Berlin‚Äôs</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spandau</ENAMEX>, northwest of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX>, still remains fiercely independent-minded, and was the most reluctant of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">townships</ENAMEX> to be annexed by the metropolis in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1920</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> is easily reached by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U-Bahn</ENAMEX> and, if you have time to spare, is well worth visiting for its old restored <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">quarter</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">citadel</ENAMEX>, the venue for regular <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> festivals of jazz and classical music.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Altstadt</ENAMEX> (old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>) was less damaged by bombing than the rest of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX>, and has been restored to much of its former charm. You will see pretty, gabled <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> fa√ßades, and even traces of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 14th-century</TIMEX> town <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wall</ENAMEX> along <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hoher Steinweg</ENAMEX>, east of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Falkenseer Platz</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Spandauers</ENAMEX> claim that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. Nikolaikirche</ENAMEX>, situated at the heart of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reformationsplatz</ENAMEX>, is where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prince</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joachim II</ENAMEX> converted to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Protestantism</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Gothic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> has an imposing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> altar.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">The 16th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zitadelle</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">citadel</ENAMEX>), in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">River Havel</ENAMEX>, was the scene of heavy fighting in the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Napoleonic Wars</ENAMEX>. Its walls enclose the old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Juliusturm</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> keep from prior medieval fortifications. It was the repository for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX> coins paid by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> as reparations after the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Franco</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Prussian War</ENAMEX>, and returned as part payment for reparations following <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">I. The Heimatmuseum</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Local History Museum</ENAMEX>) in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Zitadelle</ENAMEX> contains an exhibition of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gravestones</ENAMEX>, found during excavations here, which date back to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 13th century</TIMEX>. A mock medieval <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tavern</ENAMEX> within offers good, solid fare in authentic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">surroundings</ENAMEX>.
If you‚Äôre thinking of looking for it, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">don‚Äôt¬†‚Äî¬†the</ENAMEX> famous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Spandau</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prison</ENAMEX> was razed to the ground to make way for the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> of a community center after the death in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</TIMEX> of its last (and latterly sole) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inmate</ENAMEX>, convicted war-criminal <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rudolf Hess</ENAMEX>.
To the north of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">borough</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spandauer Forst</ENAMEX> is half the size of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grunewald</ENAMEX>, but equally beautiful. The forest contains nature reserves where you will find rare <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> protected in their wild <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. Teufelsbruch, for example, which regularly records the coldest <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> temperatures in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX>, provides a natural shelter for <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">shrubs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> from the sub-<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Arctic</ENAMEX> tundra. Just to the east of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Teufelsbruch</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> bathing and camping are popular at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">B√ºrgerablage</ENAMEX> beach on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Havel</ENAMEX>.
K√∂penick
With its delightful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Altstadt</ENAMEX> (old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>) of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th- and 19th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">borough</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K√∂penick</ENAMEX> lies on the southern outskirts of eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX>, and is easily accessible by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S-Bahn</ENAMEX> line <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">S3</NUMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> is rapidly becoming a fashionable place to live, and many of its crumbling old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> have been restored. Affluent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> have opened their doors, and there are plenty of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, caf√©s, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">art galleries</ENAMEX>.
Like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spandau</ENAMEX> in the west, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K√∂penick</ENAMEX> has a longer history than <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX> itself, having been a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Slav</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">settlement</ENAMEX> on an island in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Spree</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 9th century</TIMEX>. It has a similarly independent-minded history. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Socialist</ENAMEX> before the proclamation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Weimar Republic</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> led the counter-assault which put an end to the right-wing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kapp Putsch</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1920</TIMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>). Resistance to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hitler</ENAMEX> by the town‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 1933</TIMEX> resulted in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K√∂penicker Blutwoche</ENAMEX> (bloodbath) in which storm-troopers killed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">91</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>. A memorial to the event is in the former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prussian</ENAMEX> official <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">jail</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Puchanstra√üe</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>.
To reach <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schlo√ü K√∂penick</ENAMEX> take tram <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">86</TIMEX> along <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Bahnhofstra√üe</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schlo√üplatz</ENAMEX>. The magnificent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> occupies its own little island in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">River Dahme</ENAMEX>, and is the occasional setting for open-air summer concerts.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> houses a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kunstgewerbemuseum</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arts and Crafts Museum</ENAMEX>), which is not quite as impressive as its counterpart in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tiergarten</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39</NUMEX>), but notable for a superb collection of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Meissen</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">porcelain</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medieval gold</ENAMEX> jewelry, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venetian</ENAMEX> glass and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th-century</TIMEX> rococo furniture. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> is closed for refurbishment until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>.

Although its collection was depleted both by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hitler‚Äôs</ENAMEX> assault on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Entartete Kunst</ENAMEX> (degenerate art) and the ravages of war, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>, which has undergone extensive renovations, has some interesting <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> works of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th and 20th centuries</TIMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blechen, Waldm√ºller</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slevogt, Liebermann</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Flax Workers</ENAMEX> and portraits of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilhelm von Bode</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Strauss</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Von Menzel‚Äôs Eisenwalzwerk</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Iron Foundry</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1875</TIMEX>) is a striking portrayal of industrial labor, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oskar Kokoschka‚Äôs</ENAMEX> painting, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pariser Platz</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1926</TIMEX>), recalls the bustle around the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Brandenburg Gate</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the twenties</TIMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deutsche</ENAMEX> Guggenheim

Pergamonmuseum
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">home</ENAMEX> of many impressive works of classical antiquity, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Near East</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Islam</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Orient</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> is named after its most prized possession: the gigantic <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pergamon Altar</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2nd century</TIMEX> b.c.). This masterpiece of Hellenistic art comes from what is now <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bergama</ENAMEX>, near the west coast of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Turkey</ENAMEX>. The massive colonnaded altar, which is dedicated to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zeus</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Athena</ENAMEX>, has been constructed to fill <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Babylonian Processional Street</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">604‚Äì562 b.c.</ENAMEX>), built by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nebuchadnezzar II</ENAMEX>, is equally impressive. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Lions sculpted</ENAMEX> in relief stride along the street‚Äôs blue-and- ochre tiled walls towards the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Ishtar Gate</ENAMEX>. The gate itself is decorated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bulls</ENAMEX> and dragons, also in blue-and-ochre tile.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">A third</NUMEX> great treasure is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> Market gate of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Miletus</ENAMEX>, from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asia Minor</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">a.d. 165</ENAMEX>). Its name belies the true <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> of this elaborately pedimented monument, which constitutes both gateway and shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Islamic Museum</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">Pergamon‚Äôs</ENAMEX> south wing exhibits the grand fa√ßade of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 8th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Palace of Mshatta</ENAMEX> (from what is now modern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jordan</ENAMEX>). It is embellished with intricately incised or perforated animal and plant motifs. In fact, a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> art <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">historian</ENAMEX> rescued this tour de force of early <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Islamic</ENAMEX> decoration at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the turn of the century</TIMEX> by persuading the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sultan</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Turkey</ENAMEX> not to use it as building <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">material</ENAMEX> for a railway link to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mecca</ENAMEX>. He made quite a save! Among the other precious exhibits you will find some exquisite <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indian Mogul</ENAMEX> miniatures.

Babelsberg
The small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">suburb</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Babelsberg</ENAMEX>, to the east of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Potsdam</ENAMEX>, was home to the film industry which rivaled <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1920s</TIMEX>. Classics such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fritz Lang‚Äôs Metropolis</ENAMEX> were made here. Now run as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">studio</ENAMEX> and adventure <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Filmpark Babelsberg organizes</ENAMEX> guided tours.

For want of a fitting statue to the great <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observatory staff</ENAMEX> have placed in the entrance <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX>, as a splendidly atrocious visual pun, a simple small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stone¬</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">†‚Äî¬†Ein Stein</ENAMEX>.
