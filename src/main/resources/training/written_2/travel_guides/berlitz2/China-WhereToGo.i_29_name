Where to Go
The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX> most-visited <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> and sights in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>, described in detail in this section, are arranged in alphabetical order. This conveniently puts the capital, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX>, first. The names of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> are given in official <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pinyin</ENAMEX> spelling. (To the right of each place name, we also provide the spelling by which it was known in the old <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wade-Giles</ENAMEX> system of romanization: for example, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">‚ÄúPeking‚Äù</ENAMEX> instead of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚ÄúBeijing</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äù</ENAMEX>) The authentic <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> for each place name are provided in a list at the back of this guide along with pronunciation guides (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">251</NUMEX>). At the end of this extended gazetteer, we provide ‚ÄúBriefings‚Äù on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> additional <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> and sights that are less frequently visited on typical tours.
Planning Your Trip
Choosing an itinerary can be a difficult task, for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> is too big to be covered in any reasonable amount of time. An excessively hasty week might take in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ming Tombs</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Great Wall</ENAMEX>; the archaeological marvels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xi‚Äôan</ENAMEX>; the romantic scenery of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Guilin</ENAMEX>; and a glimpse of bustling <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shanghai</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guangzhou</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canton</ENAMEX>). This sort of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">trip¬†‚Äî¬†though</ENAMEX> you leap around more often than is convenient¬†‚Äî¬†takes you to the top attractions.
Less taxing would be a week in and around <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shanghai</ENAMEX>, emphasizing the legendary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">charms</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wuxi, Suzhou</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hangzhou</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">All three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> are on the historic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Grand Canal</ENAMEX>.
If you go inland, you can still take the celebrated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four-day</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> trip between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wuhan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chongqing</ENAMEX> through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yangzi</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Yangtze) River gorges</ENAMEX> (before they are swallowed up by a massive dam project to be completed after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2009</TIMEX>), and from there fly to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shanghai</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guangzhou</ENAMEX> for sightseeing, shopping, and gourmet dining.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Silk Road</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enthusiasts</ENAMEX> fly from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xi‚</ENAMEX>Äôan to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Urumqi</ENAMEX> in the far west, returning via the exotic desert oases of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Turpan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dunhuang</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX> cave treasures and camel rides to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sand</ENAMEX>-locked lakes.
Another western <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> adventure is a visit to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yunnan Province</ENAMEX>, whose capital, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kunming</ENAMEX>, is home to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of most of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China‚Äôs</ENAMEX> minority <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. Near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kunming</ENAMEX> are the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stone Forest</ENAMEX>, a natural monument of bizarre formations, and to the northwest, near the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Tibetan</ENAMEX> border, the dazzling minority <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dali</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lijiang</ENAMEX>. 
If you prefer to stay close to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX>, the better part of a varied week could profitably be spent investigating the carvings of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX> caves near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Datong</ENAMEX>, visiting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mongolian</ENAMEX> lands of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hohhot</ENAMEX>, and viewing the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Tibetan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">temples</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chengde</ENAMEX>.
Any <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of these week-long <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segments</ENAMEX> can be combined for a fortnight‚Äôs touring. The most popular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">itineraries</ENAMEX> invariably include <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xi‚Äôan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Guilin</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shanghai</ENAMEX>, each <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> providing a glimpse of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> past and present.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Peking</ENAMEX>)
A visit to the medieval and modern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> is an exhausting though rewarding round of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palaces</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX>, temples and monuments, and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stores¬†‚Äî¬†a jolting</ENAMEX> juxtaposition of imperial pomp and contemporary energy.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> has a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">over 12 million</NUMEX>, but it is spread over a huge area calculated at a staggering <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">16,800 square km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 6,500 square miles</NUMEX>). Many neighborhoods are lined with old hutongs (alleyways) alongside traditional <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>- and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-story <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard houses</ENAMEX>, where life has changed little since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the days</TIMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qing Dynasty</ENAMEX>. Around the corner from these fast-disappearing cozy <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">alleys</ENAMEX> are new housing projects, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>, modern shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plazas</ENAMEX>, and open-air markets. This is a metropolis in the throes of modernization.
Mostly the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> is flat, which is a mercy for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> who bicycle to work in the world‚Äôs most unlikely <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">rush hour</TIMEX>, a chaos of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">buses</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trucks</ENAMEX> and more <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bikes</ENAMEX> than you‚Äôve seen in your whole life. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> took the unthinkable step of actually banning <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bikes</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Xisidonglu</ENAMEX>, where bicycle flow had reached <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 100</NUMEX> per minute.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Middle Ages</TIMEX>, the emperors decided to do something about the capital‚Äôs unrelieved flatness. They ordered hills to be artificially constructed just north of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Forbidden City</ENAMEX> so they could go up and, in total privacy, enjoy a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> breeze and a bird‚Äôs-eye view over the curved tile roofs of their imperial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">compound</ENAMEX>. Try it yourself, perhaps at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">dawn</TIMEX>, when a thin haze drapes itself over the pavilions, redefining yet softening the features of this storybook skyline. You‚Äôll see why the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emperors</ENAMEX> wanted it all for themselves.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> in History
Not far from the present-day suburbs of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> was the habitat of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Peking Man</ENAMEX>, the startling <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">anthropological</ENAMEX> discovery of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1920s</TIMEX>. A <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cave</ENAMEX> near the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zhoukoudian</ENAMEX> held the skull of a small-brained but upright ancestor of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mankind</ENAMEX> who lived <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half a million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Scientists</ENAMEX> are still sifting for the bones, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> can tour the dig themselves.
Recent excavations in downtown <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> show that it was inhabited over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20,000 years ago</TIMEX>, but the place made little stir until the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Warring States</ENAMEX> period (<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> centuries b.c.) when, known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jicheng</ENAMEX>, it became the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kingdom of Yan</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Renamed Yanjing</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> served as capital for the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Liao Dynasty in the tenth century a.d. The Jin</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chin</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dynasty</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 12th century</TIMEX> called it <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Zhongdu (‚ÄúCentral Capital‚Äù</ENAMEX>) and built an imperial palace as well as the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lugou Bridge</ENAMEX>; known abroad as the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">‚ÄúMarco Polo Bridge</ENAMEX>,‚Äù it is still in use.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genghis Khan‚Äôs Mongol</ENAMEX> armies leveled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zhongdu</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 13th century</TIMEX>, then rebuilt it under the name <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Dadu (‚ÄúGreat Capital‚Äù</ENAMEX>). By the time <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marco Polo</ENAMEX> arrived, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> outshone the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capitals</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ming Dynasty</ENAMEX> transferred most of the imperial pomp south to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nanjing</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 14th century</TIMEX>. Predictably, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dadu</ENAMEX> received yet another name, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beiping (‚ÄúNorthern Peace‚Äù</ENAMEX>) but had to wait <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than 50 years</TIMEX> to win back its imperial status and a fresh name. This one¬<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">†‚Äî¬†Beijing (‚ÄúNorthern Capital‚Äù)¬†‚Äî¬†is</ENAMEX> still around. So, happily, are the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Ming</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palaces</ENAMEX> and temples.
At the beginning of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qing Dynasty</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> prospered. New <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palaces</ENAMEX> and gardens were laid out and scholarship flourished. But during the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Boxer Rebellion of 1900</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">armies</ENAMEX> wrought havoc in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> in retaliation for the siege of their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">embassies</ENAMEX>. This was only the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of many crises which were to rock <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX>: the fall of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">foundation</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Republic</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> world wars, and civil war. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1949</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> became the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> of the new <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">People‚Äôs Republic of China</ENAMEX>.
Sightseeing
The historic heart of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> consists of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> concentric <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>, rectangular and symmetrical, and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fourth¬†‚Äî¬†Outer City¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†to the south. Most of the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">miles</NUMEX> of walls that protected each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> have been lost to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúprogress,‚Äù but the innermost, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Forbidden City</ENAMEX>, still glitters behind its original fortifications.
The elegance of this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> plan, basically <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">700 years old</TIMEX>, has never been surpassed. A precise north-south axis links the main elements, from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bell Tower</ENAMEX> all the way to the gate of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Outer City</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">8 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 miles</NUMEX>) to the south. At the center of it all is the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Forbidden City</ENAMEX>, imperial heart of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Middle Kingdom</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Tiananmen Square</ENAMEX> 
Called the biggest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plaza</ENAMEX> on earth, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Tiananmen Square</ENAMEX> covers <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">40 hectares</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100 acres</NUMEX>) in the very center of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> was the center of world attention during the student demonstrations of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX> and their tragic aftermath. In contrast, it is now the site of frequent festivities, with magnificent flower displays and sparkling fountains.
At the time of the emperors, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only about one-fourth</NUMEX> its present size. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the old</TIMEX>, less expansive square <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mao Zedong</ENAMEX> first raised the flag of the new <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 October 1949</TIMEX>. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 October 1999</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">People‚Äôs Republic</ENAMEX> celebrated its golden anniversary, each of the square‚Äôs concrete blocks freshly replaced by stately <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">granite</ENAMEX>. 
The newest building on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>, called the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mao Zedong Memorial Hall</ENAMEX>, contains the embalmed body of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who led the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">People‚Äôs Republic</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">its first 27 years</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mausoleum</ENAMEX>, which is bigger than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lenin‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tomb</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Moscow‚Äôs Red Square</ENAMEX>, is open to a procession of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX>, who are allowed <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">only a few minutes</TIMEX> inside. A grandiose building on the west side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Great Hall of the People</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renmin Dahuitang</ENAMEX>), erected in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1959</TIMEX>, is the meeting place of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National People‚Äôs Congress</ENAMEX>; the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Great Hall</ENAMEX> offers tours. At the heart of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Monument to the People‚Äôs Heroes</ENAMEX>, a granite obelisk where the democracy movement was headquartered in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX>. 
Far across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plaza</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard museums</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> cover the history of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum of Chinese History</ENAMEX> are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9,000</NUMEX> items from prehistoric fossils to breathtaking pottery and bronzes. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum of the Chinese Revolution</ENAMEX> houses <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Communist Party</ENAMEX> documents and displays. The explanations are in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> only, but you can buy an illustrated guide in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> from the bookstall to the left of the entrance. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North</ENAMEX> across <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Changan Avenue</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Tiananmen Square</ENAMEX> (and leading to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Forbidden City</ENAMEX>) is the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Gate</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Heavenly Peace</ENAMEX>, with its famous portrait of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mao</ENAMEX>. Atop this formidable stone <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wall</ENAMEX> is a rostrum for reviewing parades, and behind it a massive wooden gate-<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> with a double roof. The original <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">gate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> was rebuilt in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1651</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Tourists</ENAMEX> are now allowed to survey the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> from atop the gate, a vantage point once reserved for emperors and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rulers</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Forbidden City</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gu Gong</ENAMEX>)
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> is too sprawling a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> for strolling around, so you can forget the sort of browsing that some <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> offer. Among several exceptions, though, is the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Forbidden City</ENAMEX>. Here you will find <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">more than 72 hectares</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">175 acres</NUMEX>) of grandeur, with <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palaces</ENAMEX>, courtyards, and gardens. It is a walled rectangular island within a massive moat wide enough for naval engagements.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Forbidden City</ENAMEX>, so described because it was off-limits to ordinary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nearly 500 years</TIMEX>, is now called the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palace Museum</ENAMEX>. Designed to contain the auspicious number of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9,999</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX>, its scale is overwhelming and leaves many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> bewildered. Built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years 1406‚Äì1420</TIMEX>, it was the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> emperors for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nearly seven centuries</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Tourists</ENAMEX> normally enter the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Forbidden City</ENAMEX> from the south, after a long walk along a cobbled <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roadway</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Gate</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Heavenly Peace</ENAMEX>. The main entrance to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">compound</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meridian Gate</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wumen</ENAMEX>), was designed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 15th century</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Officials</ENAMEX> used the left portal, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the imperial family the right. Next comes another ceremonial gate, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Gate</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Harmony</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taihemen</ENAMEX>), first erected in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1420</TIMEX>. A pair of monumental bronze <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">lions</ENAMEX> stand <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guard</ENAMEX>.
Beyond this powerful defense <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">line</ENAMEX> stands <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China‚</ENAMEX>Äôs supreme ensemble of ancient architecture. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX> and foremost is the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hall of Great Harmony</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taihedian</ENAMEX>), popularly called the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">‚ÄúHall of the Imperial Throne</ENAMEX>.‚Äù This is the biggest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Forbidden City</ENAMEX> and one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most beautiful wooden <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX>. For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> during the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ming</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qing</ENAMEX> dynasties this was the tallest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> in all <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX>; by law no <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> could rise higher. (Counting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">hall‚Äôs upswept roof decorations</ENAMEX>, that meant the limit was <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">approximately 371‚ÅÑ2 m</TIMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">123</NUMEX> ft.) Inside, on a raised <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platform</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">‚ÄúSon of Heaven‚</ENAMEX>Äù sat on his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dragon Throne</ENAMEX> surrounded by symbols of longevity and power and cowering acolytes, all covered in a fog of incense. To the tune of gongs and chimes, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> knelt to kowtow <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> times.
Less formal occasions took place in the smaller, golden-roofed <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hall of Central Harmony</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zhonghedian</ENAMEX>), behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hall of Great Harmony</ENAMEX>. A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX> in this series, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hall of Preserving Harmony</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baohedian</ENAMEX>), was used, among other things, for the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> examinations, which were the world‚Äôs first civil-service tests. Behind this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX>, in the center of a stairway, is a ramp full of sculptured dragons carved from a single slab of marble weighing <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">more than 200 tons</NUMEX>. It was reserved for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">emperor‚Äôs sedan</ENAMEX> chair. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">laborers</ENAMEX> worked to pull the block to this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">site</ENAMEX> from the quarry <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">48 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">30 miles</NUMEX>) away; ingeniously, the operation was scheduled for deepest <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> so that the load could be slid along specially iced <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX>.
From here to the north, the density of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Forbidden City</ENAMEX> increases markedly as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> passes from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Outer Court</ENAMEX> (where official business was conducted) to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">halls</ENAMEX> and pavilions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inner Court</ENAMEX> (where the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emperor</ENAMEX>, the imperial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, and court <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> lived). Many of the old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palaces</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">halls</ENAMEX> are now used to display the artwork and more prosaic belongings of the emperors. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hall of Clocks and Hall of Jewelry</ENAMEX>, collections of gifts to the emperors, are worth a detour to the right, as is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nine-Dragon Screen</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jiulongbi</ENAMEX>), carved in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1775</TIMEX>.
The rear (northern) section of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Forbidden City</ENAMEX> contains the pavilions where the imperial family resided and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ends</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Imperial Gardens</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yuhuayuan</ENAMEX>), with magnificent stone <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rockeries</ENAMEX>, site of a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Daoist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> that dates back to the completion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Forbidden City</ENAMEX> itself under the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ming</ENAMEX> emperors in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1420</TIMEX>.

Just north of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Forbidden City</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>, along the main imperial axis, is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jingshan Park</ENAMEX>, better known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coal Hill</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meishan</ENAMEX>). The highest point of old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX>, the hill was created from earth that was removed to form the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">moat system</ENAMEX> around the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Forbidden City</ENAMEX>. Each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> artificial peaks was provided with a romantically designed <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pavilion</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-tiered <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Pavilion</ENAMEX> of Ten <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Thousand Springs</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wanchunting</ENAMEX>), on the middle peak, offers an inspiring view over the glistening rooftops of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Imperial City</ENAMEX>, with the modern capital beyond.
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Beihai Park</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beijing‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">favorite</ENAMEX>, has been a beauty spot for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">many hundreds</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>. Its lake, which young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couples</ENAMEX> now explore in rented rowing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX>, was created in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 12th century</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">graceful Bridge</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eternal Peace</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yonganqiao</ENAMEX>) leads to an artificial island <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a mile</NUMEX> in circumference with a long covered corridor that sweeps along the northern shore. On a hill in the center of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">isle</ENAMEX> is situated a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tibetan</ENAMEX>-style <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White Dagoba</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baita</ENAMEX>), at the back of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yongan Temple</ENAMEX>. In springtime the dagoba seems to burst from waves of green leaves. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> and fall, this is the most beautiful and lively <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> to stroll through in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple of Heaven Park</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Tiantan Park</ENAMEX>, known to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreigners</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Heaven Park</ENAMEX>, is the biggest of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beijing‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX>, celebrated for its assembly of thrilling <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15th-century</TIMEX> architecture. The highlight is the circular, blue tile-roofed <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Hall of Prayer for Good Harvest</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qiniandian</ENAMEX>). This marvel of geometry, art, and engineering, built without a single nail, measures <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">371‚ÅÑ2 m</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">123 ft</ENAMEX>) to the gilded orb on its topmost roof. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1889</TIMEX> the masterpiece was struck by lightning and burned almost to the ground. Fortunately, the ruin was quickly restored to its original, resplendent <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emperor</ENAMEX> was carried here in a procession in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first lunar month of each year</TIMEX> to pray for a bountiful harvest. The floor plan of the hall provides the key to the building‚Äôs function. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> central columns represent the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seasons</TIMEX>; then come <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concentric</ENAMEX> rings of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> columns each, representing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the months</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">the dozen</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two-hour</TIMEX> periods into which <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> was divided; and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX> hardwood pillars symbolize the constellations.
Although <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> can no longer enter this monument, its colorful interiors can still be glimpsed from outside. Other attractions at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> include the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Round Altar</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Haunqiutan</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Echo Wall</ENAMEX>, where whispered secrets ricochet and are mysteriously magnified, crossing an immense <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX>, without benefit of modern technology. 
Top Temples
Beijing‚Äôs most popular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> is a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lamasery</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Palace of Harmony</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peace</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yonghegong</ENAMEX>), popularly known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lama Temple</ENAMEX>. It was originally the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prince</ENAMEX> who became the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Emperor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yongzheng</ENAMEX>. The stately <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> of wooden <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>, containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly 1,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX>, has been painstakingly restored. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> recalls <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th-century</TIMEX> efforts to unify <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mongolia</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tibet</ENAMEX>.
Across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> and down a narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lama Temple</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beijing‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most serene place of worship, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple of Confucius</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kongzimiao</ENAMEX>), with statues and stone tablets honoring the ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sage</ENAMEX>.
Other temples of significant interest and variety are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Bell Temple</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dazhongsi</ENAMEX>), with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China‚</ENAMEX>Äôs leading collection of antique bells; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White Pagoda</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baitasi</ENAMEX>), with its newly renovated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13th century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tibetan</ENAMEX> stupa, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China‚</ENAMEX>Äôs largest; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Five Pagoda Temple</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wutasi</ENAMEX>), decorated with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX>-influenced sculptures; and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White Clouds Daoist Temple</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baiyuanguan</ENAMEX>), where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beijingers</ENAMEX> of all ages <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX> in to pray for good fortune at a variety of most unusual <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrines</ENAMEX>.
An <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Observatory, a Zoo</ENAMEX>, and an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aquarium</ENAMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ancient Beijing Observatory</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guguanxiangtai</ENAMEX>), built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1442</TIMEX>, stands atop a remnant of the old city <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wall</ENAMEX> on the busiest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> in central <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jianguomenwaidajie</ENAMEX>). Many of the bronze instruments, sundials, and sextants on display inside and on the roof of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">observatory</ENAMEX> were gifts from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jesuit</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">missionaries</ENAMEX> who lived in the capital during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th century</TIMEX>.
China‚Äôs largest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">zoo</ENAMEX>, in the northwestern sector of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX>, now includes a separate indoor-outdoor <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pavilion</ENAMEX> for its lovable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">giant</ENAMEX> pandas. The older <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> (dating back to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qing Dynasty</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> Manchurian <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">tigers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Tibetan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">yaks</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">snow leopards</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">P√®re David‚Äôs deer</ENAMEX>, known to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúquadruple unlikeness‚Äù</ENAMEX> (sibuxiang) because it has characteristics of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">deer</ENAMEX>, the reindeer, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ox</ENAMEX>, and the donkey. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">zoo</ENAMEX> is popular with local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, but most foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> find the facilities too antiquated and its conditions poor.
Rather than upgrade its aged <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beijing Zoo</ENAMEX> has just opened the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Beijing Aquarium</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China‚</ENAMEX>Äôs largest, on adjacent property. <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Home</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">whales</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dolphins</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>, the huge conch-shaped facility features a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚ÄúTouch Tidepool</ENAMEX>,‚Äù sea mammal shows, and some of the world‚Äôs largest acrylic viewing panels.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hutongs</ENAMEX> and Courtyards
Growing in popularity in the face of extinction by bulldozer, the hutongs (traditional alleyways) and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard houses</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> are worth a visit. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Every year these old</TIMEX> neighborhoods are reduced as the capital relentlessly reconstructs itself, but it‚Äôs still possible to book a guided pedicab tour of the hutongs. Wandering the backstreets in the old lake district north of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beihai Park</ENAMEX>, these pedicab caravans make stops at the ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Drum Tower</ENAMEX> for panoramic views, at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Prince Gong‚Äôs Palace</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gongwangfu</ENAMEX>) for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> and sometimes opera in a lavish grand <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ming Dynasty</ENAMEX> estate, and at a typical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard home</ENAMEX> in a hutong neighborhood for a chance to meet and talk with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX>.
If time allows for further exploration of these old neighborhoods, poke around <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Qianhai</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Houhai</ENAMEX> lakes for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekend</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> markets. Here you‚Äôll find <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Songqingling Guzhu</ENAMEX>, the former <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Soong Ching-ling</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> of modern <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China‚Äôs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sun Yat-sen</ENAMEX>), who lived in this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard mansion</ENAMEX> after the revolution. It is now a family <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shopping Districts</ENAMEX>
Some of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beijing‚</ENAMEX>Äôs few walkable areas are its chief shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> and markets. Wangfujing, running north a few blocks east of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Forbidden City</ENAMEX>, is the capital‚Äôs primary shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>, lined with upscale <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boutiques</ENAMEX> and glittering shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plazas</ENAMEX>, although a few venerable arts and crafts <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">galleries</ENAMEX>, and old department <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> still survive. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Tiananmen Square</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Liulichang Street</ENAMEX> has been restored to its <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Ming Dynasty</ENAMEX> appearance and is a shopper‚Äôs delight. Liulichang, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beijing‚</ENAMEX>Äôs premier antiques market, extends eastward into <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Dazhalan Street</ENAMEX>, a pedestrian <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mall</ENAMEX> famous for silk and jewelry <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>.
Outdoor markets, where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> must bargain at length, are another walking adventure. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Silk Alley</ENAMEX>, the most famous and most overpriced, specializes in designer fashions. More clothes and furs are found at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yabao Market</ENAMEX>, near <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Ritan Park</ENAMEX> (popularly known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Russian Market</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hongxiao Market</ENAMEX>, near the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX> of Heaven, features clothing, crafts, and freshwater pearls. The most colorful market is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Panjiayuan</ENAMEX> (know as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dirt Market</ENAMEX>), starting at sunrise <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every Sunday</TIMEX>, with its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stalls</ENAMEX> of collectibles, antiques, family treasures, tomb art, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tibetan</ENAMEX> rugs, furniture, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mao</ENAMEX> memorabilia.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Summer Palace</ENAMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> name for this convergence of natural and man-made beauty is <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Yiheyuan¬†‚Äî¬†the ‚ÄúPark of Nurtured Harmony</ENAMEX>.‚Äù <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Foreigners</ENAMEX> call this <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">280-hectare</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">700-acre</NUMEX>) imperial estate the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Summer Palace</ENAMEX>. In actual fact, the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">250-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palaces</ENAMEX>, pavilions, temples, and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">halls</ENAMEX> occupy only a small part of the dreamily landscaped area. By far the largest feature of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kunming Lake</ENAMEX>.
Contemporary <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">historians</ENAMEX> wax indignant that, under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qing Dynasty</ENAMEX>, funds appropriated for the imperial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">navy</ENAMEX> were, in fact, siphoned off to make <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yiheyuan</ENAMEX> an increasingly luxurious private <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>. Perhaps the most astonishing of the items on which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Empress Dowager Cixi</ENAMEX> squandered the naval budget is a double-decker <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Marble Boat</ENAMEX> beached at the edge of the lake. You can view this monument to royal folly, but you can no longer board it.
Among the outstanding <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> are the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hall of Joyful Longevity</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leshoutang</ENAMEX>) and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Seventeen-Arch Bridge</ENAMEX>, but the most magnificent structure is the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Long Corridor</ENAMEX>, a wooden gallery <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">728 m</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly half</NUMEX> a mile) in length. This covered way, which is interrupted by octagonal pavilions, is decorated with landscape paintings and depictions of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">legends</ENAMEX>. It‚Äôs like a long, unfolding wooden <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scroll</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Old Cathay</ENAMEX>, a lakeside <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">gallery</ENAMEX> recording all that was once the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Middle Kingdom</ENAMEX>. 
Not far from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Summer Palace</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Old Summer Palace</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yuanmingyuan</ENAMEX>), once the emperor‚Äôs <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> retreat. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1860</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX> razed most of the grand <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>, including a complex modeled after <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Versailles</ENAMEX>. The ghostly ruins make an idyllic picnic ground.
Excursions from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Great Wall</ENAMEX>
It‚Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 80 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 miles</NUMEX>) from the center of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> northwest to the most visited stretch of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Great Wall</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>, at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Badaling</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">The trip</ENAMEX> telescopes history, from the modern capital through the outskirts where donkey <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">carts</ENAMEX> and cargo<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">-</ENAMEX>carrying <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bicycles</ENAMEX> share the road, past <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">farms</ENAMEX> where nothing seems to have changed for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX>, to a harsh mountain range where <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly one million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> walled in an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX>. Like all the real wonders of the world, this one is more awesome when visited in person than it is in any film or book.
The first elements of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wall system</ENAMEX> were built <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 2,000</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX>, but the expansion and consolidation of the project near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> began under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ming Dynasty</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 14th century</TIMEX>. The serpentine stone bulwark and elevated <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">highway</ENAMEX> became <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wanlichangcheng¬†‚Äî¬†‚ÄúThe Wall Ten Thousand Li Long‚Äù</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 6,000 km/3,700 miles</NUMEX>).
The restored section of the wall at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Badaling</ENAMEX>, undulating up the unexpectedly steep hillsides, can be a test of a tourist‚Äôs endurance. It is far steeper and more formidable than it looks in any tourist brochure. Out of breath, many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> exchange sympathetic smiles along the way as they ascend to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or another of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">towers</ENAMEX>. If you walk far enough west, you come upon unrestored sections of the wall at the edge of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gobi Desert</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Badaling</ENAMEX> section is often overcrowded <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these days</TIMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> other sections now provide relatively easy access to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX>: the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Great Wall</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mutianyu</ENAMEX>, as beautiful as the section at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Badaling</ENAMEX> but a little less steep, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Great Wall</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Simatai</ENAMEX>, more distant from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> than other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX> but virtually unrestored. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Simatai</ENAMEX> is the least crowded and most original of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Great Wall sites</ENAMEX>. Although it too has a cable-<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concession</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Simatai</ENAMEX> bills itself as ‚Äúthe most dangerous section of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Great Wall</ENAMEX>.‚Äù
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ming Tombs</ENAMEX>
On the way to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Great Wall</ENAMEX> is the peaceful valley the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ming</ENAMEX> emperors chose as their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">burial ground</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1407</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Emperor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yongle</ENAMEX> ordered a search for a suitable burial place with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">auspicious ‚Äúwind</ENAMEX> and water‚Äù conditions, as well as appropriate grandeur. This site proved so perfect that all but <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of the succeeding <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ming</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rulers</ENAMEX> were entombed in the same valley.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sacred Way</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ming Tombs</ENAMEX> begins at a great marble gateway <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than four centuries old</TIMEX>. Beyond this is the main gate with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> archways; the middle arch was used only once in each <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">reign¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†for the delivery of the emperor‚Äôs remains to his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tomb</ENAMEX>. Then comes the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Avenue of the Animals</ENAMEX>, which is lined with massive statues of real and mythical <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">beasts</ENAMEX>.
The largest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tomb</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Changling</ENAMEX>) belonged to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yongle</ENAMEX> himself. Its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hall of Eminent Favors</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lingendian</ENAMEX>) is among the largest wooden <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX> gilded pillars supporting the coffered ceiling were fashioned from a huge tree that took <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than five years</TIMEX> to ship here from southwest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ninety</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> steps take you down below ground level to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dingling</ENAMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tomb</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Emperor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wanli</ENAMEX>, whose reigned from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1573 to 1620</TIMEX>). It took <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six years</TIMEX> to build this underground <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX>. Most of the regalia and artifacts on display, including the red wooden coffin containers in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">burial vault</ENAMEX>, are copies of the items discovered during excavations in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1950s</TIMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Qing</ENAMEX> Tombs
While many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ming Tombs</ENAMEX> find the site crowded and uninspiring, there is a fascinating alternative. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eastern Qing Tombs</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dongqingling</ENAMEX>) mimic the older <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ming</ENAMEX> architecture but are grander and more effectively restored. They are also more than twice as far from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX>: <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">125 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">78 miles</NUMEX>) to the east on slow but interesting <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX>. Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> tombs open to view, those of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> most powerful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manchu</ENAMEX> emperors, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qianlong</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kangxi</ENAMEX>, are impressive, and that of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Empress Dowager Cixi</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1835‚Äì1911</ENAMEX>) is as elaborate as it is strange.
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Changsha</ENAMEX>
If you go to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Changsha</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX>, you will arrive at the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> biggest railway <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>, a distinction quite out of proportion to the amount of rail traffic or the size of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. The explanation is that, until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 1970s</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">legions</ENAMEX> of pilgrims converged on this provincial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> in search of the roots of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mao Zedong</ENAMEX>. Now that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cult</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mao</ENAMEX> has faded in glory, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stations</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrines</ENAMEX> are uncrowded and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Changsha</ENAMEX> has returned to its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age-old</TIMEX> role as a rather prosaic regional <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">center</ENAMEX> of trade and culture. However, the surrounding fertile countryside is attractive, the spicy <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hunan</ENAMEX> cuisine is worth trying, the scenic mountain areas of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX> are outstanding, and the archaeological displays are stunning.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hunan Province</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Changsha</ENAMEX> lies along the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Xiang River</ENAMEX>, a wide and often turbulent stream that flows into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yangzi</ENAMEX>. The long thin strip of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Orange Island</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Juzizhou</ENAMEX>), rich in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oranges</ENAMEX> among other <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crops</ENAMEX>, bisects the river and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 20th century</TIMEX> was home to a small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> of Western <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">missionaries</ENAMEX>. From the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pavilion</ENAMEX> at the southern tip there is an engrossing view of sampans, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">barge trains</ENAMEX>, and passenger <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX>. On the far side of the river, fragrant forests climb the slopes of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yuelu Hill</ENAMEX>, a favorite escape from the subtropical heat of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the evergreen <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> in the mountainside <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lushan Temple</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 1,700</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years old</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qing Dynasty</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pavilion</ENAMEX> on top (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yunlugong</ENAMEX>) affords a fine panorama.
For most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> the prime attraction of the region is found in the northeast part of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>: the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hunan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Provincial Museum</ENAMEX>, with its renowned relics of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Han Dynasty</ENAMEX>, including silks, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ceramics</ENAMEX>, and lacquerware of unbelievable sophistication, as well as alluring figurines and musical instruments. All these artifacts survived because they were buried in coffins within coffins in subterranean royal tombs. These beautiful wooden boxes come from the royal graves at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mawangdui</ENAMEX>, as does the museum‚Äôs show-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stopper</ENAMEX>: the remarkably well-preserved silk-wrapped mummy of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marquis of Dai‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tohou</ENAMEX>, who died at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 50</TIMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">186 b.c. Nearly 2,200 years later</TIMEX>, her hair is still on her head and her expression is unchanged from the moment of her last breath.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Tourists</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Changsha</ENAMEX> are sometimes taken to visit the local embroidery <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factory</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hunan‚</ENAMEX>Äôs handicraft tradition has flourished for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2,000 years</TIMEX>. Staff <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> paint original designs, usually of landscapes, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>, which the artisans reproduce stitch by microscopic stitch in colorful silk. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> here are proudest of the double-faced embroidery, with a different picture on each side.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Changsha</ENAMEX> also features sites linked with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mao</ENAMEX> and the revolution. Foremost is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hunan‚Äôs</ENAMEX> first <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Teachers‚Äô Training School</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diyishifan</ENAMEX>). Reconstructed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1968</TIMEX>, it resembles a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monastery</ENAMEX>, with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arcades</ENAMEX> and gardens. During the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Cultural Revolution</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> thronged the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX>, for this is where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mao Zedong</ENAMEX> studied from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1913 to 1918</TIMEX> and later taught. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">classroom</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> desks where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mao</ENAMEX> sat and the crowded <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dormitory</ENAMEX> where he slept under a mosquito net are on view.
Since the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">100th</NUMEX> anniversary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mao‚</ENAMEX>Äôs birth (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1893</TIMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> have been to the village of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shaoshan, Mao‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">birthplace</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two hours</TIMEX> by bus from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Changsha</ENAMEX>. The principal sights are the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> where he was born, quite roomy by local standards, and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> with all the exhibits in duplicate, filling <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> mirror-image wings designed to double the crowd capacity.
Excursions in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hunan</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Outdoor enthusiasts</ENAMEX> and independent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">travelers</ENAMEX> might have time to explore <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hunan‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most spectacular natural attractions. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern Heng Mountain</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hengshannan</ENAMEX>, also called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nanyue</ENAMEX>), one of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China‚Äôs Five Sacred Mountains</ENAMEX> in the ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daoist pantheon</ENAMEX>, is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">112 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">70 miles</NUMEX>) south of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Changsha</ENAMEX>. Its temples, monasteries, and misty vistas are well worth a day‚Äôs hike. Wulingyuan, a large nature preserve better known to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhangjiajie</ENAMEX>, is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">350 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">217 miles</NUMEX>) west of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Changsha</ENAMEX>. Known as <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚ÄúChina‚Äôs Yellowstone</ENAMEX>,‚Äù this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UNESCO</ENAMEX> World Heritage Site is a remote <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> of spectacular and uncanny quartz labyrinths and pinnacles, massive limestone caves, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">white-water rapids</ENAMEX>, steep hiking <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">trails</ENAMEX>, and minority <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX>. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chengde</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jehol</ENAMEX>)
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> the trip to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chengde</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 250 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">150 miles</NUMEX>) northeast of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX>, might well be one of the prettiest anywhere in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>. Fertile fields alternate with stony hills, miraculously <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">sprouting trees</ENAMEX>, and wildflowers. In the hamlets along the way, trim <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> are roofed with thatch or traditional tile with winged projections. In the fields, the labor is done mostly by hand, and when <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> are not available, even the heavy plowing is done by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> in harness. Chengde itself looks, at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> glance, like any other northern <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> industrial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, but the dreariness is interspersed with beautifully sited old temples and an imperial pleasure-ground big enough to be protected by a wall <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6 miles</NUMEX>) long.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palaces</ENAMEX> and gardens of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chengde</ENAMEX> provided summertime escape for the imperial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qing Dynasty</ENAMEX>, beginning with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Emperor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kangxi</ENAMEX>, who created the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">halls</ENAMEX>, lakes, and hunting grounds here as a second summer <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1703</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kangxi</ENAMEX> called these royal parklands <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bishushanzhuang, or ‚ÄúMountain Villa for Escaping the Summer Heat</ENAMEX>.‚Äù Indeed, its altitude¬†‚Äî¬†at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 350 m</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 1,100</NUMEX> ft) above sea level¬†‚Äî¬†provides relief from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX> heat, as do the surrounding mountains, forests, and rivers.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Visitors</ENAMEX> enter this royal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> at the ceremonial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lizheng Gate</ENAMEX>, flanked by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">marble lions</ENAMEX>. The old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> and royal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">halls</ENAMEX> now serve as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX>. Among the exhibits are bows and arrows and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">flintlocks</ENAMEX>, rare jade and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">porcelain</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">sedan</ENAMEX> chairs in which the emperors were transported all the way from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">emperor‚Äôs bedroom</ENAMEX> is located in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Refreshing Mist-Veiled Waters Pavilion</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">halls</ENAMEX> and courtyards are eminently regal, yet they also inspire a feeling of relaxation appropriate to the setting. The plain wooden <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">corridors</ENAMEX> connecting the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> contrast with the illustrated passageways of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Beijing‚Äôs Summer Palace</ENAMEX>, which occupies but half the space of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chengde</ENAMEX> retreat. 
The landscape beyond the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace compound</ENAMEX> features many of the romantic elements of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> tradition: interconnected lakes and lotus ponds, forests, causeways and arched <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridges</ENAMEX>, ornate pavilions, and towering pagodas. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Tower of Mist</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rain</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yanyulou</ENAMEX>), a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-story <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lakeside pavilion</ENAMEX> in the southern style, was favored by emperors for its foggy views resembling those of an old <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> painting. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Tourists</ENAMEX> can cross the lakes in hand-poled ferryboats or drift at their own pace in a rowing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North</ENAMEX> of the lakes there are hiking <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">trails</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Garden of Ten Thousand Trees</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wanahuyuan</ENAMEX>), where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Emperor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Qianlong</ENAMEX> gave an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1793</TIMEX> to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ambassador</ENAMEX> to set foot in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lord</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Macartney</ENAMEX>. The meeting did not go well.
Beyond the wall surrounding the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> and its gardens rise the exotic roofs of the Eight <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Outer Temples</ENAMEX>, built by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emperors</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1713 and 1779</TIMEX> to honor and influence <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Tibetans</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Kazakhs</ENAMEX>, and other northern <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peoples</ENAMEX>. All are open to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> grandest temples are <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Tibetan</ENAMEX> in style. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mount Sumera Longevity</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Happiness Temple</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xumifushoumiao</ENAMEX>) is a copy of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">sixth</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Panchen Lama‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shigatse</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tibet</ENAMEX>. The high red walls surround a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pavilion</ENAMEX> with a roof gilded in a ton of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">A mile</NUMEX> east, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Small Potala Temple</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Putuozongshengmiao</ENAMEX>), the largest at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chengde</ENAMEX>, evokes the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Dalai Lama‚Äôs Potala Palace</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lhasa</ENAMEX> and is so steep a climb (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">164</NUMEX> steps) that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">sedan</ENAMEX>-chair <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carriers</ENAMEX> do a brisk trade with weary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX>. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chengdu</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chengtu</ENAMEX>)
Balmy and often misty weather keeps <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chengdu</ENAMEX> green and full of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers year ‚Äòround</ENAMEX>. It‚Äôs the climate in which bamboo thrives, and bamboo is the staple of the giant <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">panda</ENAMEX>. The best place to spot these cuddly-looking <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">beasts</ENAMEX> in something resembling the wilds is at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China Research</ENAMEX> Base of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giant Panda Breeding</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">11 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">7 miles</NUMEX>) northeast of downtown <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chengdu</ENAMEX>, where <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a dozen</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pandas</ENAMEX> have free run of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">some 30 hectares</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">80 acres</NUMEX>) of bamboo groves. There‚Äôs a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panda museum</ENAMEX> here, too. In closer confines, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chengdu Zoo</ENAMEX> has more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">resident</ENAMEX> pandas (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about a dozen</NUMEX>) than does any other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">zoo</ENAMEX> in the world. The thin bamboo stalks they find so delicious are grown right in the grounds. Because they are the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stars</ENAMEX> of this attraction, the giant pandas are assigned high-ceilinged, spacious <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cages</ENAMEX> and outdoor play areas.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chengdu</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sichuan</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Szechuan</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Province</ENAMEX>, the natural habitat for eighty percent of the world‚Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,000</NUMEX> giant pandas. But <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chengdu</ENAMEX> has other attractions as well, some of them historical, some of them spiritual, and some of them edible.
At the time of the era of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Three Kingdoms</ENAMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the third century</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chengdu</ENAMEX> was capital of the feudal <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kingdom of Shu</ENAMEX>, and politics, not pandas, was the prime attraction. The principal monument from that era is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marquis Wu</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wuhouci</ENAMEX>), a complex of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">halls</ENAMEX> and gardens in the southern suburbs built to commemorate the kingdom‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prime minister</ENAMEX>. Known in his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">lifetime</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">a.d. 181‚Äì234</ENAMEX>) as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhugeliang</ENAMEX>, he was posthumously ennobled for his role in unifying the region and developing its economy and culture. In the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX>, built in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tang Dynasty</ENAMEX>, there are gilt statues of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zhugeliang</ENAMEX>, his son, and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandson</ENAMEX>; the latter died in battle at the age of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> literary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilgrims</ENAMEX> are drawn to another of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chengdu‚</ENAMEX>Äôs historic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX>, the thatched cottage of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dufu</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dufucaotang</ENAMEX>), a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrine</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> at the spot where the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poet</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tang Dynasty</ENAMEX> lived in exile from the capital for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several years</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dufu</ENAMEX> (formerly spelled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tufu</ENAMEX>) lived from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">712 to 770</TIMEX> and wrote <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 1,400</NUMEX> poems, many of them regarded as the greatest in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">canon</ENAMEX>.
Chengdu‚Äôs most popular <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Daoist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qingyanggong (‚ÄúGreen Goat Temple‚Äù</ENAMEX>), is a lively, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garish complex</ENAMEX> where <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bronze ‚Äúgood luck‚Äù goats</ENAMEX> at the main altar have been rubbed smooth by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worshippers</ENAMEX> seeking their fortunes. Not far away is the center of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zen</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chan</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buddhism</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sichuan</ENAMEX>, the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1,300-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wenshu Temple</ENAMEX>, which maintains its own <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> of woodcarvers as well as a vegetarian restaurant and outdoor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">teahouse</ENAMEX>. 
Chengdu‚Äôs largest and most renowned religious monument, located <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">28 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">17 miles</NUMEX>) north of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Divine Light Monastery</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baoguangsi</ENAMEX>). The most photographed element of this vast <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">establishment</ENAMEX> is the stupa, a slightly crooked <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>-level pagoda. It was built of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stone</ENAMEX> at the end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tang Dynasty</ENAMEX>, replacing an ancient wooden pagoda on the same spot. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">halls</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monastery</ENAMEX> are filled with works of art, including <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX> sculptures, religious and landscape paintings, and examples of many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> of calligraphy. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX> contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> larger-than-life-sized statues of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">saints</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">‚ÄúAncestor Garden</ENAMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">‚Äù</ENAMEX> formerly reserved for retired <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">monks</ENAMEX>, has been appropriated for the use of foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> only¬†‚Äî¬†as a tearoom.
By long tradition, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chengdu</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China‚</ENAMEX>Äôs preeminent <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of teahouses. Many still operate along the north <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Jin (‚ÄúBrocade‚Äù) River</ENAMEX>, serving covered cups of flower <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Customers</ENAMEX> linger at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX> tables, watching trinket <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendors</ENAMEX> and pipe and tobacco <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">salesmen</ENAMEX> ply their trade along the river promenade.
Another restful spot is the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">River Viewing Pavilion</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wangjianglou</ENAMEX>), in a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> along the south <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Jin River</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">More than 100</NUMEX> kinds of bamboo grow here. As in other traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chengdu</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX>, there are pavilions and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">towers</ENAMEX>, rock gardens, ponds, and shady <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">paths</ENAMEX>. River viewing of a different type is recommended at the site of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Dujiangyan Irrigation System</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">57 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">35 miles</NUMEX>) northwest of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chengdu</ENAMEX>. This ambitious irrigation and flood-control project, built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the third century</TIMEX> b.c., is still in use. The lush hills along the shore provide a poetic setting for an engineering wonder.
In the center of town some neighborhoods retain a medieval look. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX>-story <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shophouses</ENAMEX>, some sagging with age, line the narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>. They have <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> on the ground floor and living <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">quarters</ENAMEX> above, with wooden <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">balconies</ENAMEX> and distinctive carved designs. But ‚Äúprogress‚Äù is inevitable. On the site of the ancient viceroy‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX>, in the very center of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chengdu</ENAMEX>, stands a heavy, columned socialist-realist <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>; a giant statue of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mao Zedong</ENAMEX> graces the entrance. The edifice is now a department store. In the main hall <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shoppers</ENAMEX> are inspired by portraits of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mao</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marx</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Engels</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lenin</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stalin</ENAMEX>. A special <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> catering to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> features such local specialties as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shu</ENAMEX> embroidery, toy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pandas</ENAMEX> (made of rabbit fur), pottery, and bamboo ware.
By way of local color, you shouldn‚Äôt turn down a chance to see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sichuan Opera</ENAMEX>. To make things more challenging, it‚Äôs all sung in the local dialect, but you can just relax and watch the spectacle of mime, dance, and acrobatics. <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">Backstage tours</ENAMEX> are arranged <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these days</TIMEX> by private tour <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operators</ENAMEX>. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sichuan</ENAMEX> cuisine, one of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> great <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> cooking, produces such imaginative creations as ‚Äúabalone and chrysanthemums,<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äù ‚Äúpeonies</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">butterflies</ENAMEX>,‚Äù and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äústewed bear‚Äôs trotters</ENAMEX> in brown <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sauce</ENAMEX>.‚Äù One of the most famous dishes, mapo dofu, consists of beancurd infused with chili peppers in a manner that numbs the tongue upon impact. 
For the more adventurous, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chengdu</ENAMEX> is the gateway to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Great Buddha</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leshan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mt. Emei</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">136</NUMEX>).
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chongqing</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chungking</ENAMEX>)
Although the city‚Äôs history goes back <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chongqing</ENAMEX> was never a cultural <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>, and it isn‚Äôt <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>. It cannot offer spectacular temples, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palaces</ENAMEX>, or archaeological sites. Rather, it is a place to see the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> life of a major <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> industrial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> and to begin some outstanding excursions on the legendary <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Yangzi River</ENAMEX>.
In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qin Dynasty</ENAMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the third century</TIMEX> b.c., the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> was the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> of the dreamily named <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kingdom of Ba</ENAMEX>. Its present name (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chongqing means ‚ÄúDouble Jubilation‚Äù</ENAMEX>) dates from the medieval period, commemorating a lucky streak in the life of the local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prince</ENAMEX>. Until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last few years</TIMEX> it was spelled <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chungking</ENAMEX>, by which name the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> was best known in the West as the political and military capital of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Nationalist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1939 to 1945</TIMEX>, the wartime redoubt of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chiang Kai-shek</ENAMEX>.
Although <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chongqing</ENAMEX> is physically located in subtropical <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sichuan</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Szechuan</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Province</ENAMEX>, since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 1997</TIMEX> it has been an autonomous governmental <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> (as are <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shanghai</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tianjin</ENAMEX>), with a staggering metropolitan <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 30 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. Set on a promontory where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yangzi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jialing</ENAMEX> rivers converge, this starkly industrial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of smokestacks is crucial to transportation and commerce in southwest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>. It presides over the portion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yangzi</ENAMEX> upstream from the massive <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Three Gorges Dam</ENAMEX> project, which sometime <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between the years 2009 and 2013</TIMEX> will create an immense reservoir and drown the most scenic section of the river. 
The sightseeing you remember best might be the lively free market lining the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of steps that descend higgledy-piggledy from the hills of central <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chongqing</ENAMEX> to the river. Hustling, bustling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peasants hawk</ENAMEX> the rich harvest of the surrounding farming <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>: cabbages and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oranges</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX> and live <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">chickens</ENAMEX> (they are weighed while flapping), river <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> and squirming <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">eels</ENAMEX>, and table after table of the most fragrant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spices</ENAMEX>, while <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stalls</ENAMEX> and hole-in-the-wall caf√©s heat up the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">city‚Äôs number-one dish</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sichuan</ENAMEX> hotpot.
Leading down to the river‚Äôs edge, the steep stone <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stairway</ENAMEX> known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Gate</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sky</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chaotianmen</ENAMEX>), which appears not to have been cleaned since the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Ming Dynasty</ENAMEX>, is treacherously overlaid with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mud</ENAMEX> and muck, so wear your safest shoes and walk with care. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Happily</ENAMEX>, at the bottom of this long descent there is a terminal for the funicular that returns you to the top of this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, which is so <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">hilly</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bicycles</ENAMEX> are almost unknown.
Sights worth seeing in town include the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chongqing People‚Äôs Hall</ENAMEX>, built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1953</TIMEX> to serve as a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,000</NUMEX>-seat conference <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX> and hotel. It blends the styles of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ming</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qing</ENAMEX> dynasties with the needs of a modern conference <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chongqing Museum</ENAMEX>, while poorly-lit and aging, does contain a collection of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dinosaur eggs</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two 3,000-year-old</TIMEX> wooden <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> that, suspended from the cliffs of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yangzi</ENAMEX>, served as caskets for nobles in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the days</TIMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ba Kingdom</ENAMEX>. Perhaps the liveliest sight in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chongqing</ENAMEX> is the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1,000-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Luohan Temple</ENAMEX>, where blind fortune-tellers and devoted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">followers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buddha</ENAMEX> converge from <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">dawn to dusk</TIMEX>. 
In the domain of darker political history, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> former <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Nationalist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prisons</ENAMEX> outside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> are open as monuments to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Revolutionary</ENAMEX> cause. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chiang Kai-shek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Criminal Acts Exhibition Hall</ENAMEX> (so goes the catchy title) includes cells and torture <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chambers</ENAMEX>. Western <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> are not usually shown around unless they specifically <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">request it.</ENAMEX> This is largely in deference to the sensitivities of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Europeans</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>, who are blamed for collusion with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Nationalists</ENAMEX> in the excesses of their anticommunist struggle.
Because of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Chongqing‚Äôs notoriously torrid summer weather¬†‚Äî¬†it‚Äôs</ENAMEX> known as one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚Äúovens‚Äù of China¬†‚Äî¬†hills</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX> are a very welcome refuge here. <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Loquat Hill</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pipashan</ENAMEX>), the city‚Äôs highest spot, has gardens, a teahouse (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hongxing</ENAMEX>), and some splendid <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">panoramas</ENAMEX>. The Northern and Southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hot Springs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beiwenquan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nanwenquan</ENAMEX>) are also popular gathering places, with well-kept public gardens. A typical <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chongqing</ENAMEX> method of escaping the heat is to take refuge in a cool cave. During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> air raids, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">air-raid shelters</ENAMEX> were dug into the mountains here, and some have been turned into caf√©s and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>.
Even in the heat of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX>, however, the most popular dish remains the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sichuan</ENAMEX> hotpot, a bowl of seething <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oils</ENAMEX> into which the diner dips and boils to perfection a selection of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meats</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetables</ENAMEX>, and beancurd, much like fighting fire with fire.
Excursions from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chongqing</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yangzi River Cruise</ENAMEX>
China‚Äôs most exciting <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> trip is the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Yangzi River</ENAMEX> cruise through the spectacular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Three Gorges</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sanxia</ENAMEX>). It takes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least three days</TIMEX> to go downriver from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chongqing</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wuhan</ENAMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">as many as five days</TIMEX> in the reverse direction, bucking the considerable tide. Until relatively recently the trip was considered an extended, risky adventure. The most awesome scenery is concentrated between the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sichuan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baidi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nanjin Pass</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hubei Province</ENAMEX>. The sight of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Yangzi</ENAMEX> water rushing between the sheer walls and evocative rock formations never fails to stir the traveler‚Äôs spirit. 
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National People‚Äôs Congress</ENAMEX> passed a resolution to launch the massive <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Three Gorges Hydropower</ENAMEX> Project, including the construction of a huge <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dam</ENAMEX> and a reservoir, slated for completion sometime after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year 2009</TIMEX>, which will submerge the most scenic sections of the river. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Tourists</ENAMEX> can choose between ordinary <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> passenger <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX> or more deluxe luxury cruise <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX> that cater to overseas <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">river boats</ENAMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> use lack frills, amenities, and guides. The luxury <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">craft</ENAMEX> charge much more but offer a good range of tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">services</ENAMEX>, including decent meals. Often reserved in part for package tours, these <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX> are also open to independent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">travelers</ENAMEX>, and staterooms can even be booked in advance overseas with such lines as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Victoria Cruises</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dazu Stone Sculptures</ENAMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China‚</ENAMEX>Äôs great artistic wonders, rated on par with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mogao Caves</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Silk Road</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dunhuang</ENAMEX>, is the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX> sculptural treasure of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dazu</ENAMEX>. This <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">district</ENAMEX> northwest of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chongqing</ENAMEX> was so inaccessible in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> times that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">many thousands</NUMEX> of statues were never exposed to pillage. Today, it still takes <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three hours</TIMEX> to cover the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">112 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">70 miles</NUMEX>) from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chongqing</ENAMEX>, even via the new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Chengyu Expressway</ENAMEX>.
The stone carvings of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dazu</ENAMEX> were begun late in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">ninth</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">century</TIMEX> during the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tang Dynasty</ENAMEX>; the work lasted well into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern Song</ENAMEX> period, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years later</TIMEX>. Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buddhism</ENAMEX> is their central theme, there are also sculptures representing historical and human-interest subjects.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern Hill</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beishan</ENAMEX>), situated <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only a couple of kilometers</NUMEX> north of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dazu</ENAMEX>, begins with a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> and a big, animated <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>. The wide, rocky valley below is filled with sculpture; every inch of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stone</ENAMEX> seems to have been carved. Among the perfectly preserved figures in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚ÄúThe Wheel of the Universe‚Äù in Grotto 136</ENAMEX> are the statues of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> holy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bodhisattvas Manjusri</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samatabhadra</ENAMEX>, who triumphed over evil. Helping to make <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern Hill</ENAMEX> an overwhelming experience is the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilgrims</ENAMEX> who still call upon these ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrines</ENAMEX>. 
Even more magnificent is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Treasure Peak</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baodingshan</ENAMEX>). Its sculptures are located in a natural arc of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stone</ENAMEX> known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Great Buddha Crescent</ENAMEX>, carved over a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">70-year</TIMEX> span by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX> monks during the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern Song Dynasty</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1127‚Äì1279</ENAMEX>). The biggest single work, an immense reclining <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buddha 29 m</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX> ft) long, is surrounded by the infinitely smaller statues of lifelike <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">disciples</ENAMEX>. Whereas grotto sculpture in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> is usually laid out more or less spontaneously, the caves here were apparently all planned to the last detail before the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stone</ENAMEX> was chipped, thus eliminating any repetition. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dazu</ENAMEX> represents the last great period of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX> cave sculpture in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>, and a long day‚Äôs journey out and back from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chongqing</ENAMEX> to this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stone crescent</ENAMEX> is unforgettable. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Dali</ENAMEX>
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yunnan Province</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 250 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">155 miles</NUMEX>) northwest of its capital <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kunming</ENAMEX> along the historic <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Burma Road route</ENAMEX>, is the scenic village of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dali</ENAMEX>, a favorite of independent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">backpackers</ENAMEX>. The surroundings could hardly be more spectacular, with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Erhai (‚ÄúEar Sea‚Äù</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lake</ENAMEX> to the east and the steep <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cangshan</ENAMEX> mountain range to the west. Best of all are the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dali</ENAMEX>, mostly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Bai</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minority</ENAMEX>, outgoing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who treat Western <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">travelers</ENAMEX> with wonderful hospitality.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, capital of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bai Autonomous Region</ENAMEX>, has sections of a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">medieval wall</ENAMEX> with formal gates on the north and south ends. Within the walls are a few intersecting main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> whose tile-roofed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> now serve as souvenir <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, private travel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>, hostels, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">and¬†‚Äî¬†above all¬†‚Äî¬†small</ENAMEX>, intimate, friendly caf√©s serving a truly international mix of inexpensive dishes.
The caf√© life in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dali</ENAMEX> is one of its chief delights. Caf√©s are perfect spots to wile away the sunny <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> over <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beer</ENAMEX> or to meet local <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Bai</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> as well as other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">travelers</ENAMEX>. Perhaps the most famous of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozens</NUMEX> of caf√©s is Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China Son‚Äôs Cultural Exchange Caf√©</ENAMEX>, run by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Uncle Li</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heliyi</ENAMEX>), the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bai</ENAMEX> in history to go abroad. His autobiography, on sale at his caf√©, is an epic soap opera.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dali</ENAMEX> also has sights and attractions well worth attending to when the caf√© and bistro scene begins to pale. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Erhai Lake</ENAMEX> is a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30-minute</TIMEX> walk from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, and its main <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Caicun</ENAMEX>, is a maze of unpaved <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">alleys</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mud</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>. Ferries cross the lake to even more remote <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX>, including the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> dedicated to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guanyin</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">goddess</ENAMEX> of mercy) on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Putuo Island</ENAMEX>. Any of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozens</NUMEX> of local travel <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> can quickly arrange an excursion to lakeside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX>, including the market at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wase</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> popular diversion is the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> outdoor market at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shaping</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 minutes</TIMEX> up the eucalyptus-lined road by minibus from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dali</ENAMEX>. It‚Äôs a vast market of country wares, batik, and horse-trading, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locals</ENAMEX> dressed in their traditional bright Bai jackets, tunics, and plumed caps.
The chief monument at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dali</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Three Pagodas</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santasi</ENAMEX>), founded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">825</TIMEX>. The tallest of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">towers</ENAMEX>, all sealed up, rises to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> tiers. The complex is ringed by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stalls</ENAMEX>, many of them selling specimens of the local marble. There are also temples and pagodas in the steep foothills of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cangshan</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Green Mountain</ENAMEX>) range. Although seldom open, they provide the perfect ornaments for a day‚Äôs hike from vista to vista over this long, narrow valley that reaches west to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tibet</ENAMEX>.
While young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adventurous travelers</ENAMEX> still flock to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dali</ENAMEX>, the opening of several new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> and a modern <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an hour</TIMEX> away has brought this exquisite little <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> Shangri-La within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">any visitor‚</TIMEX>Äôs reach.
As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dali</ENAMEX> is discovered by more and more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">travelers</ENAMEX> are heading out into even more remote regions of northwestern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yunnan</ENAMEX>. Particularly recommended is the village of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lijiang</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">150 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">95 miles</NUMEX>) north of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dali</ENAMEX>, under the shadow of the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5,500-m</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18,000</NUMEX>-ft) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jade Dragon Snow Mountain</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yulong Xue Shan</ENAMEX>). The old-town section, recently restored after a serious earthquake, is even more quaint than downtown <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dali</ENAMEX>, the local <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Naxi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are warm and open, and the nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">monasteries</ENAMEX> are intriguing.
From <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lijiang</ENAMEX>, one can journey still farther into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China‚</ENAMEX>Äôs ultimate outback, to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leaping Tiger Gorge</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xutiaoxia</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lugu Lake</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sichuan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Tibetan</ENAMEX> borders.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Datong</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tatung</ENAMEX>)
It takes <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about seven hours</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> to reach <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Datong</ENAMEX>, to the west in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shanxi</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shansi</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Province</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">The trip</ENAMEX>, through some gorgeous mountain <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, is a favorite of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enthusiasts</ENAMEX> who are drawn to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Datong</ENAMEX> to see the quaint steam locomotives still at work in the center of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China‚</ENAMEX>Äôs richest coal-mining region. Coal was the logical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fuel</ENAMEX> for the long <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trains</ENAMEX> carrying <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coal</ENAMEX> to the rest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Datong</ENAMEX> became the major steam <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">locomotive</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Datong Locomotive Works</ENAMEX> could turn out a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">locomotive</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every working day</TIMEX>. This <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factory</ENAMEX> now makes diesel engines only, but it is open for tours, highlighted by a ride on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the old steam locomotives.
Datong itself is a rather poor coal-mining and industrial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, somewhat behind the times, set on a loess plateau <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,000 m</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3,280 ft</NUMEX>) above sea level. The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summers</TIMEX> are short here on the edge of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Inner Mongolia</ENAMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winters</TIMEX> are glacial. It‚Äôs not the sort of place poets would eulogize, yet for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nearly a century</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">398‚Äì494</ENAMEX>) it served as the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern Wei Dynasty</ENAMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> monasteries and a famous <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dragon screen recall Datong‚Äôs</ENAMEX> once stately history. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nine Dragon Wall</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jiulongbi</ENAMEX>), a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ming</ENAMEX> landmark (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1392</TIMEX>), stands in the old part of town among the narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> lined by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">single</NUMEX>-story <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>. This is said to be the largest and oldest screen of its type anywhere in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>, at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">457 m</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">150 ft</ENAMEX>) certainly longer than the more famous version in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Forbidden City</ENAMEX>. The ceramic mural shows <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dragons</ENAMEX>, each in a different dynamic pose. When the sun reflects on the pool that runs along the base of the wall, the glazed tile <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">figures</ENAMEX> flash to life.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Huayan Monastery</ENAMEX>, built under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Liao Dynasty</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 11th century</TIMEX>, was finished by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jin Dynasty</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rulers</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1140</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monastery</ENAMEX> faces east and not, as was customary in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>, south. The main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Great Treasure Hall</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daxiongbaodian</ENAMEX>), is one of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> biggest <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">halls</ENAMEX> still standing in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>. The fine ceiling comprises <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">749</NUMEX> illustrated squares, no <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> the same. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> are enthroned the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Five Buddhas of the Five Directions</ENAMEX>, relics of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Ming Dynasty</ENAMEX>.
The other big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> in town, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shanhua Monastery</ENAMEX>, faces the old city <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wall</ENAMEX>, which is undergoing renovation. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monastery</ENAMEX> dates from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tang Dynasty</ENAMEX>, but it was largely rebuilt after a fire. Standing in the grand, red-walled <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pavilion</ENAMEX> are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> celestial guardians, each of distinct mien. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">circular ‚Äúmoon gate‚Äù</ENAMEX> in the side wall of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monastery</ENAMEX> leads to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Five Dragon Wall</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wulongbi</ENAMEX>), transplanted here from a former <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Confucian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX>. This ceramic screen resembles the lavish <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nine Dragon Wall</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town center</ENAMEX>, but here the middle dragon, terrifyingly, faces forward.
A major attraction near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Datong</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Temple Suspended Over the Void</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xuankongsi</ENAMEX>), situated a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two-hour</TIMEX> drive south through a barren sandstone plateau. Tours usually stop along the way at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">area‚Äôs cave houses</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> are happy to show off their hand-dug quarters. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">sixth</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">-century temple</ENAMEX> is spectacular, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 40</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">halls</ENAMEX> and pavilions which are joined by ornate catwalks, suspended as if by magic on the face of a sheer limestone cliff.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yungang Caves</ENAMEX>
Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists head</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Datong</ENAMEX> in pursuit of history and art, and they are not disappointed. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> is best known for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yungang Caves</ENAMEX>, which are <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">16 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 miles</NUMEX>) west of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Datong</ENAMEX> and contain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most treasured displays of ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX> sculpture. When the pious project was undertaken <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1,500 years ago</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 100,000</NUMEX> statues were carved into the walls of the rock <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temples</ENAMEX> dug into the cliff. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">About 50,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">statues remain¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†from the size of a postage stamp to the height of a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>-story <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†despite the rigors of time, the weather, and marauders.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Visitors</ENAMEX> enter the caves through a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monastery</ENAMEX> where <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,000</NUMEX> monks once lived. A wooden structure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> stories high, built in the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Ming Dynasty</ENAMEX>, blocks the winds that blast the caves. Carvings of the fanciful <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Third Son</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dragon</ENAMEX> protect the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> from fire. Tours normally begin at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Cave No. 5</ENAMEX>, which contains a seated <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buddha</ENAMEX> figure that is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">17 m</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">56</NUMEX> ft) high. The gold plating, an afterthought, was added in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qing Dynasty</ENAMEX>. As in most of the caves, the walls are filled with niches and small statues. In <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Cave No. 6</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">nearly square</NUMEX> in plan, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pagoda</ENAMEX> reaches to the ceiling. The life of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buddha</ENAMEX> from birth to the attainment of nirvana is illustrated in an intricately carved frieze running around the pagoda walls and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">sides</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">cave</ENAMEX>. The decoration in this cave is considered the supreme achievement of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yungang</ENAMEX>. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cave No. 7</ENAMEX> is notable for its beautifully carved ceiling. At the entrance to <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Cave No. 8</ENAMEX>, graceful <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX>-style statues face each other. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cave No. 9</ENAMEX> contains the smallest of all <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buddha</ENAMEX> figures here, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only 2 cm</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">less than 1 inch</NUMEX>) high. In <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Cave No. 10</ENAMEX>, note the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> influence in the headdress of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">guardian</ENAMEX> figure carved at the entrance. <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Cave No. 11</ENAMEX> is said to contain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 12,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buddha</ENAMEX> figures, more than any other cave; high up on the wall is a tablet reporting that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">83</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> worked for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six years</TIMEX> to complete the carvings in this one grotto. In <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Cave No. 12</ENAMEX>, heavenly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">musicians</ENAMEX> carved over the entrance are playing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> different ancient instruments. <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Notice</ENAMEX> an unusual feature of the giant statue in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Cave No. 13: the Buddha‚</ENAMEX>Äôs right wrist is supported by the small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">figure</ENAMEX> of a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-armed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sportsman</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Cave No. 14</ENAMEX> has suffered severe damage. (In general the wind has eroded the outward-facing walls in most of the caves; the best preserved <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">carvings</ENAMEX> tend to be on the opposite walls.) The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Cave of Ten Thousand Buddhas</ENAMEX> is the name of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Cave No. 15</ENAMEX>; the figures in this cave are arranged in a pigeonhole grid pattern.
The oldest caves of the whole <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">complex¬†‚Äî¬†dating</ENAMEX> from the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX> century¬†‚Äî¬†are numbered <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 to 20</NUMEX>. (The currently used east-to-west numbering scheme was inaugurated in modern times and bears little resemblance to the system used in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier centuries</TIMEX>.) In <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Cave No. 16</ENAMEX> are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> holes pierced through the outer wall, showing the original positions of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buddhas</ENAMEX> appropriated by foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">collectors</ENAMEX>; tour guides here say they are now in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York‚Äôs Metropolitan Museum</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Cave No. 17</ENAMEX>, like its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> on either side, has an oval floor-plan. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buddha‚</ENAMEX>Äôs upper arms sport <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>-style armbands.
The giant standing <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Buddha in Cave No. 18</ENAMEX> wears a strange vestment called the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚ÄúThousand Buddha Robe‚Äù</ENAMEX>; on the front of the garment the sculptor has carved a throng of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mini-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buddha</ENAMEX> figures. <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Cave No. 20</ENAMEX>, the last <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> carved while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Datong</ENAMEX> was the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern Wei Dynasty</ENAMEX>, is occupied by a giant seated <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buddha</ENAMEX>. It‚Äôs all the more dramatic since the front <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wall</ENAMEX> crumbled away, leaving the statue open to the sky.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dunhuang</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tunhuang</ENAMEX>)
It used to take <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24 hours</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX>, plus a cruel <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>- or <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three-hour</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bus</ENAMEX> or jeep journey, to reach the sleepy desert <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dunhuang</ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gansu</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX>. Now it‚Äôs an easy airplane ride from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xi‚Äôan.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dunhuang</ENAMEX> has come a long way since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the days</TIMEX> when the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Silk Road camel trains</ENAMEX> stopped here. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Camels</ENAMEX> still work in and around <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dunhuang</ENAMEX>, pulling plows or transporting cargo. If you‚Äôve just come from overpopulated eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>, you might feel all but alone in a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 10,000</NUMEX>. Although some donkey <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">carts</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bicycles</ENAMEX> occasionally impinge on the tranquillity of the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>, the townsfolk have plenty of time to stand around and gossip.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> even provincial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX> can be treasure troves. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dunhuang County</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum</ENAMEX>, in the center of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, overflows with <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Silk Road relics</ENAMEX>, from works of art to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2,000-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chopsticks</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX> is devoted to calligraphic rarities found in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Cave No. 17 of the Mogao Grottoes</ENAMEX>. Paper documents have survived for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a thousand years</TIMEX> in the dry climate of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">cave</ENAMEX>. In the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>, sacrificial objects unearthed in ancient tombs are shown alongside pots, a plow, and armor. Ancient handicrafts displayed in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX> include a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tang Dynasty</ENAMEX> chess set, a present from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emperor</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mogao Caves</ENAMEX>
In spite of the difficulties, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> still head for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this 2,000-year-old</TIMEX> town to see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">China‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most magnificent ancient murals and painted statues. Since you‚Äôve come this far, they‚Äôre worth another <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">25 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">15 miles</NUMEX>). 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mogao Caves</ENAMEX>, hewn from a desert cliffside, tell the story of the great flowering of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX> art in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>. Begun in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fourth century</TIMEX>, they were created in fits and starts over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next thousand years</TIMEX>. Statistics aren‚Äôt everything, but consider that there are <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">45,000 sq m</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">484,000 sq ft</NUMEX>) of mural paintings. They cover the walls and ceilings with brightly colored pictures of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and gods and speculations about eternity. And in the same caves stand <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 2,000</NUMEX> painted sculptures, realistic or fantastic. Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several hundred</NUMEX> grottoes still intact, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only a few dozen</NUMEX> are open to the public. And even these are kept locked so that visits can be supervised. The outer walls of the caves have been reinforced, with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">walkways</ENAMEX> added. Tours cover various itineraries. Here are some highlights:
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern Wei Dynasty</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">386‚Äì534</ENAMEX>). Statues with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Persian or Indian</ENAMEX> faces. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Graceful</ENAMEX>, lifelike <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> paintings with three-dimensional effects.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sui Dynasty</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">581‚Äì618</ENAMEX>). Illustrations of religious stories. <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Notice</ENAMEX> the emotions revealed in the characters‚Äô faces; also, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> robes have replaced foreign dress.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tang Dynasty</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">618‚Äì907</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Don‚Äôt miss Cave No. 96</ENAMEX>, a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">tiered</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the seventh century</TIMEX>. The seated <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buddha</ENAMEX> statue inside has toes as long as your arm. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cave No. 158</ENAMEX> is filled with a statue of the reclining <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buddha</ENAMEX>, the face unusually peaceful and godly when seen from the far left. You‚Äôll be struck by the imagination, life, and color of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tang</ENAMEX> wall paintings.
Later dynasties. Murals from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tenth</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">century</TIMEX> onward provide valuable details of everyday life in medieval <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Crescent Moon Lake</ENAMEX>
Most of the desert is grey and menacing, a sea of gravel out of which stark rocky mountains occasionally appear. But everybody‚Äôs dream desert can be seen <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a few kilometers</NUMEX> south of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dunhuang</ENAMEX>. With oases in sight, awesome dunes rise in waves to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">250-m</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">800-ft</ENAMEX>) crests. As the sun and clouds move, the colors and textures of the sand hills change.
Hidden between the hills is a small, clear lake¬†‚Äî¬†Crescent <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moon Lake</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yueyahu</ENAMEX>). It‚Äôs not a mirage. Reeds grow at the edge of this cool blue <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">spring</TIMEX> and tiny fish swim in it. You can reach the lake from the edge of the desert on the back of a camel or (if you like walking in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sand</ENAMEX>) on foot. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Twenty</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> each way should do it. Beside the pool is a magnificent <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pavilion tower</ENAMEX> with a teahouse. For a rare desert experience, climb to the top of a dune and listen to the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">musical¬†‚Äî¬†or thunderous¬†‚Äî¬†sound</ENAMEX> as the sand slides down. This is the same sound <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marco Polo</ENAMEX> heard when he passed this way on his own <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camel caravan</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">700 years ago</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guangzhou</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canton</ENAMEX>)
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Foreigners</ENAMEX> have been turning up in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guangzhou</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of thousand years</TIMEX>, for it was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">China‚Äôs</ENAMEX> first major seaport. This has made for such dramatic historical incidents as the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Opium Wars</ENAMEX>, which broke out when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> cracked down on the opium trade here. This crowded <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> has maintained its gateway role. Ever since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1957</TIMEX>, the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">biannual</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canton Trade Fair</ENAMEX> has attracted throngs of international business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. Even in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</TIMEX> of political upheaval, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guangzhou</ENAMEX> kept open the nation‚Äôs ties with foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> and with overseas <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of whom have their roots here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Guangdong Province</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guangzhou</ENAMEX> straddles the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pearl River</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China‚Äôs</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX>-longest river, which links the metropolis to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South China Sea</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">waterway</ENAMEX> provides a good deal of charm and excitement. The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> drama of ferryboats, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">freighters</ENAMEX>, junks with dirty grey sails, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">low-lying sampans¬†‚Äî¬†even</ENAMEX> small <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">tankers</ENAMEX> and big gunboats¬†‚Äî¬†unfolds right in the center of town. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">river</ENAMEX> is also used to irrigate the surrounding farmlands, which yield a cornucopia of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetables</ENAMEX>.
With a population above <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">6 million</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guangzhou</ENAMEX> is primarily an industrial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 3,200</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factories</ENAMEX>. Production lines turn out <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">buses</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX>, agricultural machinery, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemicals</ENAMEX>, and sewing machines. It is one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China‚</ENAMEX>Äôs richest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>, with new skyscrapers, expressways, and fashionable shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> to prove it. Although the economy has changed radically in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX>, many local traditions live on, including the love of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cantonese Opera</ENAMEX>, and the local dialect (incomprehensible to fellow <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX>). And then there is <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cantonese food¬†‚Äî¬†some</ENAMEX> say the world‚Äôs greatest cuisine¬†‚Äî¬†much appreciated in its adaptations internationally but unexcelled when created in its home <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guangzhou</ENAMEX> in History 
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the third century</TIMEX> b.c. the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qin Dynasty</ENAMEX> annexed the remote <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Guangzhou</ENAMEX> area, thus furnishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> with its first major seaport. By the end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Han Dynasty</ENAMEX>, foreign trade linked the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port</ENAMEX> with other areas of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX> as well as with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Empire</ENAMEX>. The name <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guangzhou</ENAMEX> was bestowed during the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kingdom of Wu</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">third century</TIMEX> a.d.), but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreigners</ENAMEX> came to call it ‚ÄúCanton.‚Äù
As commerce expanded, so did the foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of the port. By the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">ninth</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">century</TIMEX>, a large <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arabs</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Persians</ENAMEX>, and others had settled here. They traded in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX>, silk, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">porcelain</ENAMEX>, all in constant demand abroad. It was to be another <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven centuries</TIMEX> before <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Europeans</ENAMEX> established themselves in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canton</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> were first, followed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spaniards</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> tried to keep the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreigners</ENAMEX> at arm‚Äôs length, limiting their activities to certain <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">districts</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seasons</TIMEX>.
The expansion of trade did eventually bring conflict, because <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> would accept nothing less than silver bullion in payment for its exports. However, the wily <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> soon thought of an alternative commodity: opium (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41</NUMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Opium Wars</ENAMEX> ended in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1842</TIMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Treaty of Nanking</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later</TIMEX> denounced as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äúunequal‚Äù</ENAMEX>). Under the terms of the treaty, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> was compelled to open ‚ÄúCanton‚Äù and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ports</ENAMEX> to foreign penetration.
The ever shakier <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manchu Dynasty</ENAMEX> fell in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1911</TIMEX>, to be replaced by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Republic</ENAMEX>, founded by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guangdong‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most famous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">native son</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sun Yat</ENAMEX>-sen. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1927</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Communist-led</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> who established the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guangzhou Commune</ENAMEX> were wiped out by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chiang Kai-shek</ENAMEX>. During <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> occupied <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guangzhou</ENAMEX>. In the subsequent civil war, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guangzhou</ENAMEX> briefly served as the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Nationalist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> before the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Communists</ENAMEX> captured the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> and gained power nationwide in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1949</TIMEX>.
Sightseeing
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guangzhou</ENAMEX> can‚Äôt claim to compete with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Xi‚Äôan</ENAMEX> when it comes to sightseeing attractions. But its monuments and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX> are well worth visiting, not least for the chance to mingle with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cantonese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> themselves.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yue Xiu Park</ENAMEX>, near the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trade Fair</ENAMEX> in the northern part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, covers a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">93-hectare</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">230-acre</NUMEX>) site. In addition to its pretty gardens, lakes, pavilions, and sports facilities, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guangzhou‚</ENAMEX>Äôs largest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> also contains the city‚Äôs oldest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>, the red <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚ÄúTower Overlooking the Sea‚Äù</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zhenhailou</ENAMEX>). Actually, ‚Äútower‚Äù is a misleading description for this building of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> stories. Built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1380</TIMEX>, it now houses the municipal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guangzhou Bowuguan</ENAMEX>). With signs in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> is quite interesting and includes artifacts and displays recording the city‚Äôs contacts with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West</ENAMEX> (from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bibles</ENAMEX> to radios). The top floor of this watchtower <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> is now a charming teahouse.
An equally famous but modern landmark in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">granite</ENAMEX> sculptural representation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> handsome rams, based on the legend of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guangzhou‚</ENAMEX>Äôs founding. It is said that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">gods descended</ENAMEX> from heaven riding rams holding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sprigs</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX> in their mouths. The celestial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> distributed the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX>, blessing the local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with eternal freedom from famine. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gods thereupon</ENAMEX> disappeared, according to the story, but the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX>-bearing rams turned to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stone</ENAMEX>. And here they are (or at least their replicas), giving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guangzhou</ENAMEX> its nickname: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>ÄúCity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rams</ENAMEX>.‚Äù
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sun Yat-sen</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1866‚Äì1925</ENAMEX>), who began his political career in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, is honored in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yuexiu Park</ENAMEX> by an obelisk <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 m</TIMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 100 ft</TIMEX>) tall. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> is an even more impressive monument to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">statesman</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall</ENAMEX>, built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1931</TIMEX>. This vast, modern version of a traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>, with its sweeping blue-tile roofs, contains an auditorium big enough to seat <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly 5,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>.
Guangzhou‚Äôs prime <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX> monument, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Banyan Trees</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Liurongsi</ENAMEX>), was founded over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1,400 years ago</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> that inspired <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 11th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poet</ENAMEX> and calligrapher <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Su Dongpo</ENAMEX> to name the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> have died, but the often-restored <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> remains a focus of local <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX> activities. Overlooking it all is the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Flower Pagoda</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Huata</ENAMEX>), a slender relic of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Song Dynasty</ENAMEX>. From the outside, the pagoda appears to be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> tiers high, but there are really <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floors</ENAMEX> inside. Adjacent is an unusual ‚Äúdeath <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX>,‚Äù where the departed (their pictures posted on the walls) are remembered in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">prayers¬†‚Äî¬†for</ENAMEX> a fee, of course.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early medieval</TIMEX> period, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guangzhou</ENAMEX> had a significant <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> as a result of trade with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Near East</ENAMEX>. This is how it came to pass that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> has what is said to be the oldest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Huaisheng Mosque</ENAMEX> (built in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">627</NUMEX>). Its white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minaret</ENAMEX> can be climbed via a spiral staircase for a view of the courtyards, gardens, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guangzhou‚</ENAMEX>Äôs modern skyscrapers.
The city‚Äôs leading tribute to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the days</TIMEX> of imperial splendor is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chen Family Temple</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chenjiaci</ENAMEX>), a memorial to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of a large <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">merchant clan</ENAMEX> from all over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>. This sprawling <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">compound</ENAMEX> of courtyards and showy <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pavilions</ENAMEX> is decorated in a pantheon of finely carved friezes, gates, and gold-leaf tableaux depicting scenes of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> myth and romance. 
The atmosphere of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19th-century</TIMEX> colonial ‚ÄúCanton‚Äù is best evoked by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shamian Island</ENAMEX>, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pearl River</ENAMEX>, linked to central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guangzhou</ENAMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridges</ENAMEX>. This small residential enclave, shaded by banyan <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>, was the closed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> of the foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX> in the era of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Western ‚Äúconcessions.</ENAMEX>‚Äù The stately <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX>-style <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>, including old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factories</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX>, have been spruced up. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sidewalk caf√©s</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boutiques</ENAMEX>, traditional craft <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, and the stunning <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White Swan Hotel</ENAMEX> make this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guangzhou‚</ENAMEX>Äôs leading place for a stroll. 
Across from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shamian Island</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most notorious and colorful marketplace, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Qingping</ENAMEX>. A maze of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">alleys</ENAMEX> crammed with <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stalls</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qingping</ENAMEX> offers <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">up acres</NUMEX> of herbs, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spices</ENAMEX>, jade, antiques, memorabilia, goldfish, songbirds, and a sometimes nightmarish display of live <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> destined for the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX>, and rare <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>.
Among modern attractions, the flashiest is <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Oriental Studio</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guangzhou‚</ENAMEX>Äôs answer to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood‚Äôs Universal City</ENAMEX>, where <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> shows are staged on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> movie sets, one evoking notorious <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shanghai</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1930s</TIMEX>, the other a traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX> in the throes of a kungfu battle.
No visit to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guangzhou</ENAMEX> is complete without indulging in its famous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cuisine</ENAMEX>, particularly its fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seafood</ENAMEX> and delicate dim sum. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> of the best dining spots are its traditional garden <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beiyuan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Banxi</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beiyuan</ENAMEX> consists of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 40</NUMEX> dining <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pavilions</ENAMEX> and tearooms, each decorated in intricate latticework. Banxi, on the shores of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Liwan Lake</ENAMEX>, also has a classic d√©cor, with etched glass from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qing Dynasty</ENAMEX> and delicacies to match. The availability and proximity of fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ingredients</ENAMEX> is one good reason why <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cantonese</ENAMEX> food tastes so special in its <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">native city¬†‚Äî¬†almost unrecognizable</ENAMEX> from many of the simulations so prevalent abroad.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guilin</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kweilin</ENAMEX>)
China‚Äôs most famous landscapes, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of paintings, are to be found in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Guilin</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">‚Äúfinest mountains</ENAMEX> and rivers under heaven‚Äù are so inspiring that poets, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> have made this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China‚</ENAMEX>Äôs number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> natural attraction. 
The climate is subtropical, with an annual <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rainfall</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">190 cm</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">75 inches</NUMEX>), so avoid the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">rainiest season</TIMEX>, from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX> through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July</TIMEX>. An additional incentive for visiting in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">autumn</TIMEX> is the sight and fragrance of osmanthus (cassia) blossoms all over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>; in fact, the name <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guilin</ENAMEX> means ‚ÄúCassia <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Woods</ENAMEX>.‚Äù
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Tourists</ENAMEX> are so numerous in the otherwise relaxed shopping district of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guilin</ENAMEX> that the pedestrian <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">crossings</ENAMEX> have signs in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX>. Another cosmopolitan influence comes from the area‚Äôs many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minority peoples</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guilin</ENAMEX> is part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Guangxi-Zhuang Autonomous Region</ENAMEX>, which borders <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vietnam</ENAMEX>. The proliferation of so-called <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> is explained by the presence here of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of the traditionally <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim Zhuang</ENAMEX> nationality, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China‚</ENAMEX>Äôs largest minority <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. 
The geological history of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guilin</ENAMEX>, the key to the wonder of its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">moody mountains</ENAMEX> and caves, goes back <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several hundred million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>. The area was under the sea when an upheaval raised it to the status of terra firma. Later it was flooded, then lifted again in further cataclysmic events. The alternation of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">sea</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> and air through the millennia created limestone formations called karst, which eroded into pinnacles, mounds, and peaks that captivate the imagination.
Guilin was settled <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 2,000</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX> when the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Ling</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canal</ENAMEX> was built, effectively linking the great <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yangzi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pearl</ENAMEX> rivers. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guilin‚Äôs</ENAMEX> connection with one of mankind‚Äôs most ambitious engineering <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">projects</ENAMEX> was important, but otherwise little was heard from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>. It served as provincial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several hundred years</TIMEX>, and in modern times, thanks to the profusion of caves to hide in, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guilin</ENAMEX> was a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> during the war with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>. Today, rebuilt from the rubble of war, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> is thriving, thanks in large measure to its spectacular scenery.
On the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">River</ENAMEX>
The transcendent tourist experience of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guilin¬†‚Äî¬†and</ENAMEX> perhaps of all <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">China¬†‚Äî¬†is</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> trip on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Li River</ENAMEX>. The karst scenery could hardly be more romantic. But life along the river is also fascinating: washerwomen squatting on the shore, water buffalo ambling down for a dip, the improvised ferryboats, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">captive cormorant birds</ENAMEX>, their necks ringed to prevent them from swallowing all their catch, waiting for orders to go fishing from bamboo rafts.
Large, flat-bottomed tour <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> usually leave <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early in the morning</TIMEX> from the quay near the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Liberation Bridge</ENAMEX> in central <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Guilin</ENAMEX>. (In the dry <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX>, when the river is at its lowest, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> part of the journey must be undertaken by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coach</ENAMEX>.) With room for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> each, most of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX> are quiet and serve a lunch cooked en route.
Even before leaving <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, the spectacle begins. On the right <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elephant Trunk Hill</ENAMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of many peaks that romantics have endowed with animal or supernatural identities. It takes no great imagination to see the resemblance of this outcrop to an <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">elephant</ENAMEX> drinking in the river; the space between the trunk and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> has been hollowed through. The river traffic, meanwhile, keeps amateur <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">photographers</ENAMEX> snapping in all directions at flat-bottomed tubs, hand-poled bamboo rafts, sampans, and towboats.
Images unroll before the eye like a painted scroll as your <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> continues downstream: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tunneled Hill, Pagoda Hill</ENAMEX> (also known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Battleship Hill</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Washing Vase Hill</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fighting Cocks</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hills</ENAMEX> (facing each other from opposite <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX> of the river). A large <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> on the left <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dragon Gate Village</ENAMEX>, is noted for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> chestnuts and its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thousand-year-old</TIMEX> banyan <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>.
To the south is a much larger <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Daxu</ENAMEX>, with a high <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ming</ENAMEX> period called <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">‚ÄúLongevity Bridge</ENAMEX>.‚Äù Here and elsewhere, the rich, flat land produces the ingredients for a formidable fruit <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salad</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oranges</ENAMEX> and grapefruit, chestnuts and persimmons, plus exotic tropical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">delicacies</ENAMEX> all but unknown outside <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX>. Adding to the entrancing beauty of the scene, great <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stands</ENAMEX> of a feathery variety of bamboo grow along the riverbanks, forming huge cascades of green.
Beyond the village of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yangdi</ENAMEX> unfolds the uncanny scenery that prompted a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poet</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than a thousand years ago</TIMEX> to write: <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">‚ÄúThe river</ENAMEX> is a green silk belt, the mountains emerald hairpins.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù Peaks</ENAMEX> and pinnacles <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX> the river, white <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">goats</ENAMEX> pose on steep mountainsides, and an eagle soars above the cliffs. The river itself flows green and transparent. Credit for this limpid rarity goes not only to the strict antipollution standards to protect the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">River Li</ENAMEX> but also to nature itself, which endows the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> with a high content of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbonic acid</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mural Hill</ENAMEX> is so called because the sheer cliff face comprises so many patches of color that it might be a fresco. In the lights and shadows of the cliff, the shapes of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> different horses can be discerned, hence the cliff‚Äôs alternate name, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚ÄúNine Horse Hill</ENAMEX>.‚Äù Near the end of the voyage, the village of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Xinping</ENAMEX> comes into view on the left <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX>, surrounded by magical <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">scenery¬†‚Äî¬†landmarks</ENAMEX> with names like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Snail Hill</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Five Fingers Hill</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Carp Hill</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> trips end at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">county town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yangshuo</ENAMEX>, a favorite of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">poets</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painters</ENAMEX> and a destination in its own right. The distance traversed by river is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a mere 83 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">52 miles</NUMEX>), but there is no river trip like it. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">The trip</ENAMEX> back to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Guilin</ENAMEX> by bus provides yet another facet to the soaring scenery.
Sightseeing in Guilin
It‚Äôs not only the river journey that makes a visit here so rewarding. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> itself also has much to offer.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hills</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parks</ENAMEX>
The best way to appreciate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guilin‚</ENAMEX>Äôs unique setting is to climb to the summit of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of its limestone pinnacles: for example, the hill called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diecaishan</ENAMEX>, on the north side of town. The name means <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚ÄúPiled Silk Hill‚Äù or ‚ÄúFolded Brocade Hill</ENAMEX>,‚Äù a metaphor suggested by the layers of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rock</ENAMEX>. Hiking to the lookout point at the top is strenuous, but catching your breath is only one of the good reasons for stopping along the way. For instance, there is <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Breezy Cave</ENAMEX>, which cuts through the hill from south to north. It is permanently cooled by a refreshing breeze, to the great relief of grateful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowds</ENAMEX> on hot <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer days</TIMEX>. The many inscriptions carved into the cave walls over the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX> are much admired by connoisseurs of calligraphy.
At the summit, where the altitude is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">223 m</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">732 ft</ENAMEX>), the charmingly named Catch-<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Cloud Pavilion</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nayunting</ENAMEX>) provides a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">360</NUMEX>-degree panorama. The view is worth savoring: the winding river, the tile-roofed cityscape, the green flat farmland, and the surreal hills forever popping up near and far.
Closer to the city <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Fuboshan (‚ÄúWhirlpool Hill‚Äù</ENAMEX>) another natural stone <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> with a view as well as other distractions. According to legend, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Fubo</ENAMEX>, who passed this way <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2,000 years ago</TIMEX>, tested his <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">sword</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sword-Testing Stone</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stalactite</ENAMEX> formation that comes down to within <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">inches</NUMEX> of the ground. Further on, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thousand Buddha Cliff</ENAMEX> is carved with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several hundred</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">figures</ENAMEX> dating from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tang</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Song</ENAMEX> dynasties.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">District</ENAMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lakes</ENAMEX>, in the southern part of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, has been made into a delightful public <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> with gardens, walkways, and pagodas. Originally, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Banyan Tree Lake</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ronghu</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Fir Tree Lake</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shahu</ENAMEX>) were a single expanse, forming part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">moat</ENAMEX> which protected the city <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wall</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Song Dynasty</ENAMEX>-era <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Green Belt Bridge</ENAMEX> across the middle created the two lakes.
Caves
Around <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Guilin</ENAMEX>, you‚Äôll find caves of every size and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">mood¬†‚Äî¬†gloomy</ENAMEX>, inspiring, immense, or coy. Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourist itineraries</ENAMEX> take in one of the two best known caves, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reed Flute or Seven Star</ENAMEX>, on opposite sides of town.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reed Flute Cave</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ludiyan</ENAMEX>) burrows deep into a hill, while on the surface grow reeds suitable for making flutes. The visions within are strange indeed and benefit from good lighting effects. As in most other caverns, certain formations have been given poetic names. Apart from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virgin Forest</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giant Lion</ENAMEX>, there is one huge rock that suggests the form of an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Old Scholar</ENAMEX>, seated in contemplation of a simulated waterfall across the way. According to legend, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholar</ENAMEX> tried to write a poem worthy of the cave‚Äôs beauty, but before he could find adequate words he had turned to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stone</ENAMEX>. The cave‚Äôs largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX>, called the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crystal Palace</ENAMEX>, can accommodate <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a thousand</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Bats inhabit the darker recesses</ENAMEX>, but the eerie <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX> that flow through the cave have no <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Star Cave</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qixingyan</ENAMEX>) is <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a mere million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years old</TIMEX> and has been a tourist attraction for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than a thousand years</TIMEX>. Some of the scenic formations of stalactites and stalagmites have names like <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Old Banyan Tree Welcoming Guests</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dragon Splashing Water</ENAMEX>, providing an idea of the poetic license enjoyed by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cave explorers</ENAMEX>. The round-trip tour of this cave is considerably longer than the itinerary in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reed Flute Cave</ENAMEX>. Both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">underworlds</ENAMEX> have constant, comfortable temperatures <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> ‚Äòround, but they are dripping with a humidity that makes the going slippery. Another attraction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seven Star Park</ENAMEX> is its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Forest of Steles</ENAMEX>, a cliff where poems and pictures have been carved into <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rock</ENAMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past 1,500 years</TIMEX>.
An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amusement Park</ENAMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guilin‚</ENAMEX>Äôs newer attractions is the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Minorities Cultural Park</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fengqingyuan</ENAMEX>), on the eastern shore of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Li River</ENAMEX>. This ethnic amusement <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Zhuang</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dong</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miao</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minorities</ENAMEX> in traditional costumes display their native cultures, is as educational as it is entertaining. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hangzhou</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hangchow</ENAMEX>)
Several dozen lakes in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> are named ‚ÄúWest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lake</ENAMEX>,‚Äù but only one is so celebrated that it needs no further identification. It is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Lake</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xihu</ENAMEX>) in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hangzhou</ENAMEX>, on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China‚Äôs east</ENAMEX> coast. The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Song Dynasty</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Su Dongpo</ENAMEX> likened <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Lake</ENAMEX> to one of ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">China‚</ENAMEX>Äôs greatest beauties, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Xizi¬†‚Äî¬†who</ENAMEX> was also calm, soft, delicate, and enchanting. (The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hangzhou</ENAMEX> are still famous for their light, clear complexion, which is attributed to the mild, humid climate.)
But <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hangzhou</ENAMEX> has more than scenery. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Zhejiang Province</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hangzhou</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">189 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">117 miles</NUMEX>) from <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Shanghai¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†about <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three hours</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two hours</TIMEX> by bus or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> on the new toll <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>. A <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over a million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, rich in historic and cultural monuments, it also offers some educational outings. Here you can see how <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China‚</ENAMEX>Äôs major inventions, silk and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX>, are produced.
Historically, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hangzhou</ENAMEX> enjoyed 237 years of imperial glory from the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">ninth</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">century</TIMEX> onward. In all, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">kings</ENAMEX> and emperors held <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> here. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marco Polo</ENAMEX> visited in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 13th century</TIMEX>, he pronounced the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> superior to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúall others in the world, in grandeur and beauty as well as its abundant delights, which might lead an inhabitant to imagine himself in paradise.<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">‚Äù Hangzhou</ENAMEX> is the southern terminus of the world‚Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canal</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Grand Canal</ENAMEX>, which is still in use. It is said that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emperor</ENAMEX> extended it to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hangzhou</ENAMEX> so that he could choose concubines from among the city‚Äôs most beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Lake</ENAMEX>
For a full panorama of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Lake</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, go up to the viewing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platforms</ENAMEX> at a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pavilion</ENAMEX> atop <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wu Hill</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wushan</ENAMEX>), south of the lake. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">hilltop</ENAMEX> is richly forested with gingko, maple, and camphor <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>. Another vista spot is located on the summit of the hill on the north side of the lake, where the hauntingly beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baochu Pagoda</ENAMEX> stands. But the beauty of the lake can best be appreciated at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">close</NUMEX> range: from the deck of a sightseeing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> or from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">paths</ENAMEX> and causeways along its shore. The lake edge is abundantly supplied with <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>, and (unusual in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>) secluded places where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lovers</ENAMEX> can find privacy.
The highlight of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> trip across <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Lake</ENAMEX> is the largest of three man-made islands, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúsmall fairy island‚Äù</ENAMEX> known as <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Three Pools Mirroring the Moon</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santan Yinyue</ENAMEX>). The island, created in the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Ming Dynasty</ENAMEX>, was ingeniously provided with an island of its own, in the center of its own lake. A zigzag <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX> will get you there. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> small <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stone pagodas</ENAMEX>, rebuilt in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th century</TIMEX>, rise from the main lake just south of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">isle</ENAMEX>. On <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the night</TIMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Moon Festival</ENAMEX>, candles are placed inside the pagodas. The flickering light emanating from the small round windows gives the lake <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> reflections imitating the real moon.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Solitary Hill</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gushan</ENAMEX>), in the northern part of the lake, is reached from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> by a causeway named after a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tang Dynasty</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poet</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baijuyi</ENAMEX>. In the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">ninth</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">century</TIMEX> he was demoted from a high imperial post to the job of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hangzhou</ENAMEX> because he wrote poems satirizing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX>. This made him popular with the ordinary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. The hillsides are brightened by <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> and pavilions. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Zhejiang</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Provincial Museum</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Solitary Hill</ENAMEX> contains the oldest <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">grains</ENAMEX> of cultivated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX> in the world, harvested <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7,000 years ago</TIMEX>. 
From <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monastery</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Plantation</ENAMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the country‚Äôs best-known <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX> monasteries, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hangzhou‚Äôs Lingyin Temple (‚ÄúSpirits‚Äô Retreat‚Äù</ENAMEX>), west of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Lake</ENAMEX>, attracts <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowds</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">believers</ENAMEX>. The monks¬†‚Äî¬†for this is a working <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monastery¬†‚Äî¬†are</ENAMEX> kept busy supplying joss (incense) sticks to devout or merely fun-loving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>. The main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX> contains a statue of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buddha</ENAMEX> seated on a lotus leaf. Carved of camphorwood, it is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">191‚ÅÑ2 m</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">64</NUMEX> ft) high and thought to be the largest such sculpture in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>. Nearby, the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚ÄúPeak That Flew</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Afar‚Äù</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Feilaifeng</ENAMEX>) shelters <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">380</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX> stone <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carvings</ENAMEX> created during the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yuan Dynasty</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> sacred caves. The most famous sculpture is of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laughing Buddha</ENAMEX> with a bulging belly, an animated figure fashioned <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about a thousand years ago</TIMEX>.
Further southwest into the lush <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Lake hills</ENAMEX> is the village of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dragon Well</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hangzhou‚Äôs</ENAMEX> celebrated <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Longjing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> is cultivated. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">villagers</ENAMEX> welcome <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> who arrive by local <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bus</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bicycle</ENAMEX>, sharing cups of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> and selling the precious leaves. On the way, it‚Äôs worth a stop at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China Tea Museum</ENAMEX>, a recently expanded attraction with displays of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ceremonial tea</ENAMEX> implements and its own <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> teahouses.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hangzhou</ENAMEX> is also renowned for its silks. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hangzhou Silk and Satin Printing</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dyeing Complex</ENAMEX> is the largest in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>. Tours follow the production process from the sorting of cocoons, which arrive by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">barge</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20-kg</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">44-pound</NUMEX>) sacks, to the silk-screen printing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stage</ENAMEX>. At the end of the line is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop</ENAMEX> where foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>, exploiting their newly gained expertise, browse through the bolts of silk.
Other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX> with tours and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> are devoted to traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicines</ENAMEX> and pottery. The lakeside promenade also provides plenty of shopping and small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>. But the essence of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hangzhou</ENAMEX> is its scenery. The lake and hills afford some of the most scenic walking and bicycling of any <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harbin</ENAMEX>
Only an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eskimo</ENAMEX>, you would think, could survive <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Harbin</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China‚</ENAMEX>Äôs northeastern-most <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Heilongjiang</ENAMEX>. The average temperature stays below freezing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five months of the year</TIMEX>, and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mercury</ENAMEX> has been known to descend to -38¬∞C (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-36¬∞F</ENAMEX>).
In a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> of ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Harbin</ENAMEX> is an anomaly. Until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 20th century</TIMEX> it never amounted to more than a fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX>. Then the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manchu Dynasty</ENAMEX> agreed to let <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Czarist Russia</ENAMEX> build a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> of the Trans-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Siberian Railway</ENAMEX> through <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Harbin</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russians</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreigners</ENAMEX> peopled the fast-growing transportation <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hub</ENAMEX>, which soon boasted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX>, bars and gambling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>. With the Bolshevik revolution of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1917</TIMEX>, perhaps <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half a million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian √©migr√©s</ENAMEX> fled through <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Siberia</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Harbin</ENAMEX>, consolidating the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> appearance of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> with more pastel-colored stucco <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX> with onion <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">domes</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">From 1932 to 1945</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Harbin</ENAMEX> was under <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> occupation, followed by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one year</TIMEX> under the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1946</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese Communists</ENAMEX> took control of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. Under the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">People‚Äôs Republic</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Harbin</ENAMEX> has become an important industrial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">center</ENAMEX> as well as the heart of a rich grain-producing area.
At the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lunar</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">New Year</TIMEX>, or Spring <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Festival</ENAMEX> (in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late January</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early February</TIMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harbin</ENAMEX> puts on its keystone event: a spectacular show to rival the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Snow Festival</ENAMEX> of its sister <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sapporo</ENAMEX>. While the rest of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> is celebrating with paper lanterns, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Harbin</ENAMEX> is showing off with lanterns carved out of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> in its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ice</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Lantern Festival</ENAMEX>, held downtown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Zhaolin Park</ENAMEX>. Delicate sculptures and whole <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> made of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> are brilliantly illuminated. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">It‚Äôs</ENAMEX> so festive, you might forget the cold.
The mighty <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Songhua River</ENAMEX>, running through <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Harbin</ENAMEX> from west to east, inevitably attracts <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer months</TIMEX> there are sightseeing launches and, for the brave, swimming. On the south <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stalin Park</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jiangpan Gongyuan</ENAMEX>) is a wide, inviting promenade, with its <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Flood Control Monument</ENAMEX> the chief focal point for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendors</ENAMEX>. Visible from shore is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sun Island</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tai Yangdao</ENAMEX>), in the middle of the river, a mixture of health <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX>, beach installations, and gardens. It now boasts <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Siberia Tiger Park</ENAMEX>, a large animal preserve where endangered <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">tigers</ENAMEX>, dodging tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">buses</ENAMEX>, train to hunt live <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">prey</ENAMEX> before their release into the wild.
The main walking district, the cobblestone <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Daoli Old Town</ENAMEX>, bordered by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stalin Park</ENAMEX>, retains much of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Harbin‚Äôs Russian</ENAMEX> heritage in its onion-domed architecture. Other attractions include the inactive but spectacular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santa Sophia Church</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> active temples. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sixth-century</TIMEX> stone tablets grace <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wenmiao, Harbin‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Confucius</ENAMEX>, while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jilesi</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple of Bliss</ENAMEX> (the largest in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX>) hosts an active <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> of monks and nuns and opens onto a large, lively street market.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the darker attractions is the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Exhibition Hall</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Ruins of the Japanese Troops Invading China</ENAMEX>, site of a secret biological warfare <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> set up by the occupying <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1939</TIMEX>. Its existence was hidden until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1980s</TIMEX>. A brighter site is <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Harbin‚Äôs Children‚Äôs Park</ENAMEX>, where there is a miniature <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">railway</ENAMEX> operated by children¬†‚Äî¬†the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> of its kind in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>. Small <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trains</ENAMEX> carry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> of all ages from <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚ÄúHarbin Station‚</ENAMEX>Äù to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">‚ÄúBeijing Station</ENAMEX>,‚Äù a distance of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">just over a mile</NUMEX>) here, but, in reality, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,388 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">862 miles</NUMEX>).
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hohhot</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Huhehot</ENAMEX>)
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hohhot</ENAMEX> is a sprawling, booming <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> with a metropolitan <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than one million</NUMEX>. The center of town looks to the future with new official <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>, housing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">blocks</ENAMEX>, and wide <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">avenues</ENAMEX>, but the traffic evokes nostalgia with its parade of donkey <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">carts</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ox carts</ENAMEX>, pony <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">carts</ENAMEX>, and farm <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">tractors</ENAMEX>, plus the usual proliferation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bicycles</ENAMEX>.
It might come as a surprise that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mongolians</ENAMEX> are only a small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minority</ENAMEX> here. Most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hohhot</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Han</ENAMEX> (ethnic <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX>), and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Inner Mongolia‚</ENAMEX>Äôs close connection with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> dates back <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several centuries</TIMEX>. For <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> in search of the exotic, though, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hohhot</ENAMEX> and vicinity offer many opportunities to make contact with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mongolian</ENAMEX> traditions. You can drink <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">butter tea</ENAMEX> with millet and sleep in a yurt, a felt-covered circular tent.
A quite unexpected feature of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hohhot</ENAMEX> is its modern racecourse. Under the sky-blue <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">domes</ENAMEX> of the reviewing stand, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> are often treated to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Mongolian ‚Äúrodeo‚Äù</ENAMEX> of racing and trick riding and perhaps a procession of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-humped camels. Another lively spot is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xinhua Square</ENAMEX>, where <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> seems to exercise and play before work, returning <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">each evening</TIMEX> to sample the kebabs and other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX> fare from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozens</NUMEX> of food <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stalls</ENAMEX>. Along nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> peddlers shout out their wares with equal enthusiasm, whether they‚Äôre selling shirts, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetables</ENAMEX>, or sunglasses. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cobblers</ENAMEX> work hand-cranked sewing machines in the open air. A bard, banging a cymbal, chants a story, while his <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">partner¬†‚Äî¬†a trained monkey¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†dons the masks and hats of various <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> opera <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX>, mesmerizing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Inner Mongolia Museum</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nei Mengu Bowuguan</ENAMEX>) has an ample display of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">native yurts</ENAMEX> and riding gear, as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China‚</ENAMEX>Äôs largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dinosaur skeleton</ENAMEX>. Among sacred sites, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xiletuzhao Temple</ENAMEX> stands out. It is an active <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Lamaist Buddhist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrine</ENAMEX>, with many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Tibetan</ENAMEX> trappings. Attractive to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">photographers</ENAMEX> is the aptly named <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Five Pagodas Temple</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wutasi</ENAMEX>), a striking <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> capped with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">towers</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX> scriptures are inscribed on the outer <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wall</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sanskrit</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tibetan</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mongolian</ENAMEX>, along with carvings of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,600</NUMEX> figures.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Great Mosque</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qingzhen Dasi</ENAMEX>), built in the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Ming Dynasty</ENAMEX>, serves the large <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hui Muslim</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> that lives in the neighborhood. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX> has a minaret that culminates in a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese-style</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> roof (topped by a crescent). The front of the prayer <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX> is adorned with <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Arabic</ENAMEX> inscriptions and ceramic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">abstractions</ENAMEX>.
Hohhot‚Äôs oldest historical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">site</ENAMEX>, situated <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">17 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">11 miles</NUMEX>) southwest of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, is the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Tomb of Princess Zhaojun</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zhaojunmu</ENAMEX>). In <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">33 b.c.</TIMEX>, at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the age of 18</TIMEX>, this famous <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> beauty married a tribal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX>, thus bringing about what is now hailed as peace among the nationalities. You can take a stroll to the top of the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">33-m</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">98</NUMEX>-ft) earthen pyramid built above her grave and, from here, look out over the endless, flat farmland.
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Southeast</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hohhot</ENAMEX> is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 12th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">White Pagoda</ENAMEX>, known in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Chinese</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wanbuhua Yanjingta</ENAMEX>: the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pagoda</ENAMEX> of the Ten <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Thousand Scriptures</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX>-tier octagonal structure, standing all alone in farmland, was constructed of brick <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about 900 years ago</TIMEX> and recently restored.
The Grasslands
The most memorable aspect of a visit to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hohhot</ENAMEX> is likely to be an excursion to the grasslands, across the desolate <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Daqing Mountains</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">horseback</ENAMEX> riding is a way of life among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mongolians</ENAMEX>. A good paved <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> eases the strain of the zigzag climb that continues up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 2,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 6,500</NUMEX> ft) above sea level.
Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> end up at either <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Xilamuren</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gegentala</ENAMEX>. At these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourist camps</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guests</ENAMEX> sleep in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wool</ENAMEX>-felt yurts with quilts, hot water flasks, and electric lights. Bathing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> and dining <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">halls</ENAMEX> are often in separate <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>. Daily activities can include archery, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mongolian</ENAMEX> wrestling, visits to local <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">villages</ENAMEX>, and horseback riding on the celebrated grasslands. Folk dancing and singing provide <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</TIMEX> entertainment.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Visitors</ENAMEX> might also be treated to an informal rodeo in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mongolian</ENAMEX> horsemen race their energetic ponies. Disarmingly, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cowboys</ENAMEX> are dressed like ordinary <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Tourists</ENAMEX> are then offered the chance to ride camels (stepladders are provided for mounting these <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mild-mannered animals</ENAMEX>) and ponies.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Travelers</ENAMEX> with more time can venture deeper into the wilderness grasslands, where there is a better chance of sleeping in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a real yurt</TIMEX>, not one specially furnished for foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>. Other popular destinations west of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hohhot</ENAMEX> are the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Genghis Khan Mausoleum</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ordoes Highlands</ENAMEX> (actually built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1954</TIMEX> and recently augmented with a reconstructed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yuan Dynasty</ENAMEX> village) and the nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Resonant Sand Gorge</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wudang Lama Temple</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Huangshan</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hwang Shan</ENAMEX>)
Although <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">‚ÄúYellow Mountain‚</ENAMEX>Äù is the literal translation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Huangshan</ENAMEX> (which is not one mountain but a range of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozens</NUMEX> of peaks), yellow is not the color that <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> comes to mind when describing this romantic site that has been the subject of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> poetry and painting for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX>. In reality, green is the color of the stunted pines clinging to purple cliff faces. Pink are the wildflowers, blue the sky, and white the sea of clouds that rolls in beneath the rocky pinnacles.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Huangshan</ENAMEX> is the only region of eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China‚Äôs Anhui Province</ENAMEX> that appears on major tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">itineraries</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trains</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planes</ENAMEX> link <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shanghai</ENAMEX> with a terminus at the foot of the mountains, where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coaches</ENAMEX> continue the journey. The scenic mountain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> now has hotel <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX>, from extremely basic to comfortable. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tourists¬†‚Äî¬†and poets¬†‚Äî¬†might</ENAMEX> spend <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a week</TIMEX> or more exploring the mountains, but foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> try to squeeze it all into a day or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>.
The weather can be a critical factor in the pleasure of mountain <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">rambles</ENAMEX> and sightseeing. On average, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-July to the end of September</TIMEX> is considered the most dependable time of year because of the mild temperatures and relatively restrained <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rainfall</ENAMEX>. Drizzle rather than heavy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rain</ENAMEX> generally falls from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late May to late June</TIMEX>, when the spring <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> burst forth, but temperatures are brisk. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mist</ENAMEX> and fog often enhance the views.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Huangshan</ENAMEX> has many peaks that are well known by name in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>, often through <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of poems describing these as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most beautiful mountains. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> principal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">summits</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lotus Flower Peak</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lianhuafeng</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bright Summit</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guangmingding</ENAMEX>), and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heavenly Capital Peak</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tiandufeng</ENAMEX>). All are <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">over 1,800 m</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6,000 ft</NUMEX>) and all can be climbed via endless stone stairs, some as steep as ladders.
Climbs begin on the east side of the range at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yungu Temple</ENAMEX>, where a cable car whisks some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> to the summit while most begin an <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8-km</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5-mile</NUMEX>) hike. At the twin <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">summits</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Northern</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Western Sea of Clouds</ENAMEX>, there are a large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX> and smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">inns</ENAMEX>, the place to get some rest before viewing the sunrise. The descent on the west side is longer, with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">up to 14 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">9 miles</NUMEX>) of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">paths</ENAMEX> and stairs. When hiking becomes too strenuous, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Huangshan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> can recuperate in a hot spring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> between <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Purple Cloud Peak</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ziyunfeng</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peach Blossom Peak</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taohuafeng</ENAMEX>). Here, piping hot water with a curative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mineral</ENAMEX> content bubbles from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the spring year</TIMEX> ‚Äòround. You can drink it, bathe in it, or both.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Huangshan</ENAMEX> phenomenon that has most inspired <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painters</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">photographers</ENAMEX> is the sight of cottony clouds nuzzling the mountainsides. The peaks and pinnacles, jutting above the clouds in the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early morning</TIMEX> sky, look like islets in a celestial sea. If there‚Äôs a single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> for classic <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> landscape painting, it‚Äôs surely <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Huangshan</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jinan</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tsinan</ENAMEX>)
Sweet <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> gushes from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than 100 springs</TIMEX> within the city limits of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jinan</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shandong</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shantung</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Province</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> enhances agriculture and industry and even turns this ‚ÄúCity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Springs‚</ENAMEX>Äù into a tourist attraction. And thanks to nature‚Äôs generosity, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jinan</ENAMEX> is the only <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> where you can safely drink the tap <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>. Even so, most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> only pass through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jinan</ENAMEX> on their way to such traditional sights of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shandong</ENAMEX> as the holy mountain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taishan</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">163</NUMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Qufu</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">birthplace</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Confucius</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">195</NUMEX>).
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Jinan</ENAMEX> area seems to have been inhabited since the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Stone Age</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">More than 2,500</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX>, a town <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wall</ENAMEX> was built. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jinan</ENAMEX> has been a prosperous provincial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> since the medieval period. At <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the turn of the 20th century</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manchu Dynasty</ENAMEX> granted foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concessions</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jinan</ENAMEX>, prompting an influx of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Europeans</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> was a focus of bitter fighting during the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Chinese Civil War</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than a million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> live in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>.
Sightseeing starts among the weeping willows along the shores of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lake</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Great Light</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daminghu</ENAMEX>), in the northern part of the old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX> the lake has been dredged and stone <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">embankments</ENAMEX> built. All around it are <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">playgrounds</ENAMEX>, and pavilions.
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Southeast</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thousand Buddha Mountain</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qianfoshan</ENAMEX>), but instead of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a thousand</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buddha</ENAMEX> images you‚Äôll find <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a hundred today</TIMEX>. And, at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">only 280 m</TIMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 900 ft</TIMEX>) above sea level, it is more a hill than a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúmountain</ENAMEX>.‚Äù But a hike up the hill and down again permits a close look at old temples, grottoes with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX> statues, and refreshing forests.
Of all the springs in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jinan</ENAMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> with the most historical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jet Spring</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baotuquan</ENAMEX>). It was from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this spring</TIMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th century</TIMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qing Dynasty</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Emperor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kangxi</ENAMEX> took a swig and pronounced it the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚ÄúFirst Spring Under Heaven</ENAMEX>.‚Äù It is now surrounded by a carefully landscaped <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>. A short walk away is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Black Tiger</ENAMEX> Spring (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heihuquan</ENAMEX>), its sweet <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> roaring from the mouths of three tigers carved in a black <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stone cliffside</ENAMEX>.
As the provincial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jinan</ENAMEX> is the site of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shandong Provincial Museum</ENAMEX>, where <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 400,000</NUMEX> items illustrate local history and nature. The highlight of the collection is an exhibition of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Longshan Black Pottery</ENAMEX> found near <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Jinan¬†‚Äî¬†an</ENAMEX> elegant, delicate ware fired <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4,000 years ago</TIMEX>. 
Kaifeng
The ancient walled <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kaifeng</ENAMEX>, located in eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Henan</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Honan</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Province</ENAMEX>, lies near enough to the unpredictable <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Yellow River</ENAMEX> to have known more than its share of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">catastrophes¬†‚Äî¬†and</ENAMEX> when it wasn‚Äôt being flooded it was being pillaged. The most terrible of the invasions, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 12th century</TIMEX>, ended the dreams of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern Song Dynasty</ENAMEX> and left <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kaifeng</ENAMEX> in ruins. All things considered, it‚Äôs almost miraculous that several historic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> have survived to this day. So, remarkably, has much of the city‚Äôs old imperial dignity.
Kaifeng rose to fame <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 2,000</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX> during the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Warring States</ENAMEX> period, when it was capital of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kingdom of Wei</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">220‚Äì265</ENAMEX>). The city‚Äôs most prosperous and glorious era was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between the years 960 and 1127</TIMEX>, when it was the Eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Capital of the Northern Song Dynasty</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Iron Pagoda</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tieta</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kaifeng‚</ENAMEX>Äôs best known <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">symbol</ENAMEX>, only looks as if it‚Äôs made of iron. The exterior walls are faced with glazed bricks and tiles of an iron-like hue. Built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1049</TIMEX> and restored in modern times, it is a lucky <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">13 tiers</NUMEX> tall. It was originally part of a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixth-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">monastery complex</ENAMEX>, but the other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> were washed away in one of the great floods of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th century</TIMEX>. Another relic of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Song Dynasty</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> and imposing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pota (‚ÄúPagoda</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Po Family‚Äù</ENAMEX>) reveals none of the high-flying grace of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iron Pagoda</ENAMEX>. This might be excused by the fact that the top <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> tiers of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> collapsed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several hundred years ago</TIMEX>.
In the northwest <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">quarter</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Imperial Way of the Song</ENAMEX> emperors has been reconstructed. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tile-roofed</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> line the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> blocks, terminating at the entrance to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Dragon Pavilion Park</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Longtingyuan</ENAMEX>). Its double-decker <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">central pavilion</ENAMEX>, with upswept golden roofs, was reconstructed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th-century</TIMEX>.
West from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Dragon Pavilion Park</ENAMEX> along the lakeshore is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stele Forest</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Imperial Academy</ENAMEX>, an outdoor arena with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 3,000</NUMEX> ancient carved <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tablets</ENAMEX>. Nearby is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kaifeng‚</ENAMEX>Äôs newest tourist attraction, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Qingming Park Up the River</ENAMEX>, a theme <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> modeled after a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">scroll</ENAMEX> picturing festive and imperial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kaifeng</ENAMEX>. 
At the center of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kaifeng</ENAMEX>, the main attraction is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xiangguo Monastery</ENAMEX>, founded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the sixth century</TIMEX>. Inside is the gilded statue of the ‚ÄúThousand-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Armed</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Thousand</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eyed Buddha</ENAMEX>,‚Äù which (incredibly) has more than the advertised number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX> and eyes. Outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> is a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the city‚</TIMEX>Äôs liveliest and largest open-air market, complete with dancing monkeys.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> migrated to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kaifeng</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about the tenth century</TIMEX>. They established a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">synagogue</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1163</TIMEX> and maintained a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> until the great flood of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1852</TIMEX>. Although assimilated, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as many as a hundred</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Kaifeng</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> still claim <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> heritage. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stone</ENAMEX> tablets recording the history of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kaifeng</ENAMEX> are stored in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kaifeng Museum</ENAMEX>. The grounds of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Purity</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Truth Synagogue</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qingzhensi</ENAMEX>), north of a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catholic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> and east of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX>, can still be located with the help of local guides.
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Kunming</ENAMEX>
Flights into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kunming</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yunnan Province</ENAMEX>, land on an unexpectedly <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">long</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">runway</ENAMEX> that has a dramatic history, commemorated neither by plaques nor monuments. This was once the end of the line for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Flying Tigers</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> who supplied <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War</ENAMEX> II. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kunming</ENAMEX> was also the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terminus</ENAMEX> for supplies traveling down the tortuous <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Burma Road</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">milestone ‚Äú0‚Äù¬†‚Äî¬†otherwise unmarked¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†can be seen on the right side of the road <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">21 km</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">13 miles</NUMEX>) from the center of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kunming</ENAMEX>, on the edge of the Western <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hills</ENAMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kunming‚</ENAMEX>Äôs best attractions is its benign climate. At an altitude of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,894 m</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 6,200</NUMEX> ft), temperatures are pleasantly mild, producing what is described as perpetual springtime. During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one season</TIMEX> or another the camellia, azalea, magnolia, and begonia are in flower, and the region is renowned as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China‚</ENAMEX>Äôs pharmacopoeia. The thatched roofs of farmhouses are draped with drying <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">corn</ENAMEX> and chili peppers.
The total metropolitan <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> stands at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2 million</NUMEX>, of which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> live in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> proper. To make it all the more exotic, a high proportion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> belong to minority nationalities and often appear in ethnic costumes. The city‚Äôs leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">university</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institute for Nationalities</ENAMEX>, enrolls over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20,000</NUMEX> minority <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>.
Downtown <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kunming</ENAMEX> has modernized rapidly, but there are still a few touches of the old, the exotic, and the scenic: a colorful <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bird</ENAMEX> and flower market, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nancheng Ancient Mosque</ENAMEX>, the blind <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">masseurs</ENAMEX> who work outside in the public <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Workers‚Äô Cultural Hall</ENAMEX>. A few charming older neighborhoods remain around the city‚Äôs main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Green Lake</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cuihui</ENAMEX>), and the lake is charming, too, particularly on a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> visit and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> when the ‚Äúlaughing gulls‚Äù stop over on their way from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Siberia</ENAMEX>.
Then there‚Äôs Kunming‚Äôs most interesting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Qiongzhusi</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bamboo Temple</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">13 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">8 miles</NUMEX>) northwest of downtown. It houses the surreal work of a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sculptor</ENAMEX> who created a version of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> arhats (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">followers</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buddha</ENAMEX>) unequaled at any other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>.
Kunming‚Äôs prime scenic and recreational area is at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lake Dian</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China‚Äôs</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">sixth</NUMEX> largest. Tour <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> cruise the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">crystal waters</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Grand View Park</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daguan Gongyuan</ENAMEX>), on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> shore, provides the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> for which <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kunming</ENAMEX> is famous, along with arched <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridges</ENAMEX> and pavilions. On the opposite shore, the rich green <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">slopes</ENAMEX> of the Western <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hills</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xishan</ENAMEX>) rise abruptly. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> newer attraction on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lake Dian</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yunnan Nationalities Village</ENAMEX>, an ethnic theme <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> exhibiting <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> minority <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mini-villages</ENAMEX>, probably the best such <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>.
A strenuous climb up the sheer face of the Western <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hills</ENAMEX> via <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tunnels</ENAMEX> and stair treads carved from stone ultimately leads to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Dragon‚Äôs Gate</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Longmen</ENAMEX>). During the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ming Dynasty</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emperor</ENAMEX> was carried all the way up from the lakeside by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> bearers. There are several excellent places to stop and catch your breath on the way up, including a teahouse, a former <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">concubines‚Äô residence</ENAMEX>, and an emperor‚Äôs temporary living <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">quarters</ENAMEX>. The gate itself is wide enough for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> to pass through at a time. Caves painstakingly cut into the mountainside contain colorful painted carvings, all the work of a single-minded <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Daoist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">monk</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 18th century</TIMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">followers</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stone Forest</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shilin</ENAMEX>)
From <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kunming</ENAMEX> it‚Äôs just <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">80 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 miles</NUMEX>) southeast to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yunnan‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most popular scenic attraction, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stone Forest</ENAMEX>. This is an otherworldly fantasy of twisted limestone <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">hundreds of millions of</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years old</TIMEX>, the world‚Äôs largest natural stone <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">maze</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Geologists</ENAMEX> say this wonder originated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">200 million years ago</TIMEX> with the interaction of limestone, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">sea</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, rainwater, and seismic upheavals. The bizarre pinnacles that resulted are of the distinctive type of limestone called karst, the same geology <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> finds in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Guilin</ENAMEX>. 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stone Forest</ENAMEX> covers <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 26,000 hectares</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">64,000 acres</NUMEX>) of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yunnan Province</ENAMEX>, but most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> confine themselves to a manageable area of concentrated wonders. Here there are paved <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">paths</ENAMEX>, protective railings, and a few painted signs, but it is indeed possible to lose one‚Äôs way inside this massive labyrinth. Near the starting point, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> from the neighboring <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sani</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tribe</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Yi</ENAMEX> nationality) sell embroidered blouses, bags, and assorted knickknacks. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sani</ENAMEX> also work as freelance guides. In an open area beyond a grove of giant bamboo is the formal entrance to the forest: a wall carved with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚ÄúShilin</ENAMEX>.‚Äù
Many of the formations resemble particular <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> out of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> classics. You will find one pinnacle in the image of an ‚ÄúElephant on a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stone Terrace‚Äù</ENAMEX> and another like a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚ÄúRhinoceros Looking at the Moon</ENAMEX>.‚Äù At <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> point in the maze you must squeeze through the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Narrowest Pass</ENAMEX>; doing so, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Sani</ENAMEX> legend, adds <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten years</TIMEX> to your life. From <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Peak Viewing Pavilion</ENAMEX>, the highest point in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stone Forest</ENAMEX>, there‚Äôs a comprehensive view of this great thicket of jagged rocks thrusting skyward.
The biggest open space in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stone Forest</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">lawn</ENAMEX> surrounded by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cherry</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>, is the site of a <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Sani festival</ENAMEX> each <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June</TIMEX>. For <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">48 continuous hours</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">tribesmen</ENAMEX> devote themselves to singing and dancing, wrestling matches, bullfights (actually, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water buffalo</ENAMEX> fighting each other), feasting, and romancing. Many of the celebrants come from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tree Village</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wukeshu</ENAMEX>), across <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Shilin Lake</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX>. This <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several thousand</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Sani</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> shelters <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water buffalo</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pigs</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">goats</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sani</ENAMEX> themselves live in thatched-roof, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mud</ENAMEX>-and-wattle <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>.
Those who stay the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stone Forest</ENAMEX> are usually entertained with a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Sani</ENAMEX> folklore show. Among the instruments in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">orchestra</ENAMEX> are flutes, zithers, and a giant <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">banjo</ENAMEX> with a hollow bottom. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Women dancers</ENAMEX> wear red, white, and black conical hats, while the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> sport floppy black turbans. Through song and mime they recount the legends that link their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to the otherworldly presence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stone Forest</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lanzhou</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lanchow</ENAMEX>)
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> legendary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">thoroughfares</ENAMEX> pass through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lanzhou</ENAMEX>: the broad, powerful <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Yellow River</ENAMEX> and the ancient trade route known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Silk Road</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> the big, busy <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> boasts broad new boulevards as well as intriguing old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>. Adding local color, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of minority nationalities¬†‚Äî¬†mostly <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim Hui</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tibetans¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†contribute their own <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">customs</ENAMEX>, costumes, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cuisine</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cosmopolitan mix</ENAMEX>. In some neighborhoods the pavements are crowded with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äúfree market‚Äù peddlers</ENAMEX> and artisans.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lanzhou</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gansu</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kansu</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Province</ENAMEX>, which extends from the farmland of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Yellow River</ENAMEX> basin through the narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gansu</ENAMEX> corridor, with its steep rocky mountains, to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China‚</ENAMEX>Äôs far west of desert and oases. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lanzhou</ENAMEX> received its name under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sui Dynasty</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than a thousand years ago</TIMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent times</TIMEX> its role as a transportation <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> has strengthened with the spread of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">railways</ENAMEX> and air routes. Industrial development here since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1949</TIMEX> has transformed the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, adding vast new suburbs of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">refineries</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factories</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of the metropolitan area now tops <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2 million</NUMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gansu Provincial Museum</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sheng Bowuguan</ENAMEX>), just across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> from the big Soviet-style <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Huaiyi Hotel</ENAMEX>, houses <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Silk Road treasures</ENAMEX> and perhaps the most famous sculpture in all of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">galloping ‚ÄúFlying Horse</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gansu</ENAMEX>.‚Äù With its right rear leg touching a symbolic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bird</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gansu</ENAMEX> horse is the subject of countless reproductions at home and abroad. The original bronze was found in an ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Han Dynasty</ENAMEX> tomb in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gansu Province</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1969</TIMEX>. You can buy a bronze copy in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> shop¬†‚Äî¬†for a tidy sum.
For a view of the muddy, swiftly moving <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Yellow River</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> along its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX>, go along to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">White Pagoda Hill Park</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baitashan Gongyuan</ENAMEX>), once a military stronghold. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> itself, an octagonal <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX>-tier structure, was rebuilt in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 15th century</TIMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Springs Hill Park</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wuquanshan Gongyuan</ENAMEX>) climbs a steep mountainside on the opposite <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX> of the river. The springs provide <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> for various needs, from making <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> to ensuring fertility. To break up the climb there are temples and pavilions to visit and a big pond crossed by a crooked <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX>. The temples date from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 14th century</TIMEX>; one artifact, a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5-ton</NUMEX> bronze bell, was <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cast</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1202</TIMEX>.
West of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lanzhou</ENAMEX> are the magnificent <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Thousand Buddha Temple</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Caves</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Binglingsi Shiku</ENAMEX>), with ancient frescoes and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of statues, and, at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xiahe</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Labrang Monastery</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Labolengsi</ENAMEX>), one of the largest and most active lamaseries outside of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tibet</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Southeast</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lanzhou</ENAMEX>, requiring an overnight visit, is one of the most celebrated of the great <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX> grottoes, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maijishan Caves</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maijishan Shiku</ENAMEX>), dating back to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fourth century</TIMEX>.
Leshan
From the provincial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chengdu</ENAMEX>, a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three-hour</TIMEX> drive via a new expressway through populous <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sichuan</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Szechuan</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Province</ENAMEX> ends at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leshan</ENAMEX>, the base for visits to a monumental riverside <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buddha</ENAMEX> and to one of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> sacred mountains of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buddhism, Emeishan</ENAMEX>. A <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poet</ENAMEX> wrote that the most beautiful scenery of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> is found in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sichuan</ENAMEX>, and, indeed, some of the best of that scenery is concentrated in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Leshan</ENAMEX>. Here, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> rivers converge and flow along the city <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wall</ENAMEX>, and far away in the mist rises <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mt. Emei</ENAMEX>.
Open <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> ferry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leshan</ENAMEX> to the site of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Great Buddha</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dafo</ENAMEX>). Whether seen from the river or, later, from the hillsides, the world‚Äôs largest seated <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buddha</ENAMEX> is an impressive spectacle. Carved from the cliffside by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">monk</ENAMEX> starting in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year 713</TIMEX>, its height is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">71 m</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">233 ft</ENAMEX>). The statue‚Äôs feet are so big that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> can sit on each instep. 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> tie up some distance from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buddha</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> climb from the shore to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dark Green Temple</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wuyousi</ENAMEX>), with its view of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mt. Emei</ENAMEX>, the gate to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Western Paradise</ENAMEX>. A pathway and suspension bridge lead back to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Great Buddha</ENAMEX>. There, the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Stairs of Nine Turnings</ENAMEX> wind steeply down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> side of the statue to the feet. Another honeycombed stairway carved from the cliff leads back up the other side, coming out level with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buddha‚</ENAMEX>Äôs massive crown, where you have a view of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buddha‚</ENAMEX>Äôs serene and knowing countenance. More temples and caves lie on the road back to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> landing and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">buses</ENAMEX> to the sacred peak. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mt. Emei</ENAMEX> 
Dubbed <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúthe</ENAMEX> fairest mountain among the fair mountains of the world,<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">‚Äù Mt. Emei</ENAMEX> reaches an altitude of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">well over 3,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">over 10,000 ft</NUMEX>). You don‚Äôt have to climb all the way to the summit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Emeishan</ENAMEX> to appreciate its charm and mystique. But the higher you go, the more chance you‚Äôll have of sighting the rich <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fauna</ENAMEX> of the hill <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">forests</ENAMEX>, from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">gregarious monkeys</ENAMEX> to red pandas. This was the traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX> ‚ÄúPeak of the West,‚Äù the mountain <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrine</ENAMEX> to countless pilgrims, emperors included.
At the foot of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mt. Emei</ENAMEX> are <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Loyalty</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Country Temple</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baoguosi</ENAMEX>) and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crouching Tiger Temple</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fuhusi</ENAMEX>), foreshadowing the many temples ahead. There are monasteries and famous scenic spots <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">every few kilometers</NUMEX> along the paths to the summit, but this is a climb (for the energetic only) that requires <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several days</TIMEX>. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> have time to spend <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">only a night</TIMEX> on the mountain in one of the basic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">inns</ENAMEX>, such as those at the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Shrine of Limpid Waters</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jinshui</ENAMEX>), before being driven to the summit before dawn to see the famous sunrise.
At sunrise on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golden Peak</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jinding</ENAMEX>) pilgrims and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vacationers</ENAMEX> alike gather in hopes of seeing an optical phenomenon called <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚ÄúBuddha‚Äôs Halo</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚Äù Here</ENAMEX>, each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewer</ENAMEX> can see his or her shadow perfectly framed inside a bright halo formed when the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> sea of clouds below <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Suicide Precipice</ENAMEX> is penetrated by the rising sun. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Luoyang</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Loyang</ENAMEX>)
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Luoyang</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> stands at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly a million</NUMEX>, almost the same as it was during the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sui Dynasty</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1,400 years ago</TIMEX>, when it shared the imperial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chang‚Äôan</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">present-day</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Xi‚Äôan</ENAMEX>). Those were <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the days</TIMEX> of imperial splendor and glory. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Luoyang</ENAMEX> is sometimes known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Capital for Nine Dynasties</ENAMEX>, reflecting a political and cultural prominence that originated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly 4,000</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX>.
In the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tenth</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">century</TIMEX> the imperial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> moved from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Luoyang</ENAMEX> to the northeast. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Luoyang</ENAMEX> later became capital of the central <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Henan</ENAMEX>, but by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 20th century</TIMEX> it was merely a shadow of its former self. After the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Communists</ENAMEX> took power, they decided to revive the small, sleepy <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> as a model industrial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">center</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Hundreds</NUMEX> of new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factories</ENAMEX> were built, turning out <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">tractors</ENAMEX>, mining equipment, ball bearings, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of other products.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Luoyang Museum</ENAMEX>, housed in a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Ming Dynasty temple</ENAMEX>, contains the fossil of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">elephant</ENAMEX> tusk half-a-million <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years old</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stone Age</ENAMEX> pottery, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shang</ENAMEX> bronzes, and glazed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tang</ENAMEX> ceramic figures. The nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Wangcheng Park</ENAMEX>, with its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Han Dynasty</ENAMEX> tombs, is a delight during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late April peony season</TIMEX>. But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Luoyang‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most precious relics are to be found outside of town.
A short distance east of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Luoyang</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White Horse Temple</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baimasi</ENAMEX>), which dates from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first century</TIMEX> a.d. It is often cited as the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monastery</ENAMEX> built in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>. The name refers to the story of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">envoys</ENAMEX> returning from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> monks they met along the way. The monks transported the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX> scriptures to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> on the backs of white <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Longmen Caves</ENAMEX>
Counted among the most precious of the grotto <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Longmen Caves</ENAMEX> lie <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 14 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">9 miles</NUMEX>) south of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Luoyang</ENAMEX>. The name <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Longmen</ENAMEX>, which means <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">‚ÄúDragon‚Äôs Gate</ENAMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äù</ENAMEX> might derive from the lie of the land here: cliffs standing like gate towers rise on either side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">River Yi</ENAMEX>. The best time to visit is <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early morning</TIMEX>, when the rising sun lights up the contours of the statues, giving them an eerie, lifelike quality.
The hard rock here was conducive to delicate carving, carried out on a monumental scale for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about 400 years</TIMEX> starting in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a.d. 494</TIMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">More than 1,300</NUMEX> grottoes were constructed, as well as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,100</NUMEX> niches and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly 100,000</NUMEX> statues. These range from a height of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 17 m</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">56</NUMEX> ft) to a fingernail-sized <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> cm (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">less than an inch</NUMEX>). In addition, there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> pagodas and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 3,600</NUMEX> inscribed steles or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tablets</ENAMEX>, of keen interest to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">historians</ENAMEX> and calligraphers. Some priceless sculpture was in the past looted by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Europeans</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guides</ENAMEX> often point out <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wall</ENAMEX> from which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> classic reliefs were chiseled in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1935</TIMEX> ‚Äúby a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">curio</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealer</ENAMEX> bribed by an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX>.‚Äù The works ended up in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kansas City</ENAMEX>.
Some of the earliest constructions were the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Binyang Grottoes</ENAMEX>, dedicated to an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emperor</ENAMEX> and empress of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern Wei Dynasty</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">386‚Äì534</ENAMEX>), after the capital was transferred to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Luoyang</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principal</ENAMEX> sculpture, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> times life-size, displays features typical of that dynasty‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX> art: a thin face, large eyes, straight nose, and quiet smile. An inscription reports that these works required the labor of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">802,366</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">craftsmen</ENAMEX>.
The subtleties of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tang-Dynasty</ENAMEX> art can be seen in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qianqi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cave temple</ENAMEX>, begun in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year 641</TIMEX>, and in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fengxian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cave temple</ENAMEX>, constructed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few years later</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Fengxian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cave shelters</ENAMEX> a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">17-m</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">56</NUMEX>-ft) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buddha</ENAMEX>, seated atop <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a thousand</NUMEX>-petaled lotus and accompanied by lesser but equally brilliant statues of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">disciples</ENAMEX>. The fierce, heavenly guard trampling a devil underfoot is thought to bring good luck to those who put their <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX> around his ankle, but an iron fence keeps most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">onlookers</ENAMEX> at bay.
Probably the oldest and one of the most beautiful of the grottoes is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guyang</ENAMEX>, begun in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">495</TIMEX> and completed under the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Northern Qi</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">575</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buddha</ENAMEX> depicted here is guarded by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">magnificent lions</ENAMEX> at his feet, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buddha‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qing Dynasty</ENAMEX> replacement for the original. A great curiosity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>, not at all sculptural, is the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Grotto of Prescriptions</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yaofangdong</ENAMEX>), begun in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year 575</TIMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">120</NUMEX> inscriptions here amount to a compendium of ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> illnesses and treatments.
The showstoppers at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Longmen</ENAMEX>, carved in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years 680 and 675</TIMEX>, respectively, are the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Cave of Ten Thousand Buddhas</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wanfodong</ENAMEX>), with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15,000</NUMEX> little <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Buddhas</ENAMEX> carved into its niches, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Honoring Ancestors Cave</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Juxianshiku</ENAMEX>), constructed at the behest of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tang Empress Wu</ENAMEX>. It is the largest cave at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Longmen</ENAMEX> and the large <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buddha</ENAMEX> inside it is said to bear the face of the never-humble <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Empress Wu</ENAMEX> herself.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nanjing</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nanking</ENAMEX>)
This ancient capital of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> has suffered so many catastrophes that few historic monuments have survived¬†‚Äî¬†and these are widely dispersed. Perhaps this is why so much emphasis is placed on modern triumphs, such as the heroic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX> across the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Yangzi River</ENAMEX> that has become <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nanjing‚</ENAMEX>Äôs emblem. But past and present are often juxtaposed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nanjing</ENAMEX>, like the blue pedicabs sharing the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> with big new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">buses</ENAMEX>, or the fresh pink-and-white plum blossoms on the hillsides around the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mingxiaoling</ENAMEX> tomb.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nanjing</ENAMEX>, a booming <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">over 5 million</NUMEX>, is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 300 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">185 miles</NUMEX>) west of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shanghai</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jiangsu</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kiangsu</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Province</ENAMEX>. Here the great <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Yangzi River</ENAMEX> narrows to slightly more than <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">one kilometer</NUMEX>, so even before there was a bridge the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> had held high strategic significance. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Visitors</ENAMEX> are usually advised to avoid <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nanjing</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August</TIMEX>, when the heat can become debilitating; temperatures of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40¬∞C</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">104¬∞F</NUMEX>) are no rarity.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nanjing means ‚ÄúSouthern Capital</ENAMEX>,‚Äù a name conferred rather late in the city‚Äôs history. During its early grandeur under the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">State of Chu</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> was called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚ÄúJinling</ENAMEX>,‚Äù a name still used in literary and other allusions. Then in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the third century</TIMEX>, in the era of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Three Kingdoms</ENAMEX>, it was christened ‚ÄúJianye.‚Äù Under that or similar titles it served as the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> southern dynasties. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ming</ENAMEX> emperors made it the national capital, but this was soon moved north to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 15th century</TIMEX>.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 20th century</TIMEX> a series of dramas overtook <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nanjing</ENAMEX> and gave it new prominence. It was here that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sun Yat-sen</ENAMEX> was elected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">republic</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chiang Kai-shek</ENAMEX> made it his <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> until the advance of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> invasion forces induced him to head west. When the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> finally arrived here in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1937</TIMEX>, the ‚ÄúRape of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nanking‚Äù</ENAMEX> was added to the catalogue of war‚Äôs atrocities. A monument (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Datusha Jinianguan</ENAMEX>) just outside the old city <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wall</ENAMEX> commemorates the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">around 100,000</NUMEX> died in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four days</TIMEX> alone. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Nationalists</ENAMEX> regained the battered <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> after the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> surrender in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1945</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Communist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX> crossed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yangzi</ENAMEX> (which the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> call <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Changjiang</ENAMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>ÄúLong <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">River‚Äù</ENAMEX>) in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 1949</TIMEX>, bringing the new order to the old capital.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Yangzi River Bridge</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nanjing Changjiang Daqiao</ENAMEX>) is an extraordinary engineering achievement. Only a few <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridges span</ENAMEX> the entire river, and this is the longest: at <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,577 m over</NUMEX> water, it is a little less than a mile. Proudly claimed to be the world‚Äôs longest two-tier <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX> for rail and road traffic, it has greatly improved contacts between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North and South China</ENAMEX>. And it inspired national self-confidence at the time of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sino</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> schism of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1960</TIMEX>. When the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> withdrew its technical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> built it themselves, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eight years</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nanjing</ENAMEX> claims a little-known distinction¬†‚Äî¬†the longest city <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wall</ENAMEX> in the world. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 14th century</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Ming</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rulers</ENAMEX> mobilized <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> to build fortifications extending <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">331‚ÅÑ2 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">nearly 21 miles</NUMEX>). The largest of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> city gates, newly renovated as a tourist attraction, is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zhonghuamen</ENAMEX>, on the southern edge of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nanjing</ENAMEX>. It was a formidable redoubt, with <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tunnels</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,000</NUMEX> besieged <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defenders</ENAMEX>, and was never taken by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enemies</ENAMEX>.
Also in southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nanjing</ENAMEX>, you can see the ruins of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Palace of the Heavenly King</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tianqangfu</ENAMEX>), built when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taiping Rebellion</ENAMEX> captured the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41</NUMEX>). It was the most ambitious architectural project of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-19th century</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Western Garden</ENAMEX> is full of fine touches: an imaginative rock garden, a dragon wall, a children‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">maze</ENAMEX>, and a bottle-shaped lake for an imperial stone <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houseboat</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nanjing Museum</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nanjing Bowuguan</ENAMEX>), founded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1933</TIMEX>, is located inside <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Zhongshan Gate</ENAMEX>, the main eastern portal of the city <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wall</ENAMEX>. Among art and artifacts from prehistoric times to the end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> displays colorful ancient pottery, elegant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">figurines</ENAMEX>, and a famous <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">jade</ENAMEX> burial suit <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2,000 years old</TIMEX>. 
Back in town, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Ming Dynasty Drum Tower</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gulou</ENAMEX>) has been restored to its eminence on a hill in the very center of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nanjing</ENAMEX>. The drum (since replaced) told the time and warned the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> of danger. Now there‚Äôs a tearoom <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">upstairs</ENAMEX> and a viewing deck. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the city‚Äôs liveliest temples is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fuzimiao</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Confucian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> located in the heart of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nanjing‚</ENAMEX>Äôs main shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">district</ENAMEX>; it is especially interesting to stroll through after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">working hours</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nanjing‚Äôs</ENAMEX> distinguished history as a political and cultural <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> accounts for its considerable local pride. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> area in which rivalry is freely revealed is the realm of cooking. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nanjing</ENAMEX> claims its salted <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">duck</ENAMEX> is superior to the more famous <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Peking duck</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Nanjing ducks</ENAMEX>, it‚Äôs pointed out, are raised naturally on ponds, not force-fed like their less fortunate <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">comrades</ENAMEX>.
Around <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nanjing</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilgrims</ENAMEX> of all political persuasions come from many <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> to honor the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Republic</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mausoleum</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sun Yat-sen</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zhongshanling</ENAMEX>), in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Purple Hills</ENAMEX> east of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nanjing</ENAMEX>. The hillside complex roofed with blue tiles, completed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1929</TIMEX>, could scarcely be more grandiose. Following a long winding avenue planted with plane <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>, you continue up the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">392</NUMEX> granite steps of the ceremonial staircase to the actual memorial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX>. There are statues of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sun</ENAMEX> standing, sitting (by a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> sculptor, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Landowski</ENAMEX>), and recumbent above the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">vault</ENAMEX> itself. On the ceiling is a mosaic version of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Nationalist</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guomindang</ENAMEX>) flag, a white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">star</ENAMEX> on a blue background. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sun</ENAMEX> often roamed these hills during his <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nanjing</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>. It was his own wish that he be buried here, although he could never have anticipated the imperial splendor that developed.
Nearby in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Purple Hills</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mingxiaoling</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tomb</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Emperor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hong Wu</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Ming Dynasty</ENAMEX>. What with wars and revolutions, there is not much left of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 14th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>. But don‚Äôt miss the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sacred Way</ENAMEX>, lined with large stone statues of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">elephants</ENAMEX>, camels, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">lions</ENAMEX>, and mythical <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, which turns north into an approach road guarded by statues of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generals</ENAMEX> and mandarins. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX> above the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">burial site</ENAMEX> are displayed pictures of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emperor</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guides</ENAMEX> report he was even uglier in real life; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> court <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> are said to have lost their heads for an excess of realism in their portraits.
Despite its long history, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nanjing</ENAMEX> is most remembered <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> for its role in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20th-century</TIMEX> events. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Yangzi Bridge</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sun Yat-Sen Memorial</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">‚ÄúRape of Nanjing‚</ENAMEX>Äù epitomize for many the essence of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nanjing</ENAMEX>. So, too, perhaps does <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meiling Palace</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meilinggong</ENAMEX>), the vacation <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chiang Kai-shek</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Song Meiling</ENAMEX>, now open as a period <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> for those nostalgic for the pre-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Revolutionary</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> between the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Last Emperor of the Manchus</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Communist Party</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qingdao</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tsingtao</ENAMEX>)
Imagine <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Copacabana</ENAMEX> beach set down on the shore of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Yellow Sea</ENAMEX>, mix in some century-old <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> villas and castles, and paint in pinewoods, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX>, and treelined hills for background. This world-class resort setting is one of the surprises of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qingdao</ENAMEX>, an important seaport situated on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shandong</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shantung</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Peninsula</ENAMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Six</NUMEX> beaches make this charming city one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China‚</ENAMEX>Äôs favorite summer retreats. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">sea</ENAMEX> is refreshing and so, usually, is the air, cooled in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> by the northerly ocean currents. Whether or not you decide to join the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">masses</ENAMEX> and take the plunge, you‚Äôll appreciate the chance to see them at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ease¬†‚Äî¬†sunbathing</ENAMEX>, strolling, having their pictures taken, and eating <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice cream</ENAMEX> or dumplings.
As you might deduce from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> architecture of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">railway station</ENAMEX> and many other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> here, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qingdao</ENAMEX> has an unusual history. Until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the 19th century</TIMEX>, there was little here apart from fishermen‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> and a minor <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> naval <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base</ENAMEX>. When <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> entered the imperialist age under <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kaiser Wilhelm</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qingdao</ENAMEX> was selected as a likely <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX> for development. A <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">99-year</TIMEX> lease was imposed on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Manchu</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>.
Soon a modern, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX>-style <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> was built, with villas, a deepwater <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX>, a cathedral, and a main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kaiser Wilhelmstrasse</ENAMEX>. Business was not everything: the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Germans</ENAMEX> used <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qingdao</ENAMEX> as a missionary base, too. It remains one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China‚</ENAMEX>Äôs more <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>. The twin-spired <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catholic cathedral</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tianzhu Jiaotong</ENAMEX>) and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Protestant</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jidu Jiaotong</ENAMEX>), with its working clock <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX>, tend to be crowded with local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sundays</TIMEX> and have become tourist attractions.
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qingdao</ENAMEX> suffered a curious fate during <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">I. Japan</ENAMEX>, which joined the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Allied</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">forces</ENAMEX>, invaded the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, imprisoned the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">survivors</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garrison</ENAMEX>, and occupied <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qingdao</ENAMEX> for the duration of the war. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> wasn‚Äôt able to regain sovereignty until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1922</TIMEX>. After the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Communists</ENAMEX> came to power in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1949</TIMEX>, industrial development went forward. However, even though the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> now exceeds <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4 million</NUMEX> (including the outlying regions), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qingdao</ENAMEX> keeps its quiet allure.
As permanent as any of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> contributions to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qingdao</ENAMEX> is its brewing prowess. The local <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beer</ENAMEX> has become <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China‚Äôs</ENAMEX> national <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beer</ENAMEX>, exported worldwide in big green bottles or modern cans under the old spelling of the town‚Äôs name, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚ÄúTsingtao</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äù Brewery</ENAMEX> tours can be arranged, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Qingdao International Beer Festival</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-August</TIMEX> has become <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China‚Äôs</ENAMEX> first attempt at an <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚ÄúOktoberfest</ENAMEX>.‚Äù
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qingdao</ENAMEX> is a remarkably walkable <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. Most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> architecture is concentrated in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Badaguan District</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiping Bay</ENAMEX>, near <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Beach No. 1</ENAMEX>. This is a lovely neighborhood of Western <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansions</ENAMEX>, landscaped <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">lawns</ENAMEX>, and tree-lined <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX>, capped by what can only be described as a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> by the sea¬†‚Äî¬†actually the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> governor‚Äôs lodge during colonial <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>.
Not far from the old villas and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Qianhai Pier</ENAMEX>, once the main berth for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX>. Now the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pier</ENAMEX> has been lengthened to an impressive <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">440 m</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">nearly a quarter of a mile</NUMEX>), and an octagonal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pavilion</ENAMEX> lies at the far end. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Visitors</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendors</ENAMEX> alike crowd the promenade. Roving portrait <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">photographers hustle vacationers</ENAMEX>, pitching the lighthouse as a background.
Above the beaches, with fine views of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> and the sea, are a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX> atop steep green hills. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Xinhao Park</ENAMEX> there stands the opulent <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX> built for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1903</TIMEX>. Now a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qingdao Welcome Guest House</ENAMEX> is also partly a period <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>. The grand piano in its plush <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lobby</ENAMEX>, dated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1876</TIMEX>, is <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX>. But the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">suites</ENAMEX> off the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lobby</ENAMEX> are decidedly <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX>, occupied for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a month in 1957</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mao</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> and left <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> just as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mao</ENAMEX> left them <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades ago</TIMEX>, including his desk with its secret compartment. 
In addition to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qingdao‚</ENAMEX>Äôs stunning beaches, which attract <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">sunbathers</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every summer</TIMEX>, the area is renowned for the mountain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Laoshan</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">30 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">nearly 20 miles</NUMEX>) to the east. Bordering the sea, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Laoshan</ENAMEX> is a region rich in legends, waterfalls, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">springs</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Laoshan</ENAMEX> mineral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, of vaunted medicinal value, originates here and is sold throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>; it is also a key ingredient of the tasty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beer</ENAMEX>. Once the site of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">72</NUMEX> temples, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Laoshan</ENAMEX> still boasts an interesting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> at its foot on the sea, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Xiaqinggong</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Daoist</ENAMEX> retreat that dates back to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> b.c.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shanghai</ENAMEX>
You couldn‚Äôt confuse <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shanghai</ENAMEX> with any other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. It is bigger, more prosperous, and more dynamic than any other; its skyline boasts <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX>-style <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">towers</ENAMEX>; its shop windows and food stalls seize your attention. Through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 1990s</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shanghai</ENAMEX> was the world‚Äôs boomtown, rebuilding itself and growing at a rate far beyond that of any other major <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. 
Before war and revolution changed its face, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shanghai</ENAMEX> was dominated by foreign fortune-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hunters</ENAMEX>, social climbers, and a glittering array of sinners. Its very name became a verb in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚Äúto shanghai‚</ENAMEX>Äù meant to abduct by trickery or force. Nowadays it is regaining some of its old glamour, albeit without the criminal edge.
With <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> (depending on how you count), <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shanghai</ENAMEX> is also one of the most expensive <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> in the world. A recent cost-of-living survey ranked <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shanghai</ENAMEX> as the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX> most expensive <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> in the world, ahead of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Geneva</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shanghai</ENAMEX> is not only expensive but extensive. The metropolitan area covers <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 6,000 sq km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">more than 2,300 sq miles</NUMEX>), which is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> times the size of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>. Administered as a separate region, like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shanghai</ENAMEX> metropolis includes rich farmland as well as big-city <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">housing complexes</ENAMEX> and heavy industry.
Shanghai‚Äôs present position as a great industrial and commercial center is part of an earlier <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20th century</TIMEX> colonial tradition. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> has retained a special appeal to visitors as a sophisticated, businesslike metropolis¬†‚Äî¬†made all the more colorful because of its nostalgic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shanghai</ENAMEX> in History
China‚Äôs prime <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX> began unpromisingly <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a thousand years ago</TIMEX> as a fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> on mud flats near the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yangzi River‚</ENAMEX>Äôs outlet to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East China Sea</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shanghai</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">didn‚</ENAMEX>Äôt officially become a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 13th century</TIMEX>, but even then it was largely ignored by the rest of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> and the world.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th and 18th centuries</TIMEX>, domestic commerce increased the importance of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> as a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX> and marketplace. But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> firmly resisted foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">connections</ENAMEX> until <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">gunboats</ENAMEX> won an invitation. After the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Opium War</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shanghai</ENAMEX> became one of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ports</ENAMEX> open to foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX> and trade. Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next few years</TIMEX> the influx of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Europeans</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">refugees</ENAMEX> from battles of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Taiping Rebellion</ENAMEX> turned <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shanghai</ENAMEX> into a glamorous, if naughty, trading <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port</ENAMEX>. But little of the prosperity filtered down to the ordinary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizen</ENAMEX>, who was kept apart. Bitterness at the injustices and corruption of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shanghai</ENAMEX> society fired the city‚Äôs revolutionary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">movement</ENAMEX>: the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Communist Party</ENAMEX> was founded here in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1921</TIMEX>.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Between 1937 and 1945</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shanghai</ENAMEX> was occupied by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">troops</ENAMEX>; most of the foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX> was interned. After the war the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Guomindang Nationalists</ENAMEX> took power, but <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Communist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> seized <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shanghai</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1949</TIMEX>. The new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX> wiped out organized crime and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice</ENAMEX>, expropriated <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factories</ENAMEX> and built new ones, setting the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> on a new industrial course. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1965</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Cultural Revolution</ENAMEX> was sparked off in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shanghai</ENAMEX>, as the political base of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jiangqing</ENAMEX>, the former <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shanghai</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actress</ENAMEX> who was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mao‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>. After the death of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mao</ENAMEX> and the arrest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Gang</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shanghai</ENAMEX> culture and art experienced a renaissance, and the new economic policies of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">1990s</NUMEX> benefited <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shanghai</ENAMEX> more than any other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. 
Sightseeing
As an essentially <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19th-century</TIMEX> phenomenon, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shanghai</ENAMEX> matured too late to contribute to classical <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> art or culture. If historic monuments are relatively rare here, it doesn‚Äôt mean the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> lacks for sights. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shanghai</ENAMEX> the interest shifts to relics of uninhibited prewar capitalism and scenes of the city‚Äôs contemporary energy and flair.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shanghai</ENAMEX> sums up the strange, and often uncomfortable, meeting of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West</ENAMEX>, of old and new. The muddy <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Huangpu River</ENAMEX> slices through the center of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, after passing through the seemingly interminable industrial suburbs complete with their fuming smokestacks. Foghorns converse into <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the night</TIMEX>, long after the sound of car horns and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bike</ENAMEX> bells has ceased. The river traffic is a motley flotilla of modern container <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX> and ocean-going junks¬†‚Äî¬†their sails the color of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">grime¬†‚Äî¬†of packed ferries</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">convoys</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">barges</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">warships</ENAMEX>, rusty coasters, and bobbing sampans. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Visitors</ENAMEX> can take a comfortable and endlessly fascinating riverboat tour of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Huangpu</ENAMEX> from downtown <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shanghai</ENAMEX> to the mouth of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Yangzi River</ENAMEX>.
Returning to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, in the almost inevitable haze, you see the astonishingly un-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> skyline of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shanghai</ENAMEX>, a mythical <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> metropolis transplanted to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Orient</ENAMEX>. The riverfront promenade on the left <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Huangpu</ENAMEX> used to be called the Bund (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Waitan</ENAMEX>), from an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglo</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> word for an embankment on a muddy shore. It‚Äôs easy to imagine the elegance of the Bund in its heyday, when the gardens were barred to <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX>, in that order. This is the place for relaxed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>-watching, from <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early morning</TIMEX> when the shadow-boxers work out until <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the evening</TIMEX> strolls of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">well-dressed</ENAMEX> courting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couples</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">promenade</ENAMEX> has been widened. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">There‚Äôs</ENAMEX> even a small port <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> in an old brick <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX>. 
Facing the river along <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Zhongshan Road</ENAMEX> are some grandiose old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>, a bit the worse for wear. These include the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peace Hotel</ENAMEX>; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seamen‚Äôs Club</ENAMEX>, formerly the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> consulate; and the massive <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">1923</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX> of the old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shanghai Bank</ENAMEX>, recently renovated and transformed into a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX>, with the separate entrances for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Europeans</ENAMEX> eliminated. And east across the river is new <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East Shanghai</ENAMEX>, known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pudong</ENAMEX>, where construction is booming and where you can enjoy a view from the top of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asia‚</ENAMEX>Äôs tallest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX>.
Around <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nanjing Road</ENAMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the pleasures of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shanghai</ENAMEX> is to stroll <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nanjing Road</ENAMEX>, long the most famous shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">avenue</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>, to see what‚Äôs new and what‚Äôs old. Ending up at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peace Hotel</ENAMEX> (now the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heping Hotel</ENAMEX>) on the Bund, don‚Äôt fail to visit the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Art-Deco</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lobby</ENAMEX>. This is where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noel Coward</ENAMEX> holed up to write <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Private Lives</ENAMEX> and where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven Spielberg</ENAMEX> filmed scenes for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Empire</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sun</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peace Hotel‚</ENAMEX>Äôs jazz <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">band</ENAMEX>, performing here since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1930s</TIMEX>, still swings every <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</TIMEX> in the north wing.
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">North</ENAMEX> from the Bund is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ohel Moshe Synagogue</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moxihuitang</ENAMEX>), built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1927</TIMEX> to serve <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shanghai‚Äôs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">resident</ENAMEX> and refugee <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, which once reached <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20,000</NUMEX>.
On the south side of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nanjing Road</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">People‚Äôs Park</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renmin Gongyuan</ENAMEX>), which used to feature a racecourse, but gambling is sternly condemned in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">People‚Äôs Republic</ENAMEX>. Now the only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">runners</ENAMEX> are the local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, who play among the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">park‚Äôs trees</ENAMEX>, ponds, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">lawns</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kite-fliers</ENAMEX>, who occupy the large <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">People‚Äôs Square</ENAMEX> in front of the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shanghai Museum</ENAMEX>. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Unequivocally</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shanghai Museum</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shanghai Bowuguan</ENAMEX>) is the best in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>, especially in terms of its state-of-the-art displays and presentation. There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floors</ENAMEX> of exhibits with <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stalls</ENAMEX> on each <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX> selling gifts and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> reproductions. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bronzes</ENAMEX> and stone sculptures are on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> floor, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ceramics</ENAMEX> are on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX>, paintings and calligraphy are on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX>, and coins, jade, and furniture are on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX>. Not all of the museum‚Äôs 120,000 artifacts can be displayed here at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time, but many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> savor these displays and insist upon a return visit. For a break during <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> browsing, there‚Äôs a lovely tearoom on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX>. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Old Town</ENAMEX>
Just southwest of the Bund is a district known <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚ÄúOld Town</ENAMEX>,‚Äù within the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">circle</ENAMEX> formed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renminlu</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zhonghualu</ENAMEX>. On <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fuyoulu</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Yuyuan Garden</ENAMEX> was commissioned by a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Ming Dynasty</ENAMEX> mandarin. As the main classical <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garden</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shanghai</ENAMEX>, it is an absolute gem of landscaping and architecture, the perfect place for the local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to seek tranquillity, so conveniently offered in the heart of old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shanghai</ENAMEX>. If you visit only one classic garden in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>, this is the best single choice. 
Just inside the main gate is a rockery, an artificial hill of inherently interesting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stones</ENAMEX>, held together with glutinous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice powder</ENAMEX> and lime. From the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pavilion</ENAMEX> atop this hill, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ming</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> could watch all the excitements of river life, though tall <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> now intervene. In front of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hall of Ten Thousand Flowers</ENAMEX> grows <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a 400-year-old</TIMEX> gingko <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>. Another carefully created rockery is reflected in a pond teeming with giant goldfish. All the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">corridors</ENAMEX> and pavilions, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridges</ENAMEX> and walls, sculptures and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> are so artfully arranged that the garden seems many times larger than its actual, compact size.
Outside the garden walls, a large rectangular pond is bisected by the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Nine Turnings Bridge</ENAMEX>, so shaped to deflect evil spirits. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX> is the only link to the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">400-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Huxinting Teahouse</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">257</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yuyuanlu</ENAMEX>), which lies in the center of an illuminated pond. With its upswept roofs, this is an irresistible stop for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">snacks</ENAMEX>. There‚Äôs no prettier teahouse in all of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>.
The teahouse pond marks one corner of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Old Chinese City</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nanshi</ENAMEX>), once deemed a danger zone for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>. You might still get lost in this maze of backstreets, reminiscent of a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">North African</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">souk</ENAMEX>, but much of it has been renovated, tastefully, into the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Yuyuan Shopping Center</ENAMEX>. There are still <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> from the old bazaar days selling chopsticks, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicines</ENAMEX>, bamboo <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fans</ENAMEX>, silk, and incense.
Also redeveloped nicely is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Town Gods</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chenghuangmiao</ENAMEX>), which dates back to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 15th century</TIMEX> and now hosts street fairs within sight of the teahouse and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Yuyuan Garden</ENAMEX>, as it did in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">previous centuries</TIMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">French Quarter</ENAMEX>
West of the riverside and old <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">section</ENAMEX> is a landmark of modern history: the low brick <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">76</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Xingyelu</ENAMEX>, where the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Communist Party</ENAMEX> was founded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 1921</TIMEX>. This was in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concession</ENAMEX>, and when the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">police</ENAMEX> learned of the clandestine meeting, they raided the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-story <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">corner house</ENAMEX>. But they arrived too late to find the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conspirators</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mao Zedong</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Communist</ENAMEX> founding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fathers</ENAMEX> continued their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">congress</ENAMEX> aboard a hired excursion <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> on a lake. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> with documents and displays.
Today, much of the finest <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> architecture in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shanghai</ENAMEX> is most visible in and around the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">French Quarter</ENAMEX>. Art-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Deco</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tudor</ENAMEX> villas, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">neo-Gothic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>, and large elegant <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansions</ENAMEX> line many of the small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>. The modern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Garden</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hotel</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">58</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maominglu</ENAMEX>) preserves the original lobby area of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cercle Sportif Fran√ßais</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1920s</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shanghai Arts and Crafts Research Institute</ENAMEX> is housed in a wonderful old <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansion</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">79</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fenyanglu</ENAMEX>) and allows <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> to view artisans at work on embroidery, paper cutting, and other crafts.
Nearby at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1555</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Huaihaizhinglu</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Shanghai Library</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shanghai Tushuguan</ENAMEX>), one of the world‚Äôs largest with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 13 million</NUMEX> volumes, has rare books dating back <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1,400 years</TIMEX> and a reading <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> for foreign-language books. 
Other old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> open to view include <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Soong Ching-ling‚Äôs</ENAMEX> Former <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Residence</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Songqingling Guju</ENAMEX>), where the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sun Yat-sen</ENAMEX> lived until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1963</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sun Yat-sen‚Äôs</ENAMEX> Former <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Residence</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sunzhongshan Guju</ENAMEX>), where the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Republic</ENAMEX> lived until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1924</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Xujiahui Cathedral</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gothic</ENAMEX> church erected in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1848</TIMEX>, now holds <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">masses</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Chinese</ENAMEX>. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚ÄùNew‚Äù Shanghai</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pudong</ENAMEX>
Immediately across the river from the Bund and old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shanghai</ENAMEX> is the future¬<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">†‚Äî¬†the Pudong New Development Zone</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shanghai</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 300</NUMEX> skyscrapers, and most of them are in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pudong</ENAMEX>, in the new <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East Shanghai</ENAMEX>. With its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">88</NUMEX> stories, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China‚</ENAMEX>Äôs tallest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> is here: the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">427-m</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,400</NUMEX>-ft) <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Jinmao Plaza</ENAMEX>. So is an even bolder monument, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pearl of the Orient TV Tower</ENAMEX>, presently <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asia‚</ENAMEX>Äôs tallest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">468 m</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,535 ft</NUMEX>) and a symbol of the mighty new <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>. The observation deck atop the TV <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> is one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shanghai‚</ENAMEX>Äôs top tourist draws. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pudong</ENAMEX> even has its own burgeoning version of the Bund. And although it lacks history, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Binjiang Road</ENAMEX> has modern <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, caf√©s, and performing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troupes</ENAMEX>, making the east <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX> an up-and-coming rival to the west <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Outlying Sights</ENAMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jade Buddha Temple</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yufosi</ENAMEX>), in northwest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shanghai</ENAMEX>, is not old, but it is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shanghai‚</ENAMEX>Äôs leading <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX> site and quite active with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">resident</ENAMEX> monks. Its <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Song Dynasty</ENAMEX>-style grounds house a priceless white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">jade</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buddha</ENAMEX> statue in the seated position of enlightenment, brought from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Burma</ENAMEX>. Most statues in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX> temples are molded of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">clay</ENAMEX> with a thin overlay of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX>, so these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">giant</ENAMEX> jade works attract curiosity <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">seekers</ENAMEX> as well as worshippers. Around the back of the altar is a flamboyant three-dimensional mural. As an extra attraction for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX>, there‚Äôs an antiques shop in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">compound</ENAMEX> with some unusual items at interesting prices.
Shanghai‚Äôs only ancient pagoda, part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Longhua Temple</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Longhuagusi</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> in the southwest suburbs, was rebuilt <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than a thousand years ago</TIMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX>-level octagonal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> was restored in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1950s</TIMEX>. But no one tried to correct its appealing tilt, insignificant when compared to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Tower of Pisa</ENAMEX> but notable nonetheless. Tiny bells, suspended from the corners of the upswept eaves, tinkle in the breeze.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shanghai Entertainment</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cuisine</ENAMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> popular venues for the performing arts are the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shanghai Center Theatre</ENAMEX> and the new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Grand Theatre</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dajuyuan</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shanghai‚</ENAMEX>Äôs answer to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sydney Opera House</ENAMEX>. 
Finally, there‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shanghai</ENAMEX> cuisine. While popular local dishes are based on beancurd, together with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mushrooms</ENAMEX> and bamboo shoots, the best-known <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shanghai</ENAMEX> recipes capitalize on the city‚Äôs proximity to the sea. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Steamed freshwater crabs</ENAMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX> through to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December</TIMEX>, and river eel are the highlights for many gourmets.
Shaolin
The fighting monks in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a thousand</NUMEX> kung fu films can trace their origin to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shaolin Monastery</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Henan Province</ENAMEX>. In fact, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> martial arts and such offshoots as the gentler exercise forms known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taiqi</ENAMEX> have their symbolic, if not literal, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">birthplace</ENAMEX> at this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monastery</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buddhism</ENAMEX> known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chan (‚ÄúZen‚Äù</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> and the West) also looks to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shaolin</ENAMEX> as its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX>.
With so many traditional arts centered at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> historic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">site</ENAMEX>, it‚Äôs no wonder the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shaolin Monastery</ENAMEX> has become one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China‚</ENAMEX>Äôs more popular tourist attractions. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shaolin</ENAMEX> now provides movie sets for film <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crews</ENAMEX> as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> for domestic and foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX> in self-defense. As an excursion, it is close to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Zhengzhou</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">80 km/50 miles</NUMEX> to the east) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Luoyang</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">70 km/43 miles</NUMEX> west).
You don‚Äôt have to be a kung fu practitioner to enjoy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shaolin</ENAMEX>. While crowded and commercialized, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shaolin</ENAMEX> is still one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most interesting historical and religious monuments, dating back to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the fifth century</TIMEX> a.d. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">625</TIMEX> it was expanded by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tang Dynasty</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emperor</ENAMEX> in gratitude for wartime services rendered by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shaolin</ENAMEX> monks, who used their fighting skills to send off some usurpers. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early sixth century</TIMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">monk</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Da Mo</ENAMEX> arrived at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shaolin</ENAMEX>, where he founded <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chan Buddhism</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Da Mo</ENAMEX>, who was probably a legendary rather than actual figure, is also heralded as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX> of kung fu (wushu), a system of hand-to-hand combat that was later modified to produce the immensely popular form of exercise that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> practice every <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China¬†‚Äî¬†taiqi</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">tai chi</ENAMEX>), sometimes called <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúshadow boxing‚Äù</ENAMEX> in the West.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shaolin</ENAMEX> monks do seem to have been well-versed in self-defense over the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16th century</TIMEX> they were called upon to rid <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China‚Äôs</ENAMEX> coast of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pirates</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1928</TIMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">warlords</ENAMEX> carved up sections of the faltering <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chinese Republic</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> general laid siege to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monastery</ENAMEX> and set it ablaze.
Today, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shaolin</ENAMEX> has a number of interesting relics and remains. Of the many <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">halls</ENAMEX>, pavilions, and temples linked by broad courtyards, the most important is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thousand Buddha Hall</ENAMEX> (dating back to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1588</TIMEX>), with its fresco of monks engaging in battle. In the rear of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX> is a sacred stone <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX>, heavily dented, where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX> of leaping monks are said to have left the imprint of their training. Nearby is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shadow Stone</ENAMEX>, a slab with the outlines of a figure in meditation, said to be from the cave where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Da Mo</ENAMEX> meditated so steadfastly for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nine years</TIMEX> that he left his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shadow</ENAMEX> on the wall. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">A ten-minute</TIMEX> hike up the northern hill behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Shaolin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> leads to the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">cave</ENAMEX>, now a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrine</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">faithful</ENAMEX>.
The outer courtyards of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shaolin</ENAMEX> contain other unusual treasures. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Forest of Stupas</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shaolin Talin</ENAMEX>) is of historic note. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stupas</ENAMEX> (or dagobas) are small sealed pagodas that hold holy relics and remains of important monks. The forest of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">227</NUMEX> stupas at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shaolin</ENAMEX> covers over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1,000 years</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX> funerals, beginning with that of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tang Dynasty abbot</ENAMEX> who was buried here in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year 746</TIMEX>. Adjacent to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Forest of Stupas</ENAMEX> is the most popular display at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shaolin</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX> of open-air pavilions containing scores of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">wooden statuesÔøΩÔøΩ‚Äî¬†monks</ENAMEX> in all the classic poses of a feverish kung fu battle.
Shaolin offers <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">treat</ENAMEX> for the more adventurous. It is located at the foot of the western range of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Songshan mountains</ENAMEX>, part of the mountain cluster that was traditionally regarded as the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Central Mountain</ENAMEX> at the center of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX>. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">gondola</ENAMEX> now whisks <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> to the top, where hiking <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">trails</ENAMEX> are abundant and views of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Shaolin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> and the vast desert plains of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Henan</ENAMEX> are impressive. On the far side of the range, sheer walls of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stone 300 m</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,000 ft</NUMEX>) high tower over the plains, where a series of catwalks and carved footpaths wander through old temples and pavilions into the silence and emptiness beyond.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Suzhou</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Soochow</ENAMEX>)
For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Suzhou</ENAMEX> has been famous for its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canals</ENAMEX> and gardens, its beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, and the musical cadences of the local dialect. An old <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">proverb</ENAMEX>, referring to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">area‚Äôs linguistic charms</ENAMEX>, claims that even an argument in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Suzhou</ENAMEX> sounds sweeter than flattery in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Guangzhon</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marco Polo</ENAMEX> found the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhabitants</ENAMEX> better <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> than <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">warriors</ENAMEX>, and he described the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> as large and magnificent. So much silk was produced, he reported, that every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizen</ENAMEX> was clothed in it and the surplus was exported. Even <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, silk still retains its significance in the local economy.
Whether you go to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Suzhou</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shanghai</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nanjing</ENAMEX>, you will be moved by the wayside scenery, typical of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">China‚Äôs ‚Äúland</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù Sampans</ENAMEX> and scows ply the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canals</ENAMEX> that divide the farmlands, where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">barefoot peasants</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">straw coolie</ENAMEX> hats squelch through the muddy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">fields</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Grand Canal</ENAMEX> is crowded with strings of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">barges</ENAMEX> laden with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetables</ENAMEX>, construction materials, or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coal</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Suzhou</ENAMEX> in fact means ‚ÄúPlentiful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Water</ENAMEX>.‚Äù
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Grand Canal</ENAMEX>, second only to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Great Wall</ENAMEX> as a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> engineering achievement, was started <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2,400 years ago</TIMEX>. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the sixth century</TIMEX> it linked <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Suzhou</ENAMEX> and other rich farming areas of the south with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> of the north¬†‚Äî¬†most notably the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emperor</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX>, who appreciated receiving fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> regardless of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the season</TIMEX>. Canal excursions by tourist boat often begin in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Suzhou</ENAMEX>, continuing to another enchanted <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wuxi</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">173</NUMEX>).
But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Suzhou</ENAMEX> is best known for its perfectly landscaped, classical <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> gardens. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">More than 150</NUMEX> were laid out, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first over a thousand years ago</TIMEX>. Largest of all is the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Humble Administrator‚Äôs Garden</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zhuozhengyuan</ENAMEX>), built by a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Ming Dynasty</ENAMEX> mandarin not otherwise remembered for humility. As befits the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">City of Plentiful Water</ENAMEX>, ponds make up the better part of the terrain. And where there are ponds there are almost bound to be artificial islands, winding <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridges</ENAMEX>, gazebos, and weeping willows.
To the west, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lingering Garden</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Liuyuan</ENAMEX>) is a refuge of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>, courtyards, and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">halls</ENAMEX>. This one, too, was built by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ming</ENAMEX> civil <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">servant</ENAMEX> as a place for meditation. While you linger, contemplate the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">five-ton</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rock</ENAMEX> shipped here <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">400 years ago</TIMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lake Tai</ENAMEX> because of its inspiring shape. Nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Garden</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xiyuan</ENAMEX>) was given to a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monastery</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> was destroyed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Taiping Rebellion</ENAMEX>, then rebuilt. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Forest of Lions Garden</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shizilin</ENAMEX>) dates back to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1336</TIMEX>, its rocks from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lake Tai</ENAMEX> evoking the form and power of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">lions</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Qing Dynasty Emperors</ENAMEX> modeled the rockeries in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Old Summer Palace</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> after those they saw in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Suzhou‚Äôs Forest</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lions</ENAMEX>.
Probably the smallest of all the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Suzhou</ENAMEX> gardens, situated right in the center of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, is the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Garden</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Master of the Nets</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wangshiyuan</ENAMEX>), covering <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">half a hectare</NUMEX> (barely more than an acre). The garden‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX>, a retired <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politician</ENAMEX>, claimed he had given up public life to become a fisherman. Whatever his interests, he could hardly fail to be inspired by the view from his simple study. This <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gem</ENAMEX> is considered the masterpiece of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> classical garden design and served as the inspiration for the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Astor Chinese Garden Court</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">City‚Äôs Metropolitan Museum of Art</ENAMEX>. 
Among <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Suzhou‚Äôs</ENAMEX> tourist highlights, the highest is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tiger Hill</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Huqiu</ENAMEX>), a man-made hill built <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2,500 years ago</TIMEX>. It is rich in contrived rock formations, vegetation, and waterfalls. From the summit rises a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX>-level brick <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pagoda</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yunyanta</ENAMEX>). Like the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shanghai</ENAMEX>, it leans a bit from the vertical, although modern <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reinforcements</ENAMEX> should relieve your anxiety. Other sights worth lingering over in the old inner city include <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 14th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Panmen Gate</ENAMEX>, where a magnificent arched bridge crosses a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canal</ENAMEX> linking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Suzhou</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Grand Canal</ENAMEX>. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Suzhou</ENAMEX> is also famous for its silk production. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Suzhou Silk Museum</ENAMEX> exhibits the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5,000 years</TIMEX> of silk history in the region, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum of Suzhou Embroidery</ENAMEX> is a working <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factory</ENAMEX> and sales outlet featured on many <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> tours.
There is one religious site of special note, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple of Mystery</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xuanmiaoguan</ENAMEX>), in the heart of a modernizing downtown shopping area. It includes the largest early <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Daoist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> (built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1179</TIMEX>) and is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> surrounded by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Suzhou‚</ENAMEX>Äôs biggest and liveliest outdoor market.
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Taishan</ENAMEX>
Although not well known in the West, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taishan</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most celebrated peak. Everyone who was anyone in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> history, from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Confucius</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mao</ENAMEX>, has stood on its summit. Because it was long regarded as the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Sacred Mountain</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">followers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daoism, Taishan</ENAMEX> served as the supreme altar of worship for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">millions of pilgrims</NUMEX> for over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2,000 years</TIMEX>. It undoubtedly ranks as one of the most climbed mountains in the world. Even <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> it attracts large numbers of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>, most of them from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>.
Situated in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shandong Province</ENAMEX> on the rail line between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shanghai</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taishan</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only 1,545 m</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5,069 ft</NUMEX>) in elevation, but it is a steep climb as it rises for views of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East China Sea</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> there are over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> active temples on its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">slopes</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 800</NUMEX> carved <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tablets</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 1,000</NUMEX> cliff-face inscriptions. It is a library of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> culture that is carved into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> of nature.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tai‚Äôan</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taishan‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base</ENAMEX> that is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">64 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">40 miles</NUMEX>) south of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jinan</ENAMEX>, is home to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dai Temple</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daimiao</ENAMEX>), a walled <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> filled with its own historic treasures. These include a stone tablet recording the mountain‚Äôs promotion to the position of ‚ÄúEmperor of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>,‚Äù as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taishan</ENAMEX> was designated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1011</TIMEX> by a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Song Dynasty</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emperor</ENAMEX>. Rarest of all is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qin Tablet</ENAMEX>, carved in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">209 b.c.</TIMEX> to commemorate the ascent of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taishan</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China‚Äôs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">first emperor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qinshi Huangdi</ENAMEX>. The main <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> also contains a statue of the God of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mountain, Taishanwang</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dead</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North of the Dai Temple</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pilgrim‚Äôs Road</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Panlu</ENAMEX>) leads to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Gate</ENAMEX> of Heaven, the entrance to the mountain. Beyond this point it is mostly massive granite steps. From the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Gate</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Middle Gate</ENAMEX> of Heaven is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 5 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 miles</NUMEX>), and from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Middle Gate</ENAMEX> to the top <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">less than 3 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 miles</NUMEX>), but the final mile is the steepest, as the elevation rise is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,370 m</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4,500 ft</NUMEX>). Those in a hurry can catch a bus or hire a taxi to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Middle Gate</ENAMEX> and from there take the cable <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> to the top.
Those who keep to the old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pilgrim‚Äôs path</ENAMEX> are in for a long but fascinating walk. Among the celebrated sights are the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Valley</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stone Sutra</ENAMEX>, where <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixth-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Buddhists</ENAMEX> carved the text of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diamond Sutra</ENAMEX> into a smooth stream bed; the pine tree that sheltered the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emperor</ENAMEX> on his climb; and a final ladder of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,000</NUMEX> stone steps leading to the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Pavilion That Touches the Sky</ENAMEX>.
On the summit there are even more treasures. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Tang Dynasty Rock Inscriptions</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moyabei</ENAMEX>) were struck in large gold-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foil characters</ENAMEX> to record <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Emperor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Xuanzong‚</ENAMEX>Äôs imperial pilgrimage in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year 726</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stele Without Inscription</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wuzibei</ENAMEX>) is blank, thought to have been placed here by the First <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Emperor</ENAMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2,000 years earlier</TIMEX>; everyone who reaches it must touch it for good luck. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Purple Dawn</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bixiaci</ENAMEX>) is the most revered of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrines</ENAMEX> on the summit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taishan</ENAMEX>. Here presides the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jade Goddess</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> of the mountain god, who cures blindness and answers the prayers of the childless. And there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of earnest petitioners and pilgrims even <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> on the summit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taishan</ENAMEX>.
At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">dawn</TIMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> who spend <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the night</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">inns</ENAMEX> on the summit await the sunrise. It is precisely here that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Confucius</ENAMEX> observed that the world is small and that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mao</ENAMEX> proclaimed ‚Äúthe <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Red</ENAMEX>.‚Äù
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Turpan</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Turfan, Tulufan</ENAMEX>)
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sidewalks</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Turpan</ENAMEX> would turn to mud if it ever rained, but it almost never does. Here in the middle of the great desert in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Xinjiang</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sinkiang</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Autonomous Region</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 16</NUMEX> mm (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">just over half an inch</NUMEX>) of rain ever reaches the ground in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">an average year</TIMEX>. Most evaporates on the way down.
Because of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Turpan‚Äôs</ENAMEX> location in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tarim Basin¬†‚Äî¬†at 79 m</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">260 ft</ENAMEX>) below sea level, this is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>-deepest continental <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">basin</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">world¬†‚Äî¬†it‚Äôs startling</ENAMEX> to discover here a sizeable <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> are supplied with electricity and running <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> and shady <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> line the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>. It‚Äôs an amazing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">oasis</ENAMEX>, a bastion of civilization in a climate as cruel as any on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Turpan‚Äôs</ENAMEX> secret is underground <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, utilized <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> as it has been for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> by a system of interconnecting <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wells</ENAMEX> (karez) that relay <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Heavenly Mountains</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tianshan</ENAMEX>) underground to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">oasis</ENAMEX>. (If the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">aqueduct</ENAMEX> were above ground, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> would almost all be lost through evaporation.) Over the whole region, these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tunnels</ENAMEX>, all dug by hand, stretch for perhaps <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3,000 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">more than 1,800 miles</NUMEX>), with some singular water <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tunnels</ENAMEX> running <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">as far as 40 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">25 miles</NUMEX>). Thanks to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wells</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Turpan</ENAMEX> grows <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cotton</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">melons</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">grapes</ENAMEX> of great sweetness and renown. And the surrounding desert is kept at bay by bountifully irrigated stands of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">elm</ENAMEX>, poplar, and palm <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>. The karez is an engineering feat on par with that of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Grand Canal</ENAMEX>, and an exhibition <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">well</ENAMEX> site allows <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> to enter several of these hand-dug <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wells</ENAMEX> for a close-up view. 
The climatic conditions of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">China‚Äôs ‚Äúoven‚Äù</ENAMEX> are nevertheless hostile to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX>, when the temperature exceeds 40¬∞C (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">104¬∞F</NUMEX>) for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> at a time, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locals</ENAMEX> take refuge in cellars until <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the night</TIMEX> breeze comes up. In the springtime, when the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mercury</ENAMEX> is merely in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 30s</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">close to 90¬∞F</NUMEX>), the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> dress for a chill¬†‚Äî¬†the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> in their long underwear and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> in thick brown <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stockings</ENAMEX> and gaily colored headscarves.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Turpan</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 200 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">125 miles</NUMEX>) southeast of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Urumqi</ENAMEX>, the regional <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">It‚Äôs</ENAMEX> so dry and (except for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX>) hot in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">oasis</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> are advised to drink as much <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">juice</ENAMEX> as possible to forestall dehydration. Laundry on the line dries in a matter of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> rather than <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Two thousand years ago</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Silk Road</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> stopped in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Turpan</ENAMEX> to find water and rest. The bazaar of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> might give you the impression that little has changed. There are outdoor butcher <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, cobblers, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dentists</ENAMEX>, and a shooting gallery, plus <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">merchants</ENAMEX> selling medicinal herbs, embroidered skullcaps, and tobacco by the pocketful. Makeshift <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> dish up spicy kebabs and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bread</ENAMEX> called nang. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX>, mostly of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Uighur nationality¬†‚Äî¬†Uighurs</ENAMEX> make up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80 percent</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Turpan‚Äôs residents¬†‚Äî¬†give this Silk Road oasis a most un</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> atmosphere. Minarets outnumber pagodas. Just east of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Emin Minaret</ENAMEX>, a stunning <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">44-m</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">144-ft</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> of blue brick erected in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1778</TIMEX>. The attached white stone <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX> with its plain interior is the largest in the region.
The most remarkable sites in the area are the ruins of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> ancient desert <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capitals</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jiaohe</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6 miles</NUMEX>) west of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Turpan</ENAMEX>, was founded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the second century</TIMEX> b.c. and laid out in a grid. Destroyed at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the 14th century</TIMEX>, its sand and brick still preserve the haunting outlines of a great <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> that stretched for <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a mile</NUMEX>, with a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> and headless statues at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>.
Gaochang, a second ancient city <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">46 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">29 miles</NUMEX>) east of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Turpan</ENAMEX>, has an imposing city <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wall</ENAMEX> with a perimeter of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 miles</NUMEX>). Gaochang reached its prime during the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tang Dynasty</ENAMEX>, when it became a capital of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China‚Äôs western territories</ENAMEX>. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Islam</ENAMEX> overtook <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buddhism</ENAMEX> here in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 13th century</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gaochang</ENAMEX> was abandoned. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Visitors</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> usually hire a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Uighur</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">donkey cart</ENAMEX> for a tour of the earthen remains.
<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">A few miles</NUMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gaochang</ENAMEX> is the royal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Astana Cemetery</ENAMEX>, discovered by accident in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1972</TIMEX>. Its oldest grave dates from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">a.d. 273</ENAMEX>. Because of the almost total lack of moisture, the murals in the tombs have retained their original lively colors¬†‚Äî¬†and many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">corpses haven‚Äôt</ENAMEX> aged much either. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Visitors</ENAMEX> can enter several of the underground <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">burial chambers</ENAMEX>, including one where a couple buried together <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12 centuries ago</TIMEX> lie side by side, their hair and fingernails grown long in death.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northeast of Turpan</ENAMEX>, the road skirts the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Flaming Mountains (‚ÄúKizilatak‚Äù</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Uighur, ‚ÄúHuoyanshan‚Äù in Chinese</ENAMEX>). Facing south, the slopes attract and store the sun‚Äôs heat; temperatures have been recorded <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as high as 75¬∞C</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">167¬∞F</NUMEX>). On a sheer cliff in a gorge in these mountains, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bezeklik Thousand Buddha Caves</ENAMEX> are perched, with carvings and frescoes dating from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fifth century</TIMEX>. Unfortunately, these beautiful grottoes have been largely emptied by rival religious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> and by archaeological adventurers from the West. The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> painted walls and ceilings that remain have almost faded into the gray dust of the engulfing desert.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Urumqi</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wulumuqi</ENAMEX>)
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mongolian</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Urumqi</ENAMEX> means <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚ÄúFine Pasture</ENAMEX>.‚Äù In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Uighur</ENAMEX>, it‚Äôs spelled with umlauts: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">√úr√ºmqi.</ENAMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> make <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> syllables of it. However you read or write it, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Urumqi</ENAMEX> sounds remote and exotic. Remote it is¬†‚Äî¬†the most distant major <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> in the world from any ocean or saltwater sea. Exotic? In fact, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Urumqi</ENAMEX> has an exotic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of minority and nomadic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peoples</ENAMEX>, but it has been developed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Han Chinese</ENAMEX> into a modern industrial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. And the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> (mostly recent ‚Äúeconomic‚Äù <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">migrants</ENAMEX>) make up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">75 percent</NUMEX> of its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Urumqi</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region</ENAMEX>, which covers <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one-sixth</NUMEX> of the total area of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>. It borders <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tajikistan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kyrgyzstan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kazakhstan</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mongolia</ENAMEX> on the old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Silk Road</ENAMEX> route through <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Central Asia</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than half</NUMEX> the province‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> belongs to minority <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, led by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Uighurs</ENAMEX>. The greatest attractions lie well outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, in scenic highlands where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nomads</ENAMEX> still reign.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Urumqi</ENAMEX> is the most modern and most <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Silk Road</ENAMEX>. Downtown <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">avenues</ENAMEX> are tree-lined, there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozens</NUMEX> of mosques, and the street markets provide splashes of color. At the largest covered market, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Erdaoqiao Bazaar</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendors</ENAMEX> sell handmade goods from boots to carpets and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">herds</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sheep</ENAMEX> and donkey <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">carts</ENAMEX> ply the alleyways. The most irresistible items are edible: kebabs, homemade <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">noodles</ENAMEX>, and round flatbreads, cooked on the spot over coal fires.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xinjiang Museum</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Xinjiang Bowuguan</ENAMEX>), with explanatory cards in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Uighur</ENAMEX>, contains <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Silk Road</ENAMEX> coins, earrings, tiles, silks, and a handful of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mummies</ENAMEX>, embalmed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">as long ago as the 13th century</TIMEX> b.c. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum stores</ENAMEX> carry the main local products: <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Persian</ENAMEX>-style carpets, ornate skullcaps, deadly looking knives in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bronze scabbards</ENAMEX> (which many of the local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> carry), stringed instruments, and white jade.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> characteristics on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Urumqi River</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Red Hill</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hongshan)¬†‚Äî¬†topped</ENAMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 18th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Zhenglong Pagoda¬†‚Äî¬†and Hongshan Park</ENAMEX>, on the west <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX>, are favorite leisure and picnic grounds for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locals</ENAMEX>. 
In the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southern Mountains</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nanshan</ENAMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">74 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">46 miles</NUMEX>) south of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Urumqi</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Kazakhs</ENAMEX> move their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> on horseback and set up their yurts on the high pastures to graze their <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sheep</ENAMEX>. At the end of the road, near an alpine waterfall, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Kazakhs</ENAMEX>, who once rode with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genghis</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kublai Khan</ENAMEX> across these grasslands, open their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July</TIMEX> stage a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six-day summer</TIMEX> fair (nadam) with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horse</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">races</ENAMEX> and wrestling.
A more famous scenic spot is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Heavenly Lake</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tianchi</ENAMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">120 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">75 miles</NUMEX>) east of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Urumqi</ENAMEX>, one of the prettiest mountain lakes in the world. It is surrounded by yurts, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">grazing sheep</ENAMEX>, and snowy peaks, capped by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mt. Bogda</ENAMEX>, with an elevation of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5,444 m</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">17,864 ft</NUMEX>). In this alluring high-country <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shangri-La</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Kazakhs</ENAMEX> are happy to share their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX>, shelter, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX> with paying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guests</ENAMEX> who want to ride the lake rim or spend <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the night</TIMEX> in a yurt. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wuhan</ENAMEX>
A lively industrial and intellectual <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wuhan</ENAMEX> is nearly equidistant from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guangzhou</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shanghai</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chongqing</ENAMEX>. Its setting at the confluence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yangzi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Han</ENAMEX> rivers has made it an important traffic junction. Here, the wail of riverboat foghorns mingles with train whistles on the nation‚Äôs main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">north-south railway</ENAMEX>.
The story of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wuhan</ENAMEX> has always been anchored in the vital, muddy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yangzi</ENAMEX>. So wide and treacherous is the river that, before the construction of the great <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">concrete</ENAMEX>-and-steel <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wuhan</ENAMEX> (the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> to cross the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yangzi</ENAMEX>) in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1957</TIMEX>, all communications depended on the ferries, which were often hampered by fog or flood. Now the two-tiered <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Yangzi River Bridge</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Changjiang Daqiao</ENAMEX>) is proudly shown to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> as a triumph of the new <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>. So are the dikes, so tall they cut off the view of the river from the embankment. But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yangzi‚</ENAMEX>Äôs rages can‚Äôt always be contained. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1983</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wuhan</ENAMEX> was flooded in spite of monumental preparations for the worst, and the great floods of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX> (the worst in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">54 years</TIMEX>) again pushed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wuhan</ENAMEX> to the brink.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wuhan</ENAMEX> is actually a modern, composite name for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> historic, contiguous <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wuchang, Hankou</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hanyang</ENAMEX>. Wuchang, the oldest, is bountifully supplied with parklands. Hankou, on the opposite <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yangzi</ENAMEX>, was opened to foreign development in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th century</TIMEX> as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treaty Port</ENAMEX>; at high tide <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10,000-ton</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX> can reach <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hankou‚Äôs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">harbor</ENAMEX> from the sea, some <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,500 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,000 miles</NUMEX>) away. Hanyang, separated from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hankou</ENAMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Han River</ENAMEX> (requiring another, less heroic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX>), is more typically <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX>.
After the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Opium Wars</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hankou</ENAMEX> was carved up into <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> zones of influence. Along <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Zhongshan Avenue</ENAMEX>, near the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yangzi</ENAMEX> ferry <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terminals</ENAMEX>, some of the old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> style are left. The municipal office <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> on the embankment, administering a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> which has now grown well beyond <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4 million</NUMEX>, are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cast</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> mold.
But <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wuhan</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hubei</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hupeh</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Province</ENAMEX>, also has a significant revolutionary history. The rebellion of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 1911</TIMEX>, which was inspired by Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sun Yat-sen</ENAMEX>, began in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wuchang</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hankou</ENAMEX> suffered heavy damage in the fighting. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central Peasant Movement Institute</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Communist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activists</ENAMEX> were trained in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1920s</TIMEX>, was established in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wuchang</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mao Zedong</ENAMEX> taught here, and his legacy is strong at several tourist attractions, including a villa (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mao Zedong Bieshu</ENAMEX>) where he often vacationed and several displays at the provincial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hubei Provincial Museum</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hubeisheng Bowuguan</ENAMEX>) owes its excellence to the chance discovery in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1978</TIMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tomb</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marquis Yi</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">State of Zeng</ENAMEX>. Located <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">108 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">67 miles</NUMEX>) northwest of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wuhan</ENAMEX>, the grave yielded treasure enough to furnish several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">About 1,000</NUMEX> items¬†‚Äî¬†a mere <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 percent</NUMEX> of the total hoard¬<ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">†‚Äî¬†are</ENAMEX> now on display here. Yi, who lived during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fifth century</TIMEX> b.c., died at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the age of 25</TIMEX> and was greatly mourned. He was buried with his <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> female sacrifices, as well as tributes ranging from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bronze wine</ENAMEX> vessels to enough musical instruments for an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">orchestra</ENAMEX>. The finest musical exhibit in the collection is a set of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">65</NUMEX> intricately decorated bronze bells, now restored to their original resonance. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Visitors</ENAMEX> can hear a tape recording of the bells interpreting both <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Western</ENAMEX> music; they sound like a cross between a glockenspiel and a modern carillon.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> looks out on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East Lake</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dong Hu</ENAMEX>), vaunted as the largest lake in any municipal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>, with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">33 sq km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">nearly 13 sq miles</NUMEX>) of invitingly clear <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boating</ENAMEX>, swimming, and fishing are popular here. Of course, no <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> lake would be complete without its artificial islands, causeways, and pavilions, several of which serve as teahouses festooned with peach and plum blossoms, <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">orchids</ENAMEX> or osmanthus, depending on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the season</TIMEX>.
Hanyang‚Äôs main religious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">landmark</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gui Yuan Temple</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guiyuan Chansi</ENAMEX>), sprawls among pines and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">cypress</ENAMEX>. Built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th century</TIMEX>, it was the only one of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wuhan‚Äôs 20</ENAMEX> or more <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX> temples spared by rampaging <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Red Guards</ENAMEX> during the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Cultural Revolution</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1966‚Äì1976</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hall of Five Hundred Disciples</ENAMEX> is a fascinating <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">gallery</ENAMEX> of statues. Grinning, yawning, frowning, meditating, and leering, each one is different.
The Northern <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Song Dynasty Ancient Lute Terrace</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guqintai</ENAMEX>) commemorates a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2,500-year-old</TIMEX> legend of the deep friendship between a lute-playing mandarin and a music-loving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woodcutter</ENAMEX>. Amateur <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">musicians</ENAMEX> hold forth in the teahouse here, a favorite meeting place of local pensioners.
Across the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">11‚ÅÑ2-km</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1-mile</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Yangzi River Bridge</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wuchang</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yellow Crane Tower</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Huanghelou</ENAMEX>), based on another legend. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX> built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a.d. 223</TIMEX>, the wooden structure burned down and was reconstructed several times. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1981</TIMEX> the latest rebuilding project got under way <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 1 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1‚ÅÑ2 mile</NUMEX>) from the original site. The design and decor of the new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> are based on paintings from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yuan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ming</ENAMEX> dynasties and a model of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX> as it existed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qing Dynasty</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wuxi</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wuhsi</ENAMEX>)
This appealing town really does deserve a more poetic name. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wuxi</ENAMEX> means ‚Äúno more tin,‚Äù a reference to the depletion, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of thousand years ago</TIMEX>, of the local <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mines</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wuxi</ENAMEX> is an industrial and marketing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">center</ENAMEX> with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than one million</NUMEX> in the ‚Äúland of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX>,‚Äù a fertile semitropical region. It lies <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">128 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">80 miles</NUMEX>) northwest of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shanghai</ENAMEX>, close enough for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a day</TIMEX> trip by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Canals</ENAMEX> and rivers crisscross the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Grand Canal</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wuxi‚</ENAMEX>Äôs prime historic attraction, flows right through the center of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lake Tai</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wuxi‚</ENAMEX>Äôs prime scenic attraction.
Even a short boat ride through the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Grand Canal</ENAMEX> produces unforgettable sights and photos. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> line the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridges</ENAMEX> (each of a different design) to wave. Human-propelled ferryboats scurry out of the way as long trains of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">barges</ENAMEX>, their decks heaped up with onions, reeds, or bricks, labor past. The riverside <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dwellers</ENAMEX>, who live in quaint whitewashed <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>, wash their clothes in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canal</ENAMEX>. You might see a fisherman assigning his captive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cormorants</ENAMEX> to dive, their gullets collared to stop them from eating the catch.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Grand Canal</ENAMEX> project, begun <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2,400 years ago</TIMEX>, created an inland <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">waterway</ENAMEX> stretching <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,794 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,113 miles</NUMEX>) from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hangzhou</ENAMEX>. Canal excursions organized for foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> range from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a half-day</TIMEX> tour to a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven-day</TIMEX> cruise that takes in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Suzhou</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wuxi, Changzhou</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhenjiang</ENAMEX>, in addition to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Yangzi River</ENAMEX> port of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yangzhou</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourist authorities</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jiangsu Province</ENAMEX> also promote bicycle tours through the flat green countryside.
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lake Tai</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taihu</ENAMEX>), a vast freshwater expanse boasting <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">72</NUMEX> islets, is the most celebrated lake in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> legend. <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Turtle Head Island</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yuantouzhu</ENAMEX>) is actually a peninsula at the edge of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lake Tai</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">sanctuary</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridges</ENAMEX>, and lake-viewing pavilions that began as a garden in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1918</TIMEX>. But more than any specific <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">landfall</ENAMEX>, the lake is a spectacle on its own, with its fleet of fishing junks and roving sampans. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Visitors</ENAMEX> can easily take to the waters aboard the public ferries to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Three Hills Island</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sanshandao</ENAMEX>). Largely an amusement <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> in the middle of the lake, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Three Hills</ENAMEX> (known locally as <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚ÄúFairy Island‚Äù</ENAMEX>) contains a new <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">tiered</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> with the statue of an ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emperor</ENAMEX>, providing an enchanting view of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Lake Tai</ENAMEX> from the top. 
To underline the monumental <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lake Tai</ENAMEX> in legend and in nature, the world‚Äôs largest standing statue of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buddha</ENAMEX> was unveiled in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lingshan</ENAMEX> on the lake shore <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">18 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">11 miles</NUMEX>) west of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wuxi</ENAMEX>. Fashioned from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bronze plates</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lake Tai Buddha</ENAMEX> weighs <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">700 tons and stands 73 m</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">240 ft</ENAMEX>) tall.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wuxi</ENAMEX> is also home to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> classic gardens. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Li Garden</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Liyuan</ENAMEX>) is composed of arched <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridges</ENAMEX>, gaudy pavilions, open walkways, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> ponds, a miniature <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">pagoda</ENAMEX>, and a covered <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">walkway</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">89</NUMEX> view-framing windows. <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Jichang Garden</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jichangyuan</ENAMEX>), established in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1520</TIMEX>, is a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Suzhou</ENAMEX>-style private garden much admired by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Emperor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Qianlong</ENAMEX>, who constructed a similar garden in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Beijing‚Äôs Summer Palace</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1750</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Jichang Park</ENAMEX> is contained within <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Xihui Park</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Grand Canal</ENAMEX>, site of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX>-tiered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ming Dynasty Dragon Light Pagoda</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Longguang</ENAMEX>) and a spring tulip festival with <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> imported from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Holland</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> also contains <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Erquan Spring</ENAMEX>, source of the some of the world‚Äôs best <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> brewing, according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Classic of Tea</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chajing</ENAMEX>), written by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholar</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Luyu</ENAMEX>. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xiamen</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amoy</ENAMEX>)
China‚Äôs cleanest major <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> (according to an official poll) and one of its most charming, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xiamen</ENAMEX> is a port <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> located in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fujian Province</ENAMEX>, hardly a heartbeat from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> across the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East China Sea</ENAMEX>. A prosperous place owing to its close connections with overseas <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> (many of whom emigrated from the area), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xiamen</ENAMEX> has wisely spared much of its downtown and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">harbor</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bulldozers</ENAMEX> of progress.
From the busy harbor <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>, overlooked by the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">balconies</ENAMEX> of the venerable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lujiang Hotel</ENAMEX>, you can stroll into old-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town areas</ENAMEX> along <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Zhongshan Road</ENAMEX>, past <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozens</NUMEX> of antique shophouses and caf√©s. Or you can head south along <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Minzu Road</ENAMEX> and take in the life of the fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">warehouses</ENAMEX> on the quays.
If you walk long enough (or hail a taxi), you end up at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nanputuo Temple</ENAMEX>, nestled in the hillside on the east shore of the harbor. This <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> is in immaculate condition, its marble a gleaming white. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Locals</ENAMEX> are always on hand, burning incense and praying for good fortune. The rocky cliffs behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> make for fine hiking and picnicking.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> and past <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xiamen University</ENAMEX> (founded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1921</TIMEX> by a local who made good in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Singapore</ENAMEX>) is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Huli Mountain Cannon Platform</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1921</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Germans</ENAMEX> placed their <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">artillery</ENAMEX> here to defend the colonial port of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amoy</ENAMEX>, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Xiamen</ENAMEX> was known to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Westerners</ENAMEX>. From here, if you look across the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Formosa Strait</ENAMEX> on a sunny <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX>, you can make out the disputed islands of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mazu</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jinmen</ENAMEX>. Once known to Western <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚ÄúQuemoy‚Äù and ‚ÄúMatsu</ENAMEX>,‚Äù these islands figured in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kennedy</ENAMEX> presidential debates of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1960</TIMEX>. Today, the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äúcold war‚Äù</ENAMEX> between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX>, often waged with loudspeakers and leaflet bombardments across the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Formosa Strait</ENAMEX>, appears to be over, and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> islands have been opened to tourism by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xiamen‚Äôs</ENAMEX> chief pleasure for any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitor</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gulangyu</ENAMEX>, a small island in the harbor that was once the home to foreign colonials. Passenger ferries connect downtown <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Xiamen</ENAMEX> to the island. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gulangyu</ENAMEX> has banned automotive <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicles</ENAMEX> and is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pedestrians island¬</ENAMEX>†‚Äî¬†not even <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bicycles</ENAMEX> are allowed here. The terrain is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">hilly</NUMEX>, with twisting cobblestone <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> (forming a compact maze), but you‚Äôre always within sight of a shoreline. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> are full of villas and grand <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>. Beginning in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1842</TIMEX>, Western <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> allowed in after the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Opium Wars</ENAMEX> built <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Gulangyu</ENAMEX> into a virtual <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, with their own <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Embassy</ENAMEX> still stands on a hill above the ferry landing, and beyond it the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roman Catholic Church</ENAMEX>, completed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1882</TIMEX> and still in use. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sanyi Protestant Church</ENAMEX>, built by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1904</TIMEX>, is also active. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">These days</TIMEX>, the colonial villas are occupied by local <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX>. The ripe gardens give <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gulangyu</ENAMEX> a lazy, tropical atmosphere reminiscent of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macau</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Malacca</ENAMEX>.
A statue of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patron saint</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xiamen, Koxinga</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zheng Chenggong</ENAMEX>), stands on the tip of the island. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">warrior</ENAMEX> in flowing robes, he expelled the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th century</TIMEX>. Not far from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Koxinga‚</ENAMEX>Äôs heroic image are the guesthouse villas and sandy beaches where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locals</ENAMEX> relax and sometimes even take a dip. Above the beaches is the island‚Äôs most famous garden, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shuzhuang</ENAMEX>, built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1913</TIMEX> by a wealthy <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">merchant</ENAMEX> and admired for its pond and rock design (‚Äúa garden in the sea, a sea in the garden‚Äù).
Best views are from the towering <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sunlight Rock</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Riguangyan</ENAMEX>) in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yanping Park</ENAMEX>, the highest point on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gulangyu</ENAMEX> and well worth the climb. From here, you can see across the long harbor to downtown <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Xiamen</ENAMEX>. And of course you can see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gulangyu</ENAMEX> itself, a dense sea garden of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>, red-tiled villas, and tiny <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">seafood caf√</ENAMEX>©s, a bright <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">just 12,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX>. (By comparison, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xiamen</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 600,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> and is a rampaging metropolis.)
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xiamen Museum</ENAMEX>, housed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gulangyu‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most striking red-domed <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>, contains a sprinkling of odd exhibits on its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floors</ENAMEX>, including printing presses, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tang Dynasty</ENAMEX> porcelains, wooden <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">rifles</ENAMEX>, assorted gifts from sister <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> around the world, and photographs of the island‚Äôs dazzling colonial architecture.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Xi‚Äôan</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sian</ENAMEX>)
When ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Peking</ENAMEX> was just a remote trading post, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xi‚Äôan</ENAMEX> was the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Middle Kingdom</ENAMEX> and the largest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> in the world. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palaces</ENAMEX>, pavilions, and pagodas crowned the skyline. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Artists</ENAMEX> and poets (and, of course, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cooks</ENAMEX>) catered to the most demanding imperial tastes. And since this was the starting point of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Silk Road</ENAMEX>, the most adventurous of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreigners</ENAMEX> congregated here.
Having made history over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several thousand years</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> is more populous than ever (at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX>) and proud of its leafy new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">avenues</ENAMEX>, modern <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factories</ENAMEX>, and housing projects. But there‚Äôs no avoiding the past in this treasure trove of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> civilization. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Xi‚Äôan</ENAMEX> and its surrounding countryside preserve the glories of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eleven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dynasties</ENAMEX>, and it is as a storehouse of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China‚Äôs Qin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Han</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tang Dynasty</ENAMEX> treasures that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xi‚Äôan</ENAMEX> has reached the top ranks of international tourism.
On the way to any of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xi‚</ENAMEX>Äôan‚Äôs archaeological sites, you get a good look at the wind-whipped landscape of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wei River valley</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Militarily</ENAMEX> and economically strategic since prehistoric times, the area comprises fertile cotton and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wheat</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">fields</ENAMEX>, fallow plains, and bizarre terraces of loess dotted with caves that provide housing even to this day.
As the rapidly modernizing capital of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shaanxi Province</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xi‚</ENAMEX>Äôan can look back almost with detachment on its regal past. During the first <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhou Dynasty</ENAMEX> (which ended in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">770 b.c.</TIMEX>), several places in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Xi‚Äôan</ENAMEX> district served as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capitals</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the third century</TIMEX> b.c., the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qin</ENAMEX> settled just northwest of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xi‚Äôan</ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Xianyang</ENAMEX>. When the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Han</ENAMEX> took over, in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">206 b.c.</TIMEX>, a grandiose new capital called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Chang‚Äôan (‚ÄúEverlasting Peace‚Äù</ENAMEX>) rose just north of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xi‚Äôan.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Imperial</ENAMEX> splendor returned under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sui</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">a.d. 581‚Äì618</ENAMEX>) when a capital known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Daxing (‚ÄúGreat Prosperity‚Äù</ENAMEX>) was established on the site of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xi‚Äôan.</ENAMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tang</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emperors</ENAMEX> who followed greatly enlarged and beautified the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, again naming it <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chang‚Äôan.</ENAMEX>
The golden age of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xi‚Äôan</ENAMEX> (as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chang‚Äôan</ENAMEX>) ended <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than a thousand years ago</TIMEX>, when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tang</ENAMEX> succumbed to rebellion and anarchy. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> sank into provinciality, even though impressive new <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> walls and official <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> were constructed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 14th century</TIMEX>. These features of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ming</ENAMEX> era¬†‚Äî¬†almost modern by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xi‚</ENAMEX>Äôan <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">standards¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†are the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> to catch the eye.
Sightseeing within <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">City Walls</ENAMEX>
The rectangular <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Ming Dynasty city wall of Xi‚</ENAMEX>Äôan is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">141‚ÅÑ2 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">almost 9 miles</NUMEX>) around and so thick that two-way chariot traffic could travel the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roadway</ENAMEX> on top. Major renovations have restored the ramparts, guard <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">towers</ENAMEX>, and city <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">moat</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gardens</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX> complement these massive fortifications, the last major <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> walls standing intact in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>.
In the center of the walled <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> are several monuments from the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Ming Dynasty</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bell Tower</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zhonglou</ENAMEX>) is another of those lofty wooden <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> ingeniously constructed without the use of nails. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> tiers of elegant roofs rise from a solid brick <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pedestal</ENAMEX> at the center of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, forming one of the emblems of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xi‚Äôan.</ENAMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Drum Tower</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gulou</ENAMEX>), a similar <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> across a new public <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> and shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mall</ENAMEX>, dates from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1370</TIMEX> and is also open to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the most popular new tourist treats are the bell-striking and drum-beating ceremonies carried out <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> by ‚Äúwarriors‚Äù to the sound of re-creations of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tang Dynasty</ENAMEX> music. The drum is sounded in its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> times at sunrise; the bell is sounded in its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> times at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">sunset</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Religious Sites</ENAMEX>
Just around the corner and up a curving alleyway of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendors</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Great Mosque</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qingzhensi</ENAMEX>) traces its history to a.d. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">742</NUMEX>. The serene and spacious <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> consists of gardens, temples, and pavilions, largely in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> style. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">side galleries</ENAMEX> contain beautifully carved furniture and screens. The triple-eaved <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Introspection Tower</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shengxin</ENAMEX>) is a minaret from which many of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Xi‚Äôan‚Äôs</ENAMEX> sizeable <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minority</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">descendants of Silk Road</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">travelers</ENAMEX>, are called to prayer. The prayer hall holds <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 1,000</NUMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Xi‚Äôan‚Äôs</ENAMEX> once-glorious temples were devastated during the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Cultural Revolution</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1966‚Äì1976</ENAMEX>), but restorations have led to the reopening of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lama Temple</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guangrensi</ENAMEX>), founded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1705</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Woolongsi</ENAMEX>, an ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Zen Buddhist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dongyuemiao</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Daoist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> to the mountain god of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taishan</ENAMEX>; and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX> of the Eight <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Immortals</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baxianguan</ENAMEX>), which is the most active of the city‚Äôs religious <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrines</ENAMEX> at present and has an open-air market.
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Museums</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xi‚Äôan</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> fine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shaanxi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Provincial Museum</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shaanxi Shengbowuguan</ENAMEX>), occupying <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 14th-century</TIMEX> grounds of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Confucius</ENAMEX>, holds a rich <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX> of art works and rare artifacts: funerary figurines, traditional paintings, ancient household equipment, and huge bronzes masterfully cast <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,000</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX>. But the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> focus must be on the museum‚Äôs famous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Forest of Steles</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beilin</ENAMEX>). This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> of inscribed stone slabs, including a complete edition of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Confucian</ENAMEX> classics (carved in a.d. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">837</NUMEX>), documents the history of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> culture and calligraphy. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nestorian Stele</ENAMEX> records another history altogether, that of Christianity in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">635 to 781</TIMEX>. The art of calligraphy is exalted in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> as nowhere else. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> leading to the old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> along the southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> wall, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shuyuanmen</ENAMEX>, has been restored and offers a fine collection of traditional art and calligraphy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>. 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shaanxi History Museum</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shaanxi Lishibowuguan</ENAMEX>), south of the city <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wall</ENAMEX>, houses a thoroughly modern collection of prehistoric and imperial treasures that is comparable to those in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Shanghai¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†and far superior in terms of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Han</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Qin</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tang Dynasty</ENAMEX> holdings.
Pagodas
When the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Big Wild Goose Pagoda</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dayanta</ENAMEX>) was built in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">a.d. 652</ENAMEX> during the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tang Dynasty</ENAMEX>, it stood well within the walled <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xi‚Äôan</ENAMEX> has since shrunk in size, and now the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX>-tiered brick <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pagoda</ENAMEX> rises in the middle of farming <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> to the south of the urban area. Grass grows from the pagoda‚Äôs roofs. The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Big Wild Goose Pagoda</ENAMEX> was built to house precious <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX> texts brought back from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xi‚</ENAMEX>Äôan‚Äôs most celebrated pilgrim, an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intrepid scholar</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Xuanzang</ENAMEX>. Having survived <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> of sandstorms and blizzards, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">demons</ENAMEX> and dragons, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Xuanzang</ENAMEX> was feted on his return to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">645</TIMEX>. He spent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next two decades</TIMEX> translating his stack of holy books from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sanskrit</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX>.
Though it‚Äôs shorter, slimmer, and slightly newer than the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Big Wild Goose Pagoda, the Small Wild Goose Pagoda</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xiaoyanta</ENAMEX>), built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a.d. 707</TIMEX>, has more tiers: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> at the moment. When it was built, it had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> tiers, but the top came tumbling down in a <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Ming-</ENAMEX>era earthquake. Both these exquisite <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tang Dynasty</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">towers</ENAMEX> (the finest of their kind in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>) can be climbed, yielding interesting views of the walled <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> and beyond. 
Excursions from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xi‚</ENAMEX>Äôan
The oldest of the region‚Äôs archaeological wonders are found in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> erected on the very site where they were discovered. This is at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stone Age</ENAMEX> site of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Banpo</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6 miles</NUMEX>) east of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xi‚Äôan.</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Six thousand years ago</TIMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX>, evidently thriving, occupied this farmland, but traces of habitation came to light only in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1950s</TIMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workmen</ENAMEX> were digging the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">foundations</ENAMEX> for a new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factory</ENAMEX>.
You have to climb a flight of stairs to reach the covered excavation. From a series of walkways you look down on the outlines of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>, ovens, storage areas, and graves. You can follow the evolution of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dwellings</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> from round <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> to rectangular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> with slanting roofs, the prototypes for today‚Äôs typical <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">abode</ENAMEX>. Also on display in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Banpo Museum</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Banpo Bowuguan</ENAMEX>) are some of the objects found in the course of excavations: axes, fishhooks, and utilitarian pots, as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">artistically decorated ceramics</ENAMEX> and, most dramatically, the skeletons of these ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">villagers</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qin Dynasty Warriors</ENAMEX>
China‚Äôs greatest archaeological attraction, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">terra cotta warriors</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qin Dynasty Army</ENAMEX>, stand in battle formation <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 30 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">nearly 20 miles</NUMEX>) east of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xi‚</ENAMEX>Äôan in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Terra Cotta Warriors</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Horses</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qinshihuang Bingmayong Bowuguan</ENAMEX>). The life-sized (and slightly larger) infantrymen, archers, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX>, and their <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX> symbolically guard the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tomb</ENAMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Qin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emperor</ENAMEX>.
Well before his death in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">210 b.c.</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qinshihuangdi</ENAMEX> conscripted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds of thousands</NUMEX> of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> to construct a suitably impressive <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tomb</ENAMEX>. That <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tomb</ENAMEX>, beneath an artificial hill nearby, has yet to be excavated. But the novel idea of guarding it with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of pottery <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX> was revealed by accident in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1974</TIMEX>, when local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peasants</ENAMEX> digging a well created a world-wide sensation.
An arched structure resembling an aircraft <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hangar</ENAMEX> has since been built to protect the exposed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vault</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> from the weather. Walkways permit <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> a bird‚Äôs-eye survey of the site, revealing the deployment of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6,000</NUMEX> of them reassembled and back in their original ranks. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">warrior</ENAMEX> is an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX>, with his own headdress, moustache or beard, and unique expression. The eager, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">graceful horses</ENAMEX> also have distinctive traits. The small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX> entrance to <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Vault 1</ENAMEX> contains <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">warriors</ENAMEX>, their steeds, and one of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> half-life-sized solid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bronze chariots</ENAMEX> found near the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Emperor‚Äôs</ENAMEX> burial mound.
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Vault 2</ENAMEX>, opened in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX>, is an excavation in progress. It contains the imperial cavalry: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">900</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">116</NUMEX> saddled <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">356</NUMEX> horses hitched to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">89</NUMEX> chariots. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Vault 3</ENAMEX>, the smallest so far opened to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX>, is a command post with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">68</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> in war robes. Other vaults await <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> openings. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the most recent, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">one kilometer</NUMEX> from the vaults now open to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX>, contains stone armor, the oldest ever found in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>. 
Huaqing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hot Springs</ENAMEX>
History and natural beauty mingle easily at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Huaqing Hot Springs</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Huaqingchi</ENAMEX>), a popular side trip for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> on the way to or from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Qin terra cotta warriors excavations</ENAMEX>. The spa‚Äôs hot, mineral-rich waters and its situation on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Black Horse Mountain</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lishan</ENAMEX>) attracted a series of royal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patrons</ENAMEX> as far back as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the eighth century</TIMEX> b.c. The emperors and their retinue required suitable accommodation, so the place was provided with delightful pavilions, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pools</ENAMEX>, and gardens.
There is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> attraction in particular that draws crowds of eager <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX>: the large, mosaic-bottomed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oval Tub</ENAMEX> used by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lady Yangguifei</ENAMEX>, favorite concubine of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tang</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Emperor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Xuanzong</ENAMEX> (who reigned a.d. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">712‚Äì756</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lady Yang</ENAMEX> was known as a famous beauty, and her portrait, hanging in her former dressing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>, attests to that. It is said that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> who wash their face in the basin will look <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten years</TIMEX> younger. Although she was dear to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emperor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lady Yang‚</ENAMEX>Äôs extravagances and intrigues angered courtiers. When mutinous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> demanded her head, the intimidated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emperor</ENAMEX> acceded to save his throne. After she was taken away and strangled, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emperor</ENAMEX> wept and then abdicated. The sad story is the subject of many classic poems.
Qianling Tombs
Xi‚Äôan is surrounded by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of huge earthen <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mounds¬†‚Äî¬†the</ENAMEX> largely unopened tombs of emperors and their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX>. The tombs of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">notables of the Tang Dynasty</ENAMEX>, dug into a mountainside (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Liangshan</ENAMEX>) <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 80 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 miles</NUMEX>) northwest of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xi‚Äôan</ENAMEX>, provide an intriguing look at what lies buried around the old capital and at the level of art and culture reached in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> during the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">seventh</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">eighth</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">ninth</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX>.
Several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tombs</ENAMEX> here contain exquisite murals. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">famous</ENAMEX> set of frescoes in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tomb</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prince</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhanghuai</ENAMEX> depicts an animated polo match, a hunting expedition, a reception for foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diplomats</ENAMEX>, and (most movingly) a scene in a court cloister with a young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">concubine</ENAMEX> looking longingly at a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bird</ENAMEX> in flight. A <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tomb</ENAMEX> with a steeply inclined entrance, that of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Princess</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yong Tai</ENAMEX>, has a mural which is full of intriguing details depicting the court <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">maidens</ENAMEX> attending the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">princess</ENAMEX> (who was to die at the age of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX>). These tombs have also yielded brightly colored ceramic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">figurines</ENAMEX>, fine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stone carvings</ENAMEX>, and large memorial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tablets</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principal</ENAMEX> tomb belongs to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> Tang <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emperor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gaozong</ENAMEX>, and to his ambitious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">widow</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wuzetian</ENAMEX>, who had herself promoted to the rank of empress in <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a.d. 691¬†‚Äî¬</NUMEX>†the only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> to hold such power in all <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> history. Gigantic stone sculptures of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generals</ENAMEX>, and (now headless) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ambassadors</ENAMEX> line the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Way</ENAMEX> to this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tomb</ENAMEX>, but its entrance remains sealed. The ostentation of the exterior hints at what might lie within.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">What‚Äôs</ENAMEX> still buried at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xi‚</ENAMEX>Äôan seems likely to outweigh all the great treasures that have been brought to light, from a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stone Age</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Emperor‚Äôs</ENAMEX> vast <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">City of the Dead</ENAMEX>, from the silks and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ceramics</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tang</ENAMEX> to the walls and pagodas of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ming</ENAMEX>.
Briefings
The following <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> and sights are among the additional attractions that might be included on tours and itineraries.
Anyang, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Henan Province</ENAMEX>. Capital of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shang Dynasty</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3,000 years ago</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anyang</ENAMEX> has fascinated and rewarded archaeologists for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past half-century</TIMEX>.

Conghua <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hot Springs</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Guangdong Province</ENAMEX>. Local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">warlords</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kuomintang</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> were among the early <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patrons</ENAMEX> of this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">spa</ENAMEX>, surrounded by hills covered with bamboo, plum, magnolia, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">cypress trees</ENAMEX>.

Because of a history of foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">occupation</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> is an eclectic medley of architectural styles: <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> seasoned with a dash of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>, a pinch of old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX>, and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forcible</ENAMEX> hint of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> socialist realism. Across the peninsula from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port</ENAMEX> are green <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX>, cozy coves, and sandy beaches.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fuzhou</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Foochow</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fujian Province</ENAMEX>. Halfway down the coast between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shanghai</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guangzhou, Fuzhou</ENAMEX> is the sentimental <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">home</ENAMEX> where the graves of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forefathers</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of overseas <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> are found. It was one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treaty Ports</ENAMEX> open to foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">settlement</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th century</TIMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hainan Island</ENAMEX>. This tropical island off the southernmost tip of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>, nearly <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> times the size of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Corsica</ENAMEX>, provides <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coconuts</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sugar</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rubber</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">It‚Äôs</ENAMEX> also destined for promotion as one of those paradise islands Western <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> dream about. The original <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhabitants</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Li</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miao</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minorities</ENAMEX>, live in the rainforests of the interior, preserving a rich folklore; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Han</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> make up most of the coastal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. The island‚Äôs biggest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Haikou</ENAMEX> (on the north shore), has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a bustling</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> life. The beautiful, palm-shaded beaches are on the southern shore¬†‚Äî¬†big enough, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> reckon, for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100,000</NUMEX> sunbathers.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jingdezhen</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chingtehchen</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jiangxi Province</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jingdezhen</ENAMEX> has been producing famous pottery since the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Han Dynasty</ENAMEX>. White <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">clay</ENAMEX> from a nearby mountain made possible the very thin, durable, translucent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">porcelain</ENAMEX>. The mountain, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gaoling</ENAMEX>, gave its name to kaolin, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">clay</ENAMEX> used to make <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">porcelain</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Tourists</ENAMEX> visit an ancient kiln as well as modern <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ceramics</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factories</ENAMEX> that turn out copies of classic designs.

(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxygen</ENAMEX> is provided in the guesthouse and on the sightseeing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">buses</ENAMEX>.) In any event, determined <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">travelers</ENAMEX> find accommodation rather scarce and very expensive. Apart from the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">majestic Himalayan scenery</ENAMEX>, the top attraction in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lhasa</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Potala¬†‚Äî¬†a</ENAMEX> fabulous <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>-story <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> combining the functions of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX>, fortress, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monastery</ENAMEX>, and dungeon. Other temples, reopened since <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> granted the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Tibetans</ENAMEX> greater religious freedom in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1980</TIMEX>, are now on the itinerary as well.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ningbo</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ningpo</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Zhejiang Province</ENAMEX>. Situated down the coast from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shanghai</ENAMEX>, this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port town</ENAMEX> has a long history of overseas <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">connections</ENAMEX>. First it was involved in trade with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>. Then the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> arrived and settled here. Finally, a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> consulate was established in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> after the end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Opium Wars</ENAMEX>.
