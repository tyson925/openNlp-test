A Brief History
C reteâ€™s long history is bound with its strategic position at the crossroads between <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Western Europe</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Middle East</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North Africa</ENAMEX>. In good times this brought trade, ideas, and prosperity; in bad <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">timesÂ â€”Â invasion</ENAMEX>, oppression, and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>. Many fascinating legacies around the island attest to the complicated web that time has spun here. Each era has left its distinctive mark.
The earliest human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">remains</ENAMEX> found on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crete</ENAMEX> date back to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the seventh millennium</TIMEX> b.c. These <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhabitants</ENAMEX> were <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Neolithic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cave dwellers</ENAMEX> who came from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asia Minor</ENAMEX>. They developed into <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX> with settlements and pastureland on the fertile <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">MessarÃ¡ Plain</ENAMEX>. It was an influx of new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">settlers</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bronze Age</ENAMEX> skills around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3000</TIMEX> b.c. that ushered in the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Minoan</ENAMEX> era, the first major civilization to arise on <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> soil.
The Minoans
A great ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cretan</ENAMEX> civilization was for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many years</TIMEX> believed to be the stuff of mythology. Yet with the discovery of marvelous artifacts and evidence of its <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>, Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arthur Evans</ENAMEX>, its principal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocate</ENAMEX>, made reality out of folklore and myth (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX>). We now know many facts about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Minoan Crete</ENAMEX> including that at the height of its influence, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> probably numbered <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 2 million</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about four</NUMEX> times greater than todayâ€™s figure, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in the capital, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">KnossÃ³s</ENAMEX>.
These early <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">settlements</ENAMEX> were built without fortifications and comprised vast numbers of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dwellings</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> developed ergonomically rather than to any grand design. The first palatial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KnossÃ³s</ENAMEX>, and other great <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PhaistÃ³s</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MÃ¡lia</ENAMEX>, were erected around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> b.c., but these were destroyed by an earthquake <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">300 years later</TIMEX>. The remains visible <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> are their replacements, even bigger and more splendid than the originals. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golden Age</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Minoan societyÂ â€”Â known</ENAMEX> as the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">New Palace</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">eraÂ â€”Â lasted</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">300 years</TIMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Minoans</ENAMEX> were ruled by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priest-king</ENAMEX> who presided over both religious and economic affairs. It is unclear whether he reigned over the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX>, or if each palace settlement had its own regional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX>. His <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> worshipped the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mother Goddess</ENAMEX>, and divine power symbolized by the bull, for whom they performed ornate and elaborate rituals. One sacred <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">symbol</ENAMEX>, which is at odds with their peaceful lifestyle, is the labrys (double-headed sword). Its image has been found on various artifacts throughout the island.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Minoans</ENAMEX> developed an alphabet and printing method, along with sophisticated plumbing and water delivery systems. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Women</ENAMEX> enjoyed high status, playing an active part in palace life, and the whole <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> enjoyed athletic contests, games, and a whole range of recreational activities. Above all, they excelled in the visual arts. 
Wherever there was a blank â€˜canvasâ€™ there was imagery: decorative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">entrances</ENAMEX>, walls, floors, and pottery. Many breathtaking examples can be seen in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Archaeology Museum</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IrÃ¡klion.</ENAMEX> The smallest items, such as combs, were exquisitely worked. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Gold</ENAMEX> and precious <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stones</ENAMEX> were fashioned into beautiful jewelry, all of which indicates a high quality of life for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. 
What fueled this great <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Empire</ENAMEX> was trade. Cretans exhibited their skills with paint, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">clay</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">copper</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bronze</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX> was highly prized and raw materials flowed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inÂ â€”Â lapis lazuli</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ivory</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Syria</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">silver</ENAMEX>, and black obsidian from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anatolia</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Copper</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bronze</ENAMEX> were worked and re-exported, along with high quality <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foodstuffs</ENAMEX> such as olive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">honey</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Minoans</ENAMEX> developed into one of the great naval powers of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX>, with the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wood</ENAMEX> from the vast cypress forests providing material for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX>. But they concentrated their power more for commercial than military gain, showing a taste for the good life rather than a hunger for an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX>. 
This great civilization came to a sudden, catastrophic end around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1450</TIMEX> b.c. The exact cause remains unknown, but all the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palaces</ENAMEX> were destroyed at the same time. The charred remains at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KnossÃ³s</ENAMEX> and ash at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ZÃ¡kros</ENAMEX> suggest a great conflagration. A leading theory for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many years</TIMEX> was that natural disaster struck the island in the wake of the volcanic explosion on the island of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ThÃ­ra</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santorini</ENAMEX>), due north of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crete</ENAMEX>, bringing a maelstrom of tidal waves, earthquakes, and fire storms. The most recent research has uncovered evidence supporting another hypothesisÂ â€”Â that an attack by invaders or rebel <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> may have brought about the end of this fine culture. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Scholars</ENAMEX> will continue to debate the reason for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many years</TIMEX> to come.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dorians</ENAMEX> and Romans
After the disaster, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mycenean Greeks</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peloponnese</ENAMEX> moved in to control what remained of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Minoan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">settlementsÂ â€”Â they</ENAMEX> may even have precipitated the destruction. Around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1200</TIMEX> b.c., <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dorian</ENAMEX> invaders from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Balkans</ENAMEX> drove south through the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> mainland, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aegean</ENAMEX> islands, and across to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crete</ENAMEX>. 
Many coastal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dwellers</ENAMEX> migrated to remote mountain <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> in order to escape their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enemies</ENAMEX>. Others embarked on an overseas exodus that took them around the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean Sea</ENAMEX>. The island did not get directly involved in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Greeceâ€™s Persian</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Peloponnesian Wars</ENAMEX>, however it became well-known as a valuable source of brave and energetic mercenaries.
While mainland <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX> was reaching its zenith during the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Classical Age</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">480â€“338 b.c.</ENAMEX>), the island remained a backwater of warring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">city-states</ENAMEX>, of which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">GÃ³rtis</ENAMEX> was the most powerful. Nevertheless, the enlightened <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Athenians</ENAMEX> acknowledged <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crete</ENAMEX> as a source of much of their culture, and its caves and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrines</ENAMEX> were major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> of pilgrimage. The islandâ€™s most important <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">achievementÂ â€”Â and</ENAMEX> only significant remnantÂ â€”Â from this period is the law code of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GÃ³rtis</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX>). It reveals a hierarchical society of free <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>, serfs, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">slaves</ENAMEX> ruled by an aristocratic class. 
It took the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Romans</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three years</TIMEX> of brutal fighting to conquer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crete</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">67 b.c.</TIMEX>, and they did so only by playing the rival city-states against one another. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crete</ENAMEX> remained a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Empire</ENAMEX> until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a.d. 395</TIMEX>, with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GÃ³rtis</ENAMEX> as its capital. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Romans</ENAMEX> managed to bring a certain order to the island, putting an end to internal struggles, building new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ports</ENAMEX>, and aqueducts, and introducing systems of domestic plumbing and central heating not greatly inferior to those found <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> Birthpains
The apostle <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul</ENAMEX> arrived in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a.d. 59</TIMEX> with his disciple <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Titus</ENAMEX>, whom he left behind to convert the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">islanders</ENAMEX> to Christianity. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Titus</ENAMEX> had a hard time combating the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cretansâ</ENAMEX>€™ pagan beliefs, and was martyred for his overzealous efforts. But Christianity eventually triumphed to achieve the strong <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Orthodoxy</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Titus</ENAMEX> became <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Creteâ</ENAMEX>€™s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patron saint</ENAMEX>.
When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> power split in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>, the eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Byzantine Empire</ENAMEX> inherited the island (though its hold on islands in the south of its dominion were, in reality, nominal). Attacks by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pirates</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Islamic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> brought terror to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cretans</ENAMEX> remained loyal to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Orthodox Church</ENAMEX> throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">occupation</ENAMEX> of a.d. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">824â€“961</NUMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> was recaptured after a terrible siege of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IrÃ</ENAMEX>¡klion by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Byzantine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commander</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">NikephÃ³ros PhokÃ¡s</ENAMEX>. He catapulted the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heads</ENAMEX> of dead <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arabs</ENAMEX> into the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> to dishearten those still defending the citadel.
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Venetian Days</ENAMEX>
After <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Byzantium</ENAMEX> fell to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Crusaders</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crete</ENAMEX> was given to their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boniface of Montferrat</ENAMEX>, who immediately sold it to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venice</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,000</NUMEX> silver marks, ushering in a new era. Crete prospered greatly under the 465 years of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Venetian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">occupation</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1204â€“1669</ENAMEX>), although there were revolts by the native <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, which were brutally put down. As a source of shipbuilding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">timber</ENAMEX> in a key location, the island was a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">kingpin</ENAMEX> in the far flung commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX>, and became the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Republicâ€™s</ENAMEX> first formally constituted overseas <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX>. 
Proudly emblazoned with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lion of St. Mark</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ports</ENAMEX> and fortifications of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IrÃ¡klion</ENAMEX> (called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Candia</ENAMEX> under <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Venetian</ENAMEX> rule, as was the whole of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crete</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ChaniÃ¡</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RÃ</ENAMEX>©thymnon <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bear witness</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Venetiansâ</ENAMEX>€™ ambitious public <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> program. Several handsome villas and loggias still attest to their gracious style of living. 
Gradually <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cretans</ENAMEX> settled down to intermarry with the occupiers and to participate in their style of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>.
The arts flourished during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16th and 17th centuries</TIMEX>, a period known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cretan Renaissance</ENAMEX>. Numerous new monasteries and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX> were built. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Icon</ENAMEX> painting was at its height with an influx of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> from around <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Byzantium</ENAMEX> who founded important <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> of art. The great literary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">figure</ENAMEX> of the time, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VitsÃ©nzos KornÃ¡ros</ENAMEX>, wrote a romantic epic poem in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cretan</ENAMEX> dialect, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ErotÃ³kritos</ENAMEX>. Even if it has since lost its traditional hold in the mountain <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX>, it is still acclaimed among the literati of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RÃ©thymnon.</ENAMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Battle for Crete</ENAMEX>
In the east, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> were in retreat as a new <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Moslem</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">power</ENAMEX> began to rise. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottoman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turks</ENAMEX> pushed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Venetian</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asia Minor</ENAMEX>, through the islands of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aegean</ENAMEX>, until they had left the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> mainland. Eventually it would be <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Creteâ</ENAMEX>€™s turn. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turks</ENAMEX> waged a titanic war to wrest the island from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Venetians</ENAMEX>. It began with raids on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">ChaniÃ¡ and SitÃ­a</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1530s</TIMEX> by the notorious pirate, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barbarossa Khair el-Din</ENAMEX>. Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next century</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Venetians</ENAMEX> greatly strengthened the fortifications, but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ChaniÃ¡</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RÃ©thymnon</ENAMEX> fell in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1645</TIMEX>.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Two years later</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turks</ENAMEX> laid siege to the capital, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Candia</ENAMEX>. It was an epic struggle, which was to last <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22 years</TIMEX>. Initially weakened by an outbreak of plague, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12,000</NUMEX> strong population rallied to the cause. After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15 years</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commander</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hussein Pasha</ENAMEX>, was summoned back to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Constantinople</ENAMEX> and publicly strangled for his failure to take the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. It is said that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defenders</ENAMEX> died but there were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">118,000</NUMEX> fatalities among the besiegers.
Though <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Western Europeâ€™s</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> watched with baited breath, they sent little support, and inexorably <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Venetian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> was worn away. As the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">conquerors</ENAMEX> entered the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> gates in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1699</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Venetians</ENAMEX> negotiated an orderly departure, taking with them, among other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> artifacts, the cherished <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saint Titus</ENAMEX>. This most symbolic of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Creteâ</ENAMEX>€™s religious relics was not to return to the island until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1966</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rule</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Creteâ€™s</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> spent under the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turks</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1669â€“1898</ENAMEX>) constituted a period of cultural and economic stagnation. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ottoman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> had no interest in developing or investing in their dominions and, after the occasionally oppressive but often brilliant centuries of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Venetian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crete</ENAMEX> slid back into the dark ages.
Apart from repairing the islandsâ€™ fortifications, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ottomans</ENAMEX> left few lasting remnants of their rule. They built no new mosques, preferring to convert existing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX>, and left only a few <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>. Most numerous of their legacies are the ornate street fountains found in the corners of market squares and outside of chapels. 
There were sporadic attempts at revolt, often launched from remote mountain <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">strongholds</ENAMEX> where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rebels</ENAMEX> could survive in safety. The more vulnerable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> on the lower plains paid a high price for these in the form of swift bloody reprisals. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> major rebellion occurred in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1770</TIMEX> when the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russians</ENAMEX>, hoping to distract the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turks</ENAMEX> while they waged their own attacks on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottoman Empire</ENAMEX> elsewhere, promised support to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DhaskaloyiÃ¡nnis</ENAMEX>, a wealthy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shipowner</ENAMEX>. He raised a revolt in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">SfakiÃ¡</ENAMEX>, but the support never arrived. The rebellion was crushed, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DhaskaloyiÃ¡nnis</ENAMEX> was flayed alive, and the event became the subject of a rousing epic poem. There were notable uprisings in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1828</TIMEX> when its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> were killed at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FrangokÃ¡stello</ENAMEX>, and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1866</TIMEX> when <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> died in a suicide bombing at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ArkÃ¡di Monastery</ENAMEX>. It is not surprising that at this time many <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>-dwelling <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cretans</ENAMEX> kept a low profile. They publicly converted to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Islam</ENAMEX> to escape heavy taxes, continuing to practice their <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Orthodox</ENAMEX> faith in secret.
However, once <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX> had achieved independence from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottoman Empire</ENAMEX> after the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">War of 1821</ENAMEX>, the atmosphere changed. Though <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crete</ENAMEX> had to endure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nearly a century</TIMEX> more of subjection to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> domination it stirred the blood of many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">native sons</ENAMEX> who vowed to rid the island of its oppressors. The ferocity of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later</TIMEX> Cretan resistance against the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turks</ENAMEX> had all the trademarks of their fiercely independent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spirit</ENAMEX>. Violent insurrections provoked equally violent massacres in retaliation; and death came to form a monumental collective badge of honor.
The islandâ€™s repeated suffering was duly celebrated in the popular heroic Songs of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dighenis</ENAMEX> (adapted from their medieval origins for the modern struggle), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pandelis Prevelakisâ</ENAMEX>€™ grim novel, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Cretan</ENAMEX>, and the lofty writings of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NÃ­kos KazantzÃ¡kis.</ENAMEX>
Union with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX>
Finally, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1898</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> powers forced the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turks</ENAMEX> to grant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crete</ENAMEX> autonomy within the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottoman Empire</ENAMEX> and accept <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Prince George</ENAMEX>, second <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX>, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX>. This did not satisfy the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prince</ENAMEX> was forced to resign <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">only a few years later</TIMEX> under threat of revolt and the demand for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">union</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX>. It was only in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1913</TIMEX>, under the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ElefthÃ©rios VenizÃ©los</ENAMEX>, a native <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cretan</ENAMEX>, that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">longed-for Ã©nosis</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">union</ENAMEX>) was achieved.
Though unscathed by <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War I</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crete</ENAMEX> saw major changes in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid 1920s</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">AtatÃ¼rk revolution</ENAMEX>, which announced a new <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Republic</ENAMEX>, brought massive upheaval through the area with a forced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> exchange between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Turkey</ENAMEX> beginning in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1923</TIMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turks</ENAMEX> were evacuated, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">refugees</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asia Minor</ENAMEX> arrived to take their place. However, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agricultural resources</ENAMEX> and output were improved and the new arrivals soon began to settle. The new science of archaeology was also developing, and excavations of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minoan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palaces</ENAMEX> brought a new prosperity as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 20th-century</TIMEX> phenomenon of tourism grew.
War and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peace</ENAMEX>
Creteâ€™s pains were not yet over, however. During <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX>, the rapid advance of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> through mainland <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1941</TIMEX> forced the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Allies</ENAMEX> to retreat to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crete</ENAMEX>. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20 May</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> invaded the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> and secured the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airfield</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maleme</ENAMEX> to the west of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ChaniÃ¡.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Australian</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Zealand</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX> joined <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cretan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">militia</ENAMEX> during a valiant defense in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten-day</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Battle of Crete</ENAMEX>, but were ultimately forced to retreat across the island. Many were evacuated to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX>, though <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several thousand</NUMEX> were left stranded and fled to the mountains. Casualties on both sides were terrible: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Allied</ENAMEX> losses numbered <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,000</NUMEX> killed and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12,000</NUMEX> taken <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prisoner</ENAMEX>, while the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> war <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cemetery</ENAMEX> contains <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">almost 4,500 graves</NUMEX>. 
With their tradition of resistance to foreign invaders, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cretans</ENAMEX> kept up constant guerrilla warfare against the occupying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Axis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX>. Efforts to shelter the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Allies</ENAMEX> and smuggle them off the island in small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> from isolated south coast beaches were remarkably successful. But the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> army wreaked brutal reprisals on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1944</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> pulled off an amazing coup by kidnapping the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commander</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Kreipe</ENAMEX>, and smuggling him off the island. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later</TIMEX> marched through the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">AmÃ¡ri Valley</ENAMEX>, burning <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> to the ground and killing any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> they could find. The occupation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crete</ENAMEX> did not end until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 1945</TIMEX>.
Much of the island was left in ruins from heavy bombing, but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crete</ENAMEX> escaped the internal strife of the civil war that raged in mainland <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1947â€“1949</ENAMEX>) and felt fewer effects of the oppressive â€˜rule of the colonelsâ€™ (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1967â€“1974</ENAMEX>) than other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX>. Relative calm now reigns on the political front, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greeceâ€™s</ENAMEX> economic prospects have strengthened since it joined the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Union</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1981</TIMEX>. There have been profound changes on the island, which was until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1950s</TIMEX> almost exclusively agricultural. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crete</ENAMEX> has been a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">beneficiary</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Greeceâ</ENAMEX>€™s huge increase in tourism, and has become one of the most prosperous <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>.
