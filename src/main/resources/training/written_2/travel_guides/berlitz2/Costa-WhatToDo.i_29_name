What to Do
Sports
Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Costa del</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sol</ENAMEX> do not plan <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daytime</TIMEX> activities more energetic than lazing on the beach, and save their energy for nightlife. However, sports facilities are in abundance for those who want to work off the effects of too much paella during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the daylight hours</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Water Sports</ENAMEX>
The main <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> beaches offer all kinds of sports equipment for rent, as well as beach umbrellas and loungers. The larger beach <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> have toilet <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX>, and some provide changing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX>.
Swimming: With <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">more than 160 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100 miles</NUMEX>) of beaches, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Costa del</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sol</ENAMEX> offers plenty of spots for swimming. Most of the sandy strands lie to the west of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M√°laga</ENAMEX>, while shingle and rocks (with some sandy coves) predominate to the east. In the high <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX>, the most popular beaches are mobbed. You stand the best chance of finding a patch of sand to yourself to the east of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nerja</ENAMEX> and west of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Estepona</ENAMEX>.
Many beaches now fly the blue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX> flag, which means that water quality and general sanitation meets environmental standards established by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Union</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boating</ENAMEX>: There are numerous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">marinas</ENAMEX> along the coast between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M√°laga</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sotogrande</ENAMEX>, providing year-round moorings for yachts and motor <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX>. Some offer <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX> rentals and longer-term charters (with or without <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">captain</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crew</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marbella</ENAMEX> boasts <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> such <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">establishments</ENAMEX>, and many of the beaches and larger beach <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> rent sailboats.
Waterskiing: The main <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX> all have water skiing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>, and most big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> offer instruction. Prices are generally high, but they do vary. Swimming and skiing areas often overlap.
Windsurfing: This sport is the coast‚Äôs fastest-growing activity, with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boards</ENAMEX>, sails, and professional instruction available in most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">resort areas</ENAMEX>. The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX> runs from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March to November</TIMEX> with strongest winds in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June and September</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Snorkeling</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scuba Diving</ENAMEX>: Snorkeling can be an engrossing activity, particularly off the rocky, indented stretch of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">coast</ENAMEX> beyond <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nerja</ENAMEX>. If you dive or snorkel any distance from the shore, you are legally required to tow a marker buoy. Diving <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> operate in several resorts. For more information, contact the local tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">124</NUMEX>).
Angling: Fishing from the rocks and breakwaters is a popular pastime with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locals</ENAMEX> and a permit is not required. The deeper <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX> offshore teem with tunny (tuna), swordfish, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">shark</ENAMEX>. Deep-sea fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> can be rented at the marinas, and many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort hotels</ENAMEX> make arrangements for fishing expeditions.
A very popular inland fishing spot is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pantanos del Chorro</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">pantano meaning ‚Äúreservoir‚Äù</ENAMEX>) at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Chorro Dam</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX>). Freshwater anglers must have a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">permit¬†‚Äî¬†ask</ENAMEX> at the nearest tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> for information on how to obtain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>.
Other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sports</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golf</ENAMEX>: When it comes to variety, few <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">resort areas</ENAMEX> in the world can compare with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Costa del</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sol</ENAMEX>. There are nearly <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> 18-hole courses between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M√°laga</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gibraltar</ENAMEX>. Most private and hotel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clubs</ENAMEX> welcome non-residents or non-members, though some may charge visitors a higher fee. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clubs</ENAMEX>, caddies, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">carts</ENAMEX> are generally available for rental.
The quality of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX> is excellent¬†‚Äî¬†many have been designed by such famous names as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Trent Jones</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seve Ballesteros</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Las Brisas</ENAMEX>, near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Marbella</ENAMEX>, has hosted the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Spanish Open</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Valderrama</ENAMEX>, near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sotogrande</ENAMEX>, was host to the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">1997 Ryder Cup</ENAMEX>. Although a private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">club</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valderrama</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> starting times between <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midday</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">2pm</ENAMEX> that are open to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX>, albeit at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30,000</NUMEX> ptas (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a180.3</NUMEX>) per round.
For details of golf <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX> and fees, consult the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Costa Golf</ENAMEX>, an English-language <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publication</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">Tennis</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Squash</ENAMEX>: Some of the biggest names in <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">tennis</ENAMEX> are linked to the numerous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clubs</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúranches‚Äù</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Costa del</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sol</ENAMEX>, including the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Marbella</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manolo Santana Tennis Club</ENAMEX>, which hosts the majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spain‚Äôs Davis Cup</ENAMEX> matches and other important tournaments.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bicycling</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">Bikes</ENAMEX> can be rented at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> up and down the coast and inland (where mountain <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">trails</ENAMEX> are ideal for mountain biking).
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hiking</ENAMEX>: There are a number of good hiking areas within easy reach of the coast, notably the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Montes de M√°laga National Park</ENAMEX> just north of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M√°laga</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Torcal</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">El Chorro</ENAMEX> a little farther inland (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX>). For more good walks, try the area around <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ronda</ENAMEX>, and the hills above the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Refugio de Juanar</ENAMEX> near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Marbella</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41</NUMEX>).
Hunting: The foothills of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sierra Nevada</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">harbor rabbit</ENAMEX> and partridge, while deeper in the mountains <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">lurk deer</ENAMEX>. There are hunting grounds in the area north of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marbella</ENAMEX>, especially in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Serran√≠a de Ronda</ENAMEX> and, closer to the coast, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sierra Blanca</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41</NUMEX>). The season for game runs <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">roughly</NUMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the months</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">September‚ÄìDecember</ENAMEX>, while small <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> may generally be hunted from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">October‚</ENAMEX>Äì <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February</TIMEX>. A hunting permit is required.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Horseback Riding</ENAMEX>: Andaluc√≠a is famous for both its <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX> and horsemanship. There are stables on the coast and near the inland <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>, with mounts for rent; you can canter along the open beach or ride up into the hills.
Skiing: Few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> think of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Costa del</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sol</ENAMEX> as a ski <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX>, but skiing can be enjoyed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between December</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Solynieve</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> near <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Granada</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">160 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100 miles</NUMEX>) northeast of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M√</ENAMEX>°laga in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sierra Nevada</ENAMEX>. Situated near the summit of mount <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Veleta</ENAMEX>, it is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Europe‚</ENAMEX>Äôs southernmost ski <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shopping</ENAMEX>
Most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">establishments</ENAMEX> are open <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">from 9:30 or 10am‚Äì1:30 or 2:00pm and from 4:30‚Äì8:00pm</TIMEX>. The siesta (see below) is still religiously observed in southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> in the tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX> keep <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">longer hours</TIMEX>, staying open <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all day</TIMEX> until <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:30pm</TIMEX> or sometimes later. Department <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> do not close for the siesta.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> government levies a value-added tax (called IVA) on most items (currently <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">up to 13.8%</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Tourists</ENAMEX> from outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX> will be refunded the IVA they pay on purchases above a minimum of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">15,000 ptas</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a90.15</NUMEX>) or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">US$100</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> where they see the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAX FREE SHOPPING</ENAMEX> logo. Whenever you make a purchase, simply ask for a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Global Refund Check</ENAMEX>. Then when you declare your purchases at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Customs</ENAMEX>, your check will be validated. The check can then be cashed at a nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Cash Refund Office</ENAMEX> or at any of the International Cash Refund <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> worldwide. Another option that may be more convenient is to mail the check to a Cash <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Refund Office</ENAMEX> and have your credit card account automatically credited. It‚Äôs worthwhile if you plan on spending a lot in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> place.
Markets
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Weekly</TIMEX> open-air markets are held <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Mondays</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Marbella</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesdays</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nerja</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fuengirola</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesdays</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Estepona</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thursdays</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Torremolinos</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">San</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pedro de Alc√°ntara</ENAMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Fridays</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Benalm√°dena.</ENAMEX> Most <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> have a rastro (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">flea</ENAMEX> market) on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX>. Of these, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sevilla‚</ENAMEX>Äôs is the largest and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> also has a coin-and-stamp and small animal market on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the same day</TIMEX>.
Where to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shop</ENAMEX>
The larger <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> offer lower prices and a better selection of goods than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Torremolinos</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fuengirola</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">El Corte Ingl√©s</ENAMEX> department store in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">M√°laga</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sevilla</ENAMEX>, and other places is also well worth looking for.
For more sophisticated shopping, nothing can compare with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marbella</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Ban√∫s</ENAMEX>, where <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozens</NUMEX> of attractive harborfront <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boutiques</ENAMEX> offer a stunning selection of merchandise at equally stunning prices.
You can make a considerable saving on luxury goods like jewelry, watches, perfumes, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Havana</ENAMEX> cigars in duty-free <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gibraltar</ENAMEX>, where the dreaded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VAT</ENAMEX> does not exist.
Ceuta, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> protectorate on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">North African</ENAMEX> coast, has special tax status and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX>, for example, is vastly cheaper there than mainland <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>. The same applies to electrical goods etc., but these will not seem like much of a bargain for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>.
What to Buy
Traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">handicrafts</ENAMEX> are high on any souvenir-hunter‚Äôs shopping list.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ceramics</ENAMEX>: Everyday glazed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">terracotta</ENAMEX> pottery can be bought all along the coast. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">There‚Äôs</ENAMEX> also a wide selection of tiles (azulejos), vases, bowls, and jugs, with floral or geometric decorations in bright colors.
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Foodstuffs</ENAMEX>: Take home a taste of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> with some olives, olive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX>, almonds, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cheese</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mouthwatering candies</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cookies</ENAMEX>.
Jewelry: <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Silver</ENAMEX> rings, bracelets, and necklaces in modern designs make good buys, as do the artificial Majorica pearls of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>. Look, too, for fine filigree jewelry from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">C√≥rdoba</ENAMEX>, and smooth, polished olive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wood beads</ENAMEX>.
Leather and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Suede: Choose</ENAMEX> from a wide selection of handbags, belts, wallets, trousers, skirts, and coats. Leather goods, while no longer the bargain they once were, compare favorably in price with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> made articles, and the local <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factories</ENAMEX> do turn out stylish, high-quality leather clothing. C√≥rdoba, which has been producing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">leather goods</ENAMEX> since <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> times, is famous for its embossed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">leather</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beware</ENAMEX>, though, many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">leather goods</ENAMEX> you will see have been imported from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Morocco</ENAMEX> and are sold at vastly inflated prices. It‚Äôs actually cheaper, and much more interesting, to take <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a day</TIMEX> trip to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tangier</ENAMEX> and buy such goods there.
Souvenirs: Often delightfully tacky, from plastic castanets and flamenco dolls to imitation wineskins and even bullfight posters printed with your own name.
Wine and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Spirits</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Sweet M√</ENAMEX>°laga <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sherry</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">brandy</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wines</ENAMEX> provide some of the best bargains in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>, and are generally cheaper when bought in a supermarket than at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the last minute</TIMEX> at the duty-free <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX>.
Entertainment
Tour <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operators</ENAMEX> offer any number of excursions, some more esoteric than others, with brochures and booking <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> available through your <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX> or a local travel <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX>. Another form of organized entertainment, amusement <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX>, are discussed below in the section for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> with young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>.
Bullfights: Andaluc√≠a is famed for its bullfighting traditions, and has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sevilla</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C√≥rdoba</ENAMEX>, of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> first-class <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Plaza de Toros</ENAMEX> (bullrings) in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>. The provincial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capitals</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Almer√≠a</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Granada, Huelva, Ja√©n</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M√</ENAMEX>°laga as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algeciras</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Puerto de Santa Mar√</ENAMEX>≠a are second-class rings. All others, including those of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">resort towns</ENAMEX> along the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Costa del</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sol</ENAMEX>, come into the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> class category. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> main events are a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Corrida de Toros</ENAMEX>, where fully qualified matadors fight fully-grown¬†‚Äî¬†at least <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4 year</TIMEX> old¬<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">†‚Äî¬†toros (bulls</ENAMEX>), and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Novilladas</ENAMEX>, where novilleros (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">novice matadors</ENAMEX>) fight novillos (immature <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bulls</ENAMEX>).
As a rule of thumb, the better events are held in the better plazas, particularly during the fer√≠as (holiday fairs) held in the major <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>. Equally true is the fact that most of the events held in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">resort towns</ENAMEX> are mainly for the benefit of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX>, and are of lesser quality. They are not generally less expensive, though; small rings mean <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fewer</NUMEX> seats, which often equates to higher prices. Contrary to popular opinion, bullfights are not held <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every Sunday</TIMEX> in each <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. In fact, outside of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fer√≠as¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†when they are held daily¬<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">†‚Äî¬†only Sevilla</ENAMEX> has them on a regular basis throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the season</TIMEX>. In other places, with the exception of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Easter Sunday</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 15¬†‚Äî¬</TIMEX>†important national <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">holidays¬†‚Äî¬†they</ENAMEX> are held sporadically and advertised by way of the ubiquitous carteles (posters) stuck on every wall. Be warned, though, these events are never less than <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bloody¬†‚Äî¬†and</ENAMEX> can be much worse. They are, however, enthralling spectacles, and whatever your reaction, you‚Äôll gain a valuable insight into the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>.
Flamenco: All the coastal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX> offer flamenco shows for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX>. These shows can be entertaining, but the performances are more show business than the true spirit of flamenco. To experience flamenco at its most authentic, you will have to search out bars and small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clubs</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">M√</ENAMEX>°laga or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sevilla</ENAMEX>. Ask the local tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> for advice on where to go.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Flamenco</ENAMEX> is an ancient art form, combining elements of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Visigothic, Moorish</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gypsy</ENAMEX> music. There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> distinct types; the cante jondo (deep song), an intense outpouring of emotion, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animated cante chico</ENAMEX> (light song). There are also different varieties of flamenco dance (the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">tango</ENAMEX>, fandango, farruca, and zambra) performed to the staccato rhythms and counter-rhythms of the castanets, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">hand clapping</ENAMEX> (palmadas), and finger snapping (pitos), as well as furious heel-drumming (zapateado). There is no need to speak <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish</ENAMEX> to enjoy the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">spectacle¬†‚Äî¬†you</ENAMEX> simply have to feel the music.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Discotheques</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nightclubs</ENAMEX>: Some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">discos</ENAMEX> open <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">as early as 9pm</TIMEX>, but most don‚Äôt gear up for business until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11pm</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midnight</TIMEX>. They close late, too, around <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4am</ENAMEX> or even later. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nightclubs</ENAMEX> (salas de fiesta) usually stage <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> shows <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an evening</TIMEX>, one at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about midnight</TIMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1am</ENAMEX> and the other around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3am</TIMEX>. Depending on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">club</ENAMEX>, the show may feature flamenco performances, drag acts, or shows with semi-nude <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bars</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pubs</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clubs</ENAMEX> often provide musical entertainment.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Casinos</ENAMEX>: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> gambling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">establishments</ENAMEX> operate from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8pm</TIMEX> to the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early hours</TIMEX>; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Casino Torrequebrada</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Benalm√</ENAMEX>°dena-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Costa</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Casino Marbella</ENAMEX>, under the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hotel Andaluc√≠a Plaza</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Ban√∫s</ENAMEX>. In addition to the usual games, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">casinos</ENAMEX> have a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX>, restaurant, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">nightclub</ENAMEX> on the premises. Formal dress (jacket and tie for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gentlemen</ENAMEX>) is required. Don‚Äôt forget to bring your passport along for identification.
Concerts: From <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T√≠voli World</ENAMEX> brings the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stars</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rock</ENAMEX> and pop to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Torremolinos</ENAMEX> for concerts in the open air. The season‚Äôs program may include performances of flamenco and zarzuela (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> light opera).

Apart from paddling and sandcastles, older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> can learn how to sail, waterski, or windsurf. If you don‚Äôt feel happy about letting your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> play in the sea, especially the younger ones, the water <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mijas, Torremolinos</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Estepona</ENAMEX> offer a safer and more controlled environment where <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">it‚Äôs</ENAMEX> easier to keep a close eye on them.
Alternative diversions for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> include the aquariums in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Benalm√°dena</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Ban√∫s</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eagle Park</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Benalm√°dena</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cueva</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">cave</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">De Nerja</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mini</ENAMEX>- <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX> near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Almer√≠a</ENAMEX>.

The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Crocodile Park</ENAMEX> just north of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M√°laga</ENAMEX> will intrigue most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, as will the horse shows of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">El Ranchito</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Benalm√°dena</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Aires del Sur</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Estepona</ENAMEX>.
When you‚Äôre on the beach, don‚Äôt forget that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> are especially vulnerable to the effects of too much sun. Take along plenty of high-factor sunscreen and sun hats, and make sure they‚Äôre covered up during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the middle of the day</TIMEX> (a siesta during the hottest part of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> may be a good idea to avoid sunburn).
