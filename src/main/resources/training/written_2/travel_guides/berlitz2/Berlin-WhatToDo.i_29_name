What to Do
I n this liveliest of all <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>, there is no lack of activities once your sightseeing day is done. Whatever the vagaries of world politics, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX> has never relinquished its role as national <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> in the realm of the arts or shopping.
Entertainment
Berliners are the most assiduous concert- and theater-goers in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, and you have to plan ahead if you want good tickets for the main events. Ask your travel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX> tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> for details of upcoming programs, and book in advance where possible. In addition to the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</TIMEX> publication <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Berlin Programm</ENAMEX>, produced by the tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>, there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> listings <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazines</ENAMEX>, Tip and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zitty</ENAMEX>, published <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every two weeks</TIMEX>, which give full details and reviews. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Das Magazin</ENAMEX>, a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">quarterly</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> published in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, mixes features, tourist information, and listings.
Music
Symphonic music in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX> is fueled by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of the world‚Äôs greatest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">orchestras</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berliner</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philharmoniker</ENAMEX>, housed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philharmonie</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX>), achieved glory under the late <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herbert von Karajan</ENAMEX>. The highly rated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Radio Symphony Orchestra</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Berlin Symphony Orchestra</ENAMEX> also perform there, while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schinkel‚</ENAMEX>Äôs beautifully restored <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Schauspielhaus</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gendarmenmarkt</ENAMEX> (known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Konzerthaus Berlin</ENAMEX>) is another important venue for classic music performances.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chamber</ENAMEX> music and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lieder</ENAMEX> (song) recitals take place in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kammermusiksaal</ENAMEX> (at the rear of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philharmonie</ENAMEX>), in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ephraimpalais</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nikolaiviertel</ENAMEX>), and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hochschule der K√ºnste</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hardenbergstra√üe</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">Berlin‚Äôs opera</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lovers</ENAMEX> are well-served by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deutsche Oper</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bismarckstra√üe</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Staatsoper Unter den Linden</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Komische Oper</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Behrenstra√üe</ENAMEX>.
Major rock concerts are usually performed in big <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">halls</ENAMEX> such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Max</ENAMEX>-Schmeling-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Halle</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Velodrom</ENAMEX>, the open-air <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Waldb√ºhne</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Olympic Stadium</ENAMEX>. Jazz is particularly popular in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the most famous jazz venues in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quasimodo</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kantstra√üe</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">12a</ENAMEX>), makes its program of upcoming concerts available on its website <www.quasimodo.de>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jazzfest Berlin</ENAMEX> is an annual jazz festival held in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> each <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November</TIMEX>.
Theater
When it comes to theater, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX> is one of the most exciting and innovative <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> and all the world, so that even without a great command of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> language, any enthusiastic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">theatergoer</ENAMEX> can enjoy some stirring performances.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">theaters</ENAMEX> often maintain several productions in repertory, so that in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">any one week</TIMEX> you will be able to see the same <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">troupe</ENAMEX> perform contemporary or classical drama. There are over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">150</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">theaters</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, so there‚Äôs a vast range to choose from.
The city‚Äôs most audacious and versatile repertory is based at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schaub√ºhne</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ku‚Äôdamm</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lehninerplatz</ENAMEX>). It achieved international renown for its almost brutally uncompromising performances of classical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">avant-garde</ENAMEX> and experimental theater. The plays of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Berlin‚</ENAMEX>Äôs best-known <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">playwright</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bertolt Brecht</ENAMEX>, naturally dominate the repertory of the theater he founded, the world-renowned <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berliner Ensemble</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bertolt-Brecht-Platz</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>), although it does expand to other, mostly modern, classics, and promises to further enhance its outstanding reputation under the new artistic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Claus Peymann</ENAMEX>. Contemporary plays are staged at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Maxim-Gorki-Theater</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Am Festungsgraben</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>), and the classics at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deutsches Theater</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schumannstra√üe</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">13a</ENAMEX>), the former <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> of theater <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">producer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Max Reinhardt</ENAMEX>.
Commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">theater</ENAMEX> is not to be sneezed at, either. For the equivalents of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Broadway</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shaftesbury Avenue</ENAMEX> musicals, operettas, and comedies, try the very professional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Theater am Kurf√ºrstendamm</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Kurf√ºrstendamm 209</ENAMEX>), the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kom√∂die</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Kurf√ºrstendamm 206</ENAMEX>), the popular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Theater des Westens</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Kantstra√üe 12</NUMEX>), and the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stella Musical Theater</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Marlene-Dietrich-Platz 1</ENAMEX>).
Other entertainment
Another long-standing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX> tradition, at its heyday in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1920s</TIMEX>, satirical cabaret has always, by its very nature, had to struggle for its existence. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX> has seemed to provide the necessary raw material, a perennially turbulent history to which reunification has not put a stop. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">survivors</ENAMEX> among the countless fly-by<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">-nights</TIMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Die Stachelschweine</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Porcupines</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Europa-Center</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Die Distel</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Thistle, Friedrichstra√üe</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">101</NUMEX>). However, unless your <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> is excellent and you have an in-depth understanding of the political scene, this kind of cabaret will be almost impossible to follow.
Nightclubs range from garish girlie shows to conventional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">discos</ENAMEX>. In between are the transvestite shows, which can be saucy, often witty, occasionally outrageous but only rarely offensive. They offer an amusing perspective of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Berlin‚Äôs</ENAMEX> past with their impersonations of the great <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marlene Dietrich</ENAMEX> and other such figures.
As befits a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> which every <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February</TIMEX> hosts a major <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">International Film Festival</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX> is endowed with a huge number of cinemas, showing a variety of films ranging from the usual <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blockbusters</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">avant-garde</ENAMEX> works of art.
Most foreign-language films are usually dubbed into <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX>, though some cinemas will occasionally show films in the original language. The letters to look for are <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚ÄúOF‚Äù</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Originalfassung¬†‚Äî¬†original</ENAMEX> version).
Sports
Thanks to its many lakes and rivers, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX> does not lack opportunities for swimming, and has <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">around 20</NUMEX> beaches, most of them pleasantly sandy. Continuing the old Prussian devotion to physical culture, a few of the beaches are reserved for nude bathing¬<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">†‚Äî¬†or FKK</ENAMEX>, as you may see it signposted. The most popular of these beaches are the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bullenwinkel on the Grunewaldsee and Strandbad Halensee on the Teufelssee</ENAMEX>. If you would rather wear a swimsuit, try the lovely beaches of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wannsee, Glienicker See</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Havel</ENAMEX>, or the less crowded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gro√üer M√</ENAMEX>ºggelsee in eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Templiner See</ENAMEX>, out at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Potsdam</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Berlin‚Äôs</ENAMEX> sports facilities are <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> to none, thanks to the huge program of building that took place as part of the city‚Äôs bid for the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Olympics</ENAMEX>. There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 1,500</NUMEX> sports venues in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, most impressive of which are the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Max</ENAMEX>-Schmeling-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Halle</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Velodrom</ENAMEX> (both in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prenzlauer Berg</ENAMEX> district).
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Water</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lovers</ENAMEX> should head for the new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Schwimmsporthalle</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Landsberger Alle</ENAMEX>, the beautiful, ornate <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stadtbad Neuk√∂lln</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Berlin‚Äôs Luft und Badeparadies, Blub</ENAMEX> for short, at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Buschkrugallee 64</ENAMEX>: a huge water recreation <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>, offering both indoor and outdoor <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX>, wave and surf pools, water slides, a solarium, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sauna</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>.
At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Berlin‚</ENAMEX>Äôs lakes, you will be able to rent equipment for many different types of watersports, including waterskiing, canoeing, rowing, sailing, and windsurfing.
If you‚Äôd like to try fishing, you can get yourself a good barbecued supper of white <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>, pike perch or eel from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Havel</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M√ºggelsee</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Glienicker See</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX> tourist information <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">124</NUMEX>) will give you details about licenses and boat rental.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">Golf</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enthusiasts</ENAMEX> can get a round in at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Golf und Landclub Berlin-Wannsee Club</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Golfweg 22</NUMEX>).
With the huge successes of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boris Becker</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steffi Graf</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Stich</ENAMEX>, tennis has now become a favorite national sport, with squash and badminton catching on fast, too. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">All three</NUMEX> are well-served, so to speak, at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX> citywide, notably <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stromstra√üe</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brandenburgische Stra√üe</ENAMEX>.
One surprise sport you may not have expected to practice in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX> is hang-gliding, but it is, in fact, possible to throw yourself off the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Teufelsberg</ENAMEX>, where you can also do a little skiing and sledding in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">64</NUMEX>). However, you don‚Äôt have to go in search of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">snow</ENAMEX> to ski; the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Glacier</ENAMEX> ski <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">center</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pankow</ENAMEX> has the longest indoor ski course in the world.
Roller skating has become a way of life in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX>; so much so that from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">spring</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August</TIMEX>, every second <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the month</TIMEX> has been designated <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚ÄúBlade Night</ENAMEX>.‚Äù The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitte</ENAMEX> are closed to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> and open freely to in-line skaters. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the winter</TIMEX>, the fun moves indoors¬<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">†‚Äî¬†‚ÄúBlade Night‚</ENAMEX>Äù is held in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arena</ENAMEX> concert <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Treptow</ENAMEX>. 
The most pleasant defense against the aggressiveness of the city‚Äôs bicycle <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">riders</ENAMEX> is to rent one yourself. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tiergarten</ENAMEX>, meanwhile, joggers and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">roller skaters</ENAMEX> maintain a relationship of mutual disrespect.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spectator Sports</ENAMEX>
The ultimate in professional <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">football</ENAMEX> will be seen when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berlin</ENAMEX> hosts the final of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Soccer World Cup</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2006</TIMEX>, for which the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Olympic Stadium</ENAMEX> is undergoing a massive program of refurbishment. The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Six Day Cycle Race</ENAMEX> has been held <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every January</TIMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Velodrom</ENAMEX>, while the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Max</ENAMEX>-Schmeling-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Halle</ENAMEX> draws basketball <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fans</ENAMEX> by the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> to see the home <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alba Berlin</ENAMEX>, take on the opposition. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International</ENAMEX> tennis tournaments are held at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Rot-Wei√ü</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">club</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Horse</ENAMEX>-racing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enthusiasts</ENAMEX> can check out <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">equine form</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Galopprennbahn Hoppegarten</ENAMEX> and last, but by no means least, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Berlin Marathon</ENAMEX> can be enjoyed from the sidelines throughout the city every <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">autumn</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Children‚Äôs Berlin</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Children</ENAMEX> are well catered to in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX>, and many of the things you‚Äôll want to do¬†‚Äî¬†trips out to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grunewald</ENAMEX>, city tours by <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">canal¬†‚Äî¬†will</ENAMEX> also appeal to young ones. The impressive redevelopment of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Potsdamer Platz</ENAMEX> has much to entertain <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, including an IMAX cinema, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony City</ENAMEX> entertainment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">center</ENAMEX>, where they can lay their hands on the latest electronic gadgets. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Museums: Children</ENAMEX> of many ages will adore the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum</ENAMEX> f√ºr <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">V√∂lkerkunde</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dahlem</ENAMEX>, with its exciting displays of masks, replica <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX>, and huts. Many of the exhibits are accessibly set out at <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>-level. Nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Dom√§ne Dahlem</ENAMEX> is a re-creation of a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> can watch <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> at work, or admire the farm <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spectrum</ENAMEX> section of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Deutsches Technikmuseum</ENAMEX> encourages hands-on activity. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puppentheater</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karl-Marx-Stra√üe</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">135</NUMEX>) is also very appealing.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Parks</ENAMEX> and play areas: Children‚Äôs play areas (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kinderspielplatz</ENAMEX>), with swings and climbing frames, can be found all over the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>.

Both offer special features for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, including children‚Äôs petting zoos and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">playgrounds</ENAMEX>. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shopping</ENAMEX>
Where to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shop</ENAMEX>
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX>, great numbers of smart new shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">malls</ENAMEX> and department <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> have sprung up in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX>, the most exciting of which are in the east of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Areas</ENAMEX> where shopping was once, for many, restricted to the dreary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> and limited goods available under the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">GDR</ENAMEX>, are now burgeoning with the very smartest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designer</ENAMEX> labels. The elegant <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Friedrichstra√üe</ENAMEX> is full of expensive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> offering highly desirable items, with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Galeries Lafayette</ENAMEX> providing an injection of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> style. The revitalized <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Potsdamer Platz</ENAMEX> boasts <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arkaden</ENAMEX>, a large shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> which has proven very popular with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Berliners</ENAMEX> alike.
In the western <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">areas</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, trendy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boutiques</ENAMEX> and large department <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wertheim</ENAMEX> line the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ku‚Äôdamm</ENAMEX> itself, while the cherished <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KaDeWe</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wittenbergplatz</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Europa-Center</ENAMEX>, a multi-story shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mall</ENAMEX>, are close at hand. Many elegant shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> lead off to the north and south of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ku‚Äôdamm.</ENAMEX>
Most of the city‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> are open from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9am until 8pm</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monday‚ÄìFriday.</ENAMEX> But many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, especially in quiet neighborhoods, may close <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX>. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturdays</TIMEX> most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> are open from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9am until 4pm</TIMEX>, although from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early November</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-December</TIMEX>, a new innovation called the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">‚ÄúSeven Shopping Weekends‚Äù</ENAMEX> provides extended weekend <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX>, with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each weekend</TIMEX> following a different theme dedicated to various aspects of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Berlin‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX>. Except for those in major train <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stations</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airports</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> are closed on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sundays</TIMEX>. 
What to Buy
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Antiques</ENAMEX>
Any moderately priced furniture or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">porcelain</ENAMEX> that claims to be Baroque or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rococo</ENAMEX> is probably a copy. Your best bet is to concentrate on products of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 20th centuries</TIMEX>. Try looking down some of the side-<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> off the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ku‚Äôdamm.</ENAMEX>
Books
For book <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lovers</ENAMEX>, the bookshops on and around <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Savignyplatz</ENAMEX> offer a superb selection of books on art and design, architecture, fashion, and film.

Bric-a-brac
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Collectors</ENAMEX> of faded old photos, period clothes, and other souvenirs from the past will love rummaging around in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin‚</ENAMEX>Äôs many flea markets. Among the best are the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berliner</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Antik- und Flohmarkt</ENAMEX> located in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S-Bahn</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arches</ENAMEX> beneath <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bahnhof Friedrichstra√üe</ENAMEX> (closed on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tues</ENAMEX>), and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zillehof</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fasanenstra√üe</ENAMEX> (open <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mon‚ÄìSat</ENAMEX>).

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Porcelain and Linen</ENAMEX>
