Where To Go
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> has fascinating <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">districts</ENAMEX> and neighborhoods to stroll. However, the main attractions are scattered throughout this sprawling <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, so you‚Äôll be taking frequent <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">taxi</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bus</ENAMEX>, or subway rides no matter where your <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX> is located. Following the ancient city plan, we have divided the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> like a compass, with the downtown sights in the center surrounded by quadrants to the north, south, east, and west.
The main urban area of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> covers <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">750 sq km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">290 sq miles</NUMEX>), with the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Forbidden City and Tiananmen Square</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Chang‚Äôan Avenue</ENAMEX> bisects these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> and forms the capital‚Äôs long, wide east‚Äìwest axis. A north‚Äìsouth axis runs <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">8 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 miles</NUMEX>) from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX> of Heaven through the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Forbidden City</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drum</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bell</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">towers</ENAMEX>. Old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX>, once surrounded by massive city walls and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> towering gates, is now encircled by a modern <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">subway</ENAMEX> and a major expressway, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Second Ring Road</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">231‚ÅÑ2 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">141‚ÅÑ2 miles</NUMEX>) around. In turn, a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Third Ring Road</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">48 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">30 miles</NUMEX>) around, encompasses most of urban <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX>, although the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> is bulging outward toward the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fourth</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Fifth Ring</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Forbidden City and Tiananmen Square</ENAMEX>, separated by the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">east‚Äìwest thoroughfare</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Chang‚Äôan Avenue</ENAMEX>, stand at the center of downtown <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX>. They are convenient references for locating the attractions in the north, south, east, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">west districts</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">City Center</ENAMEX>
The center of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> contains <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beijing‚</ENAMEX>Äôs outstanding historical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">site</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Forbidden City</ENAMEX>. Across <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Chang‚Äôan Avenue</ENAMEX> to the south is the capital‚Äôs premier modern <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">site</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Tiananmen Square</ENAMEX>. Just east of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Forbidden City</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beijing‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most important shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wangfujing Dajie</ENAMEX>. These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> places happen to be within walking distance of each other, a rarity for sightseeing in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Forbidden City</ENAMEX>
Completed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Emperor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yongle</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1420</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Forbidden City</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zijin Cheng</ENAMEX>) in the center of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> was the home to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> consecutive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rulers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> during the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ming</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1368‚Äì1644</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Qing</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1644‚Äì1911</ENAMEX>) dynasties. The <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">9-m</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">30-ft</NUMEX>) walls enclose <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">74 hectares</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">183 acres</NUMEX>) of magnificent <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">halls</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palaces</ENAMEX>, courtyards, and imperial gardens, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chambers</ENAMEX> number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly 10,000</NUMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> call the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Forbidden City the Palace Museum</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gu Gong</ENAMEX>), and it is indeed a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> of imperial architecture, artifacts, and private collections of the emperors.
The main entrance is from the south, through the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Gate of Heaven</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Tiananmen</ENAMEX>), the large archway decorated with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mao‚</ENAMEX>Äôs portrait facing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Chang‚Äôan Avenue</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Tiananmen Square</ENAMEX>. The ticket <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">booth</ENAMEX> is due north along a central corridor at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meridian Gate</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wumen</ENAMEX>), where audio tapes can be rented in a variety of languages. Beyond the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meridian Gate</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Outer Court</ENAMEX>, which contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> magnificent ceremonial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">halls</ENAMEX> and their vast courtyards. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meridian Gate</ENAMEX> is connected to the first great <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Gate of Great Harmony</ENAMEX>, which has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> white marble <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridges</ENAMEX>.
The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Outer Court</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hall of Great Harmony</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tai He Dian</ENAMEX>), contains the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">emperor‚Äôs Dragon Throne</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hall of Middle Harmony</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhong He Dian</ENAMEX>), contains a smaller throne, from which emperors addressed their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ministers</ENAMEX>. The final hall of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Outer Court</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hall of Preserving Harmony</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bao He Dian</ENAMEX>), is where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emperors</ENAMEX> received <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China‚</ENAMEX>Äôs best <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> from the annual imperial examinations that determined who would enter the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bureaucracy</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">All three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">halls</ENAMEX> date from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1420</TIMEX> but were renovated or rebuilt under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qing</ENAMEX> emperors.
Between the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Inner</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Outer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX> are the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eastern</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Exhibition Halls</ENAMEX>, requiring a detour to the right as one proceeds north. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hall of Clocks</ENAMEX>, located in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hall of Worshipping Ancestors</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Feng Xian Dian</ENAMEX>), contains the imperial collection of timepieces, many of them <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th-century</TIMEX> gifts from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. Nearby is the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hall of Jewelry</ENAMEX>, housed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Palace of Tranquillity and Longevity</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ning Shou Gong</ENAMEX>), with another display of royal treasures, including robes worn by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Empress Dowager Cixi</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Empress Dowager‚</ENAMEX>Äôs private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">theater</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Emperor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Qianlong‚</ENAMEX>Äôs rock garden, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nine Dragon Screen</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jiu Long Bi</ENAMEX>), a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">30-m</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX>-ft) ceramic mosaic created in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1773</TIMEX>, are also located in this section of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Forbidden City</ENAMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> private pavilions make up the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inner Court</ENAMEX>, located on the central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">axis</ENAMEX> in the northern portion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Forbidden City</ENAMEX>. These <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">halls</ENAMEX> were used as <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residences</ENAMEX> by the emperors and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>. The imperial concubines and eunuchs also lived here, with household <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> often numbering <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 1,000</NUMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pavilion</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Palace of Heavenly Purity</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qian Qing Gong</ENAMEX>), the private <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ming</ENAMEX> emperors. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hall of Union</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jiao Tai Dian</ENAMEX>), which contains the throne of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qing</ENAMEX> empress. The final <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Palace of Earthly Tranquillity</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kun Ning Gong</ENAMEX>), where the last <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emperor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puyi</ENAMEX>, was married as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1922</TIMEX>.
Near the northern gate to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Forbidden City</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Imperial Garden</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yu Hua Yuan</ENAMEX>), filled with small pavilions, ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">cypress trees</ENAMEX>, and complex rookeries, all built during the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Ming Dynasty</ENAMEX>. The final major <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pavilion</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hall of Imperial Peace</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jin An Dian</ENAMEX>), a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Daoist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Xuanwu</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">God of Fire</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Tiananmen Square</ENAMEX>
Occupying <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">40 hectares</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">99 acres</NUMEX>) directly south of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Forbidden City</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Tiananmen Square</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Tiananmen Guangchang</ENAMEX>) is the largest public <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> on earth. This vast expanse did not exist during the time of the emperors, but in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 20th century</TIMEX> it became <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">China‚</ENAMEX>Äôs primary public meeting place for national ceremonies and political demonstrations. It was enlarged to its present size under <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mao Zedong</ENAMEX>. To celebrate the golden anniversary of the founding of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">People‚Äôs Republic</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 October 1949</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Tiananmen Square</ENAMEX> was recently renovated, with granite replacing the old paving blocks.
The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">500-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Qianmen</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Front Gate</ENAMEX>), one of the original <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> gates of the city <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wall</ENAMEX>, still stands at the south end of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Tiananmen Square</ENAMEX> (next to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arrow Tower</ENAMEX>). Most of the other gates fell when the wall was demolished during the modernization of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1958‚Äì1959</NUMEX>. This towering edifice, which houses a photographic exhibition of old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX>, can be climbed for a view of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX>. The imperial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> once passed through here on its annual procession to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX> of Heaven.
Also located on the south side of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Tiananmen Square</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mao Zedong Mausoleum</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mao Zhuxi Jinian Bei</ENAMEX>), opened in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1977</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chairman‚</ENAMEX>Äôs death. Especially popular with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX>, it consists of a reception <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall¬†‚Äî¬†with</ENAMEX> a statue of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Great Helmsman</ENAMEX> seated on his <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúthrone‚Äù¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†and an inner <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mao</ENAMEX> lies in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> in a crystal sarcophagus. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Visitors</ENAMEX> maintain a respectful silence and are quickly ushered through to a gift <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop</ENAMEX> at the back.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monument</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">People‚Äôs Heroes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renmin Yinxiong Jinian Bei</ENAMEX>), on the west side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>, became internationally renowned when it served as the command post for pro-democracy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">demonstrators</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1989</TIMEX> occupation of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Tiananmen</ENAMEX>. The granite obelisk, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">38 m</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">124 ft</ENAMEX>) high, was erected in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1958</TIMEX>. It contains calligraphy carved in the hand of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mao</ENAMEX> and is engraved with stirring scenes of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a century</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">revolutionary</ENAMEX> history.
The massive <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Great Hall of the People</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renmin Dahui Tang</ENAMEX>) borders the west side of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Tiananmen Square</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">nearly 1 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">over half</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a mile</NUMEX>). It opened in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1958</TIMEX> and has served as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">legislative headquarters</ENAMEX> ever since. Whenever the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National People‚Äôs Congress</ENAMEX> is not in session, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Great Hall</ENAMEX> is open to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>, who can enter its banquet <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">halls</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX> reception <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> (one for each <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX>), and glittering main auditorium, which holds <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to 10,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">delegates</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">east</ENAMEX> side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> is home to the large <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard halls</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX>. To the north is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum of the Chinese Revolution</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zhongguo Gemin Lishi Bowuguan</ENAMEX>), with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 10,000</NUMEX> items that document revolutionary politics, most focusing on events in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early</TIMEX> history of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Communist Party</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1919‚Äì1949</ENAMEX>).
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum of Chinese History</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zhongguo Lishi Bowuguan</ENAMEX>), to the south, is of more general interest. It ranks among <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">China‚</ENAMEX>Äôs top <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX> and has the nation‚Äôs largest holdings. Its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300,000</NUMEX> priceless artifacts, displayed on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> levels, are arranged chronologically from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stone Age</ENAMEX> through the final dynasty, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qing</ENAMEX>. Although bereft of up-to-date display cases and featuring explanations written in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> only, this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> provides the most exhaustive overview of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">civilization¬†‚Äî¬†illustrated</ENAMEX> with national treasures¬†‚Äî¬†of any <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">gallery</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>.
Wangfujing Street
Beijing‚Äôs top shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> is also the site of many cultural and historic attractions. <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Wangfujing Street</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wangfujing Dajie</ENAMEX>) begins a few blocks east of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Forbidden City</ENAMEX> and runs north from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Chang‚Äôan Avenue</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beijing Hotel</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beijing Fandian</ENAMEX>) began as the ‚ÄúGrand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hotel de Pekin‚Äù</ENAMEX> under foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1917</TIMEX>, has had several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wings</ENAMEX> added over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the decades</TIMEX>, and is worth strolling through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> as an architectural <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beijing‚</ENAMEX>Äôs evolution in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 20th century</TIMEX>. Wangfujing itself has a long history, serving as the exclusive neighborhood of the well-connected and the rich during the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ming</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qing</ENAMEX> dynasties. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Westerners</ENAMEX> moved to the district in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late-19th century</TIMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> was known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morrison Street</ENAMEX> for a time, after a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">London Times</ENAMEX> correspondent. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tradesmen</ENAMEX> had long done business in the neighborhood‚Äôs tiny attached <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX>, which are <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> filled with an assortment of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, silk <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">art galleries</ENAMEX>, street markets, and modern shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plazas</ENAMEX>.

Across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wangfujing Department Store</ENAMEX> (at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">No. 255</NUMEX>), once <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">China‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most up-to-date emporium but <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> something of an amusing <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">throwback</ENAMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1950s</TIMEX>. Farther up the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beijing‚</ENAMEX>Äôs best stop for book browsers, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Foreign Language Bookstore</ENAMEX> (at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">No. 235</NUMEX>), boasting the capital‚Äôs largest collection of non-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> books and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazines</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cross</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> again to find <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Joseph‚Äôs Catholic Church</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dong Tang</ENAMEX>), the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚ÄúEast Church‚</ENAMEX>Äù that was leveled during the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Boxer Rebellion</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1900</TIMEX>) and immediately rebuilt; it is now open for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> masses (in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> only).
At the north end of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Wangfujing Street</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">China Art Gallery</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zhongguo Meishuguan</ENAMEX>), the national <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">art gallery</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>.

Nearby, at the intersection of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wangfujing</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Chang‚Äôan Avenue</ENAMEX>, is the capital‚Äôs oldest site, the recently unearthed remains of a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20,000-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stone Age</ENAMEX> settlement, complete with human fossils, buffalo bones, and hunting tools. Ironically, it is situated in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">basement</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beijing‚</ENAMEX>Äôs newest attractions: the huge <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Oriental Plaza</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Beijing</ENAMEX>
The neighborhoods north of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Forbidden City</ENAMEX> are the most scenic in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX>, encompassing imperial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX> and lakes, temples and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">towers</ENAMEX>, princely <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansions</ENAMEX>, and some of the city‚Äôs most interesting older neighborhoods.
An atmosphere of imperial leisure is cast by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jingshan Park</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jingshan Gongyuan</ENAMEX>), also called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coal Hill</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meishan</ENAMEX>), rising immediately north of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Forbidden City</ENAMEX>. Jingshan was built by hand from soil dredged out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace moat</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early-15th century</TIMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">A ten-minute</TIMEX> hike to the summit at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Pavilion</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Everlasting Spring</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wanchun Ting</ENAMEX>) is rewarded by the finest view possible of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Forbidden City</ENAMEX> and its golden-tiled <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palaces</ENAMEX>. To the right (west) of the old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Forbidden City</ENAMEX> is a new version, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Zhongnanhai</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">China‚Äôs communist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> are ensconced <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> (strictly off-limits to all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>).
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beihai Park</ENAMEX>
Beijing‚Äôs oldest imperial garden, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beihai Park</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beihai Gongyuan</ENAMEX>), was built on the capital‚Äôs largest lake over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">800 years ago</TIMEX>. Near the south entrance, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Round City</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tuan Cheng</ENAMEX>), is a large ceremonial vessel of green jade presented in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1265</TIMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kublai Khan</ENAMEX>, who built a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> here and entertained <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marco Polo</ENAMEX> on these lake shores in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 13th century</TIMEX>.
Scenic <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hortensia Island</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qionghua Dao</ENAMEX>), built from the soil excavated to create <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beihai‚Äôs lake</ENAMEX>, is crowned by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White Pagoda</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bai Ta</ENAMEX>), one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beijing‚</ENAMEX>Äôs landmarks. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tibetan</ENAMEX> in style, this dagoba commemorates a visit by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dalai Lama</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1651</TIMEX> and measures <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">36 m</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">118 ft</ENAMEX>) in height. At its foot on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Jade Hill</ENAMEX>, to the south, is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yongan Temple</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yongan Si</ENAMEX>), a well-preserved <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Lamaist Buddhist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>. The north shore of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> is bordered by a covered walkway, known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Painted Gallery</ENAMEX>, and a cluster of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qing Dynasty</ENAMEX> imperial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">halls</ENAMEX>. Located here is a traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fangshan</ENAMEX>, founded by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chefs</ENAMEX> who once cooked for the last <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emperor</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Forbidden City</ENAMEX>.
On the western shore of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beihai‚</ENAMEX>Äôs lake are several pavilions and gardens built during the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qing Dynasty</ENAMEX>, including a fine rock and water garden, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hao Pu Jian</ENAMEX>, where the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Empress Dowager Cixi</ENAMEX> listened to music. The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Studio of the Painted Boat</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hua Fang Zhai</ENAMEX>) is another shore <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garden</ENAMEX>, built by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Emperor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Qianlong</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 18th century</TIMEX>, famous for its large square stone <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pool</ENAMEX>. On the northern shore of the lake is the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Studio of the Serene Mind</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jing Xin Zhai</ENAMEX>), a favorite retreat of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China‚Äôs</ENAMEX> last <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emperor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puyi</ENAMEX>. On the eastern shore is a double-sided <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nine Dragon Screen</ENAMEX>, created in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 18th century</TIMEX> from glazed tiles, similar to the more famous version in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Forbidden City</ENAMEX>.
The pavilions, pagodas, and rookeries on the northeast shore are known collectively as the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gardens Within Gardens</ENAMEX>, where the imperial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> once enjoyed the lake. Its most arresting site is Little Western Heaven (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Xiao Xi Tian</ENAMEX>), which consists of a square pagoda and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">towers</ENAMEX>, erected as a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrine</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Goddess of Mercy</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guanyin</ENAMEX>) in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1770</TIMEX>. Tour <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> depart the eastern shore from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Five Dragons Pavilion</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hortensia Island</ENAMEX>.
Today, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beihai</ENAMEX> lake is no longer restricted to the imperial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX>, and it is the most popular spot in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> to rent a rowboat in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX> or to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX>-skate in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the winter</TIMEX>.
Back <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lakes</ENAMEX> and Hutongs
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central Beijing‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> front lakes, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nanhai, Zhonghai</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beihai</ENAMEX>, run along the west side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Forbidden City</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Chang‚Äôan Avenue</ENAMEX> north to where they connect with the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Back Lakes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shi Sha Hai</ENAMEX>), known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qianhai, Houhai</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xihai</ENAMEX>. These lakes once comprised the route used to ship <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">grain</ENAMEX> and luxuries via the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Grand Canal</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Forbidden City</ENAMEX>. Later, this was the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">waterway</ENAMEX> employed by imperial <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">barges</ENAMEX> when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emperor</ENAMEX> desired an outing. These interconnected lakes are marvelous places to stroll. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Back Lakes District</ENAMEX> contains many landmarks of old <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Beijing¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†from princely <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansions</ENAMEX> to old temples and gardens¬†‚Äî¬†but it is best known for its colorful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alleyways</ENAMEX> and traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard houses</ENAMEX>.
At the northern tip of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Back Lakes</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Huifeng Temple</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Huifeng Si</ENAMEX>). Perched on a tiny rocky isle in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Xihai Lake</ENAMEX>, it is a wonderful spot for a lake view and a picnic. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">East</ENAMEX> of this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX>, on the north side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Second Ring Road</ENAMEX>, is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deshengmen Arrow Tower</ENAMEX>, a gate and archers‚Äô <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ming Dynasty</ENAMEX> that survived the demolition of the great city <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wall</ENAMEX>. Inside is a small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> devoted to the history of the local hutong neighborhoods. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">gate‚Äôs courtyard</ENAMEX> are a coin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> and antiques market.
On the eastern shore of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Houhai Lake</ENAMEX>, the middle of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Back Lakes</ENAMEX>, is the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Soong Ching-ling Residence</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Song Ching Ling Guzhu</ENAMEX>), where the famous Soong <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> who married <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sun Yat-sen</ENAMEX> lived from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1963</TIMEX> until her death in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1981</TIMEX>. Her estate and its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">200-year-old</TIMEX> classical garden are now a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>, filled with photographs and heirlooms of her remarkable life. On the same lake shore is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guanghua Temple</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guanghua Si</ENAMEX>), a small <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> that has returned to life after being severely damaged by rampaging <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Red Guards</ENAMEX> during the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Cultural Revolution</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1966‚Äì1976</ENAMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Nearly two dozen</NUMEX> monks reside here.
A few blocks east of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guanghau Temple</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beijing‚</ENAMEX>Äôs historic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Drum Tower</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gu Lou) and Bell Tower</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhong Lou</ENAMEX>). Both can be climbed for splendid views of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Back Lakes District</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Drum Tower</ENAMEX> (open <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9am‚Äì4:30pm</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX>; free) is the more interesting of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>. The capital‚Äôs first <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Drum Tower</ENAMEX>, from which the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> were signaled with drums, was built here by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kublai Khan</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1272</TIMEX>, rebuilt by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ming Emperor Yongle</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1420</TIMEX>, and renovated under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qing</ENAMEX> emperors. A side stairway leads to the balcony, where one of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> original watch drums remains, along with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">what‚Äôs</ENAMEX> claimed to be the world‚Äôs largest drum (made in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX>).
Qianhai, the most southern of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Back Lakes</ENAMEX>, connects to the lake in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beihai Park</ENAMEX>. It is famous for its views of the Western <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hills</ENAMEX>. Under the willow <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> on its western shore, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendors</ENAMEX> set up an enormous outdoor market (known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lotus Flower Market</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lianghua Shichang</ENAMEX>), which sells <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hosts</ENAMEX> amateur <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> opera <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">singers</ENAMEX> in the evenings.
On the west side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Back Lakes</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prince</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gong‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Mansion</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gong Wang Fu</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beijing‚</ENAMEX>Äôs best-preserved example of an imperial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansion</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prince Gong</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> to an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emperor</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China‚Äôs</ENAMEX> last <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emperor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puyi</ENAMEX>, occupied this estate in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-19th century</TIMEX>, making use of its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">halls</ENAMEX> and pavilions as his private <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX>. The estate contains numerous courtyards, arched <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridges</ENAMEX>, ponds, rock gardens, and its own pagoda.
The neighborhoods of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Back Lakes District</ENAMEX> are filled with the hutongs (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">alleys</ENAMEX>) and siheyuans (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard houses</ENAMEX>) that were characteristic of urban <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> during the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ming</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qing</ENAMEX> dynasties. They are common even <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly half</NUMEX> of the capital‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> living in some form of rectangular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard compound</ENAMEX>. Nevertheless, hutongs and siheyuans are endangered symbols of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Beijing‚Äôs</ENAMEX> past, constantly under threat of urban renewal. Fewer than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard dwellings</ENAMEX> are preserved in cultural protection zones. Although it would have once been occupied by a single rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> (plus <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">servants</ENAMEX>), a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard house</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> is shared by many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>.
The hutongs can be toured on your <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">own¬†‚Äî¬†on</ENAMEX> foot, by rented <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bicycle</ENAMEX>, or by hiring one of the canopied pedicabs in the area. But most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> prefer a guided tour. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beijing Hutong Tourist Agency</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tel</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6615-9097</TIMEX>), which books tours through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX> desks, has a fleet of red-canopied pedicabs led by an English-speaking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guide</ENAMEX>. Its hutong tour combines many of the sights in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Back Lakes District</ENAMEX> with the opportunity to step inside a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard house</ENAMEX> and talk with its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">modern-day</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lama Temple</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Confucius Temple</ENAMEX>
Beijing‚Äôs most popular <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lama Temple</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yong He Gong</ENAMEX>). Built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1694</TIMEX> for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prince</ENAMEX> who became the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Emperor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yongzheng</ENAMEX>, it was converted to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1744</TIMEX>. Under the reign of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qianlong</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> served as the chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">center</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tibetan Buddhism</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Yellow Hat sect</ENAMEX>) outside of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lhasa</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lama Temple</ENAMEX> is large and ornate, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 200</NUMEX> monks in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>.
Its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> central worship <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">halls</ENAMEX> are spacious. Between the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">halls</ENAMEX> is the capital‚Äôs oldest incense burner (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1747</TIMEX>). The throne of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dalai Lama</ENAMEX> is in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">worship hall</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Falun Dian</ENAMEX>). The final hall contains the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lama Temple‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most revered statue, a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">23-m</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">75</NUMEX>-ft) image of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buddha</ENAMEX> carved from a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Tibetan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">sandalwood tree</ENAMEX>, its head peeking out of the pavilion‚Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> story. The side <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">halls</ENAMEX> have large collections of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cast</ENAMEX> and carved <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX> figures, including many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Tantric</ENAMEX> statues whose more explicit features are discreetly draped in colorful silk scarves.
Across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> from the usually packed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lama Temple</ENAMEX> is the serene <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Confucius Temple</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kong Miao</ENAMEX>), the largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shrine</ENAMEX> to the great philosopher outside of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Confucius‚</ENAMEX>Äô <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">hometown</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Qu Fu</ENAMEX>. Built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1306</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> was long part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Imperial College</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guozi Jian</ENAMEX>), and its courtyards teem with scores of carved stone tablets honoring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> who passed the nationwide civil service examinations from the time of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kublai Khan</ENAMEX>.
The most interesting display is located in the long side <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> on the eastern wall. It is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> history that furnishes a comprehensive overview, with signs in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX>. In another <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Confucius Temple</ENAMEX> is a complete edition of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Confucian</ENAMEX> classics carved in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stone</ENAMEX>. Near the entrance of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> (just inside the main gate) is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Donald Sussman Center for Chinese Antiquities</ENAMEX>, opened in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>. At the north end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> there is a statue of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Confucius</ENAMEX> and a collection of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th-century</TIMEX> stone drums used in <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Confucian</ENAMEX> ceremonies.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Beijing</ENAMEX>
Few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> venture into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xuanwu</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chongwen</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">districts</ENAMEX> south of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Chang‚Äôan Avenue</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Tiananmen Square</ENAMEX> except to visit the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX> of Heaven and perhaps to walk along the charming <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Liulichang Culture Street</ENAMEX>. But there are other sights of interest.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Foreign Legation</ENAMEX>, where foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> maintained their own autonomous <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">quarter</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">from 1860 to 1937</TIMEX>, lies east of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Tiananmen Square</ENAMEX>. No longer the location of the diplomatic compounds in the capital, this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">district</ENAMEX> still contains many former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">embassies</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clubs</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">barracks</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX>, and commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>, most now converted to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutes</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>. The architecture is fascinating. Located along <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Taijichang Dajie</ENAMEX> (the former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Customs Street</ENAMEX>), directly south of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dongchang‚Äôan Jie</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Chang‚Äôan Avenue East</ENAMEX>), are the old <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Austrian</ENAMEX> Legation (now the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institute of International Studies</ENAMEX>), the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> Legation (now the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">People‚Äôs Association</ENAMEX> for Friendship with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Foreign Countries</ENAMEX>), the private <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Peking Club</ENAMEX> (now the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beijing People‚Äôs Congress</ENAMEX>), and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Legation</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">French Barracks</ENAMEX> (now the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chinese Workers Union</ENAMEX>).
Westward along <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Jiaominxiang</ENAMEX> toward <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Tiananmen Square</ENAMEX> are the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">neo-Gothic St. Michael‚Äôs Church</ENAMEX>, built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1902</TIMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> and still active. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">You‚Äôll</ENAMEX> also find the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">German Hospital</ENAMEX> (now the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beijing Hospital</ENAMEX>) here, and the former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">embassies</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Holland</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North</ENAMEX> up <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhengyi Lu</ENAMEX> (the former <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Canal Street</ENAMEX>) back toward <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Chang‚Äôan Avenue</ENAMEX> are the former <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> Legation (now the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Beijing Mayor‚Äôs office</ENAMEX>) and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Legation</ENAMEX>, once the largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Western</ENAMEX> stronghold in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> (occupied from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1860 to 1959</TIMEX>), now the stronghold of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> security services.

The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chongwen District</ENAMEX> of southeast <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> popular attractions. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Panjiayuan</ENAMEX> (known variously as the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dirt Market or Ghost Market</ENAMEX>) is the capital‚Äôs top open-air market for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antiques</ENAMEX> and curios, best visited as early as possible on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">mornings</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Natural History Museum</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ziran Bowuguan</ENAMEX>) has China‚Äôs best display of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dinosaur skeletons</ENAMEX>. It is located near south <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing‚</ENAMEX>Äôs leading attraction, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX> of Heaven (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tiantan</ENAMEX>).
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX> of Heaven
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX> of Heaven (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tiantan</ENAMEX>), built under <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ming Emperor Yongle</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1420</TIMEX> as a site for sacred rites, is located directly south of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Forbidden City</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> the site is called the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Heaven Park</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tiantan Gongyuan</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emperor</ENAMEX> would lead a procession from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> to the altar here to perform the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> rites and sacrifices to heaven. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most remarkable architectural works survives from that era of imperial ritual, the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Hall of Prayer for Good Harvests</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Qinian Dian</ENAMEX>), a circular hall with blue-tiled roofs capped by a golden sphere. The entire <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrine</ENAMEX> was constructed without nails or cross beams, its magnificent arched ceiling supported by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX> carved pillars. This <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX> survived until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1889</TIMEX>, when lightning burned it to the ground, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reconstruction</ENAMEX> is superb, and the round <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX> has become an emblem of imperial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX>. Unfortunately, its ornate interior can only be glimpsed from outside, since <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> are no longer allowed within.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> other important monuments survive in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tiantan Park</ENAMEX>, both located on the axis running south from the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Hall of Prayer for Good Harvests</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Imperial Vault of Heaven</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Huang Qiong Yu</ENAMEX>), built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1530</TIMEX>, resembles the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hall of Prayer</ENAMEX>; stone tablets used in the winter solstice rituals were once stored here. It is surrounded by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Echo Wall</ENAMEX>, into which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> attempt to whisper messages that can be heard by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> at distant points along the wall. The southernmost monument is the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Circular Altar</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yuan Qiu</ENAMEX>), an open platform dating from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1530</TIMEX> where silk was once burned as a sacrifice to the heavenly powers. Its acoustics are said to allow orations to be broadcast for <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">miles</NUMEX> in all directions.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Heaven Park</ENAMEX> is an excellent place to take a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> stroll. It‚Äôs popular with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locals</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> seeking a quiet bench for reading and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> performing their <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> tai chi exercises.
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Liulichang Culture Street</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Dazhalan Mall</ENAMEX>
The flavor of the old capital‚Äôs commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">districts</ENAMEX> is best preserved along <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Liulichang Culture Street</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Liulichang Xijie</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Liulichang Dongjie</ENAMEX>) and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Dazhalan Mall</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dazhalan Jie</ENAMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">conjoined avenues</ENAMEX> south of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Tiananmen Square</ENAMEX> that run east-to-west for <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">over 11‚ÅÑ2 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 mile</NUMEX>).
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Liulichang Culture Street</ENAMEX>, the shopping haunt of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX> and antiques fanciers since the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Ming Dynasty</ENAMEX>, was restored in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1980s</TIMEX>. Its tile-roofed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> sell curios, antiques, traditional art supplies, scrolls, paintings, prints, and old books. Among its renowned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rongbaozhai</ENAMEX> (art and art supplies), the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">China Bookstore</ENAMEX> (old books), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jijuge</ENAMEX> (a teahouse featuring clay figures from tombs), and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wenshenzhai</ENAMEX> (former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">purveyor</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fans</ENAMEX> and paper lanterns to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qing Dynasty</ENAMEX>).
Liulichang merges with <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Dazhalan Mall</ENAMEX>, a cobblestone <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> closed to motor traffic that offers still more window-shopping: historic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">outlets</ENAMEX> for traditional herbal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicines</ENAMEX>, shoes, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pickles</ENAMEX>, and silk fabric and clothing. The east end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dazhalan</ENAMEX> pedestrian <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mall</ENAMEX> is intersected by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhubaoshi Jie</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Jewelry Street</ENAMEX>), once the major theater and brothel district of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> and now the site of a lively <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sidewalk bazaar</ENAMEX>. Zhubaoshi Street connects <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dazhalan</ENAMEX> directly to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qianmen</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Tiananmen Square</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East Beijing</ENAMEX>

Here <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Chang‚Äôan Avenue</ENAMEX> changes its name to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jianguomenwai Dajie</ENAMEX>, the location of some of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China‚</ENAMEX>Äôs finest international <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beijing‚</ENAMEX>Äôs best shopping opportunities. The same can be said for the northeast section of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Third Ring Road</ENAMEX>, where major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> and shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plazas</ENAMEX> are also concentrated, along with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China‚Äôs first Hard Rock Cafe</ENAMEX>. Located between these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> stretches is the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Sanlitun Diplomatic Compound</ENAMEX>, which has the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">capital‚Äôs liveliest nightlife</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, caf√©s, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX>, and historic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">east Beijing</ENAMEX> attract <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of international <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX> and after dark.

Once celebrated for its silks and bargain prices, the crowded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Silk Alley</ENAMEX> stalls are now filled with name-brand, logo, and knockoff <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designer</ENAMEX> sportswear. Running north for several blocks from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jianguomenwai Dajie, Silk Alley</ENAMEX> is a lively bazaar requiring abundant bargaining and haggling skills; there are no set prices. The market leads into a quiet, modern foreign diplomatic <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">quarter</TIMEX>, home to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">embassies</ENAMEX> including those of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ireland</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX>.
Just north of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Silk Alley</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Friendship Store</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ritan Park</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ritan Gongyuan</ENAMEX>), location in imperial <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Altar</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sun</ENAMEX>. The altar¬†‚Äî¬†where the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emperor</ENAMEX> performed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">rites¬†‚Äî¬†was erected</ENAMEX> on a hill in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1530</TIMEX> and is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> crowned by a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pavilion</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Ritan Park</ENAMEX> contains a serene rock garden and fishing pond in its southwest corner.

Sanlitun
Located in the heart of a large foreign diplomatic district between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dongzhimenwai Dajie</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Liangma River</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sanlitun</ENAMEX> has become the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nightlife district</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX>. Many of its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> or more small <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">caf√©s¬†‚Äî¬†offering international cuisine</ENAMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX> and drinking and music by <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">night¬†‚Äî¬†are</ENAMEX> located on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sanlitun Lu</ENAMEX>, which has been officially named <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sanlitun Bar Street</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sanlitun Jiuba Jie</ENAMEX>). Many of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beijing‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expatriates</ENAMEX> and foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX>, as well as the city‚Äôs younger <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX>, gather here <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each summer</TIMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sidewalk</ENAMEX> drinking, dining, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>-watching. On the west side of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sanlitun Lu</ENAMEX> there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> open-air markets, one selling rattan furniture and bamboo crafts, the other offering Western-style <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designer</ENAMEX>-label clothing.
Sanlitun caf√©s and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX> now stretch southeast of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sanlitun Lu</ENAMEX> down a small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lane</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dongdaqiao Xie Jie</ENAMEX>. This leads to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Workers‚Äô Stadium</ENAMEX> area and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beijing‚</ENAMEX>Äôs oldest expatriate American-style <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">grill, Frank‚Äôs Place</ENAMEX>. While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sanlitun</ENAMEX> is devoid of historic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX>, it stands out as modern <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Beijing‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most international neighborhood.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Beijing</ENAMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beijing‚</ENAMEX>Äôs top attractions, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Summer Palace</ENAMEX> and the Western <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hills</ENAMEX>, are located northwest of the capital‚Äôs relentless urban sprawl. This is the beautiful, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">hilly</NUMEX> countryside of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Haidian District</ENAMEX> (home to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China‚</ENAMEX>Äôs top <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">universities</ENAMEX> and computer technology <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">developers</ENAMEX>). And closer to city <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>, the western <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">precincts</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> are the site of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> major temples, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beijing Art Museum</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Beijing Zoo</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Summer Palace</ENAMEX>
The site of imperial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palaces</ENAMEX> since the reign of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kublai Khan</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Summer Palace</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yi He Yuan</ENAMEX>) achieved its present form during reconstructions from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1749 to 1764</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Emperor Qianlong</ENAMEX> saw to the expansion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>, its hills, and its lake, and he added pavilions and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">halls</ENAMEX> that stand <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>. The imperial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> used the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Summer Palace</ENAMEX> as its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> home, escaping the heat of central <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Forbidden City</ENAMEX>. Today, it is the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">playground</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locals</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> alike. Many say it is the most beautiful imperial garden in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">China¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†a large-scale garden equivalent to a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> or estate.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Summer Palace</ENAMEX> was twice destroyed after its expansion under the early <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Qing</ENAMEX> emperors. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1860</TIMEX>, during the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Opium War</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> invaded <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> and ransacked and ruined many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Empress Dowager Cixi</ENAMEX> saw to a complete restoration in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1886</TIMEX>, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Western</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">armies</ENAMEX> returned in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1900</TIMEX> in retaliation for the siege of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Foreign Legation</ENAMEX> during the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Boxer Rebellion</ENAMEX>. Undaunted, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Empress Dowager</ENAMEX> completed a second restoration in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1903</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Summer Palace</ENAMEX> became her countryside version of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Forbidden City</ENAMEX>, her <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX> of choice even when the heat of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> diminished. Like the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Forbidden City</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Summer Palace</ENAMEX> was opened to the public in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1925</TIMEX>.
The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">280</NUMEX>-hectare (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">700-acre</NUMEX>) Summer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palace</ENAMEX> is dominated by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kunming Lake</ENAMEX>, which itself is subdivided into <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Lake</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Lake</ENAMEX> by several causeways. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Longevity Hill</ENAMEX> rises above the north shore. Behind its peaks is a version of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing‚Äôs Back Lakes</ENAMEX>, created during the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qing Dynasty</ENAMEX>. The main strolling area is along the north shore of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kunming Lake</ENAMEX>, where the pavilions and courtyards are linked by the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Long Corridor</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chang Lang</ENAMEX>). This covered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">promenade</ENAMEX> stretches <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">777 m</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2,550 ft</NUMEX>) from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eastern Halls west</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Marble Boat</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX> built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1750</TIMEX>, it consists of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">273</NUMEX> crossbeam sections and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> pavilions. Nearly every exposed portion of its beams, panels, and pillars is decorated with a painted scene from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> myth, history, literature, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">geography¬†‚Äî¬†10,000</NUMEX> brightly painted panels in all.
Among the important imperial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> on the east side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Long Corridor</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> are worth viewing. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hall of Benevolent Longevity</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Renshou Dian</ENAMEX>) is where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Empress Dowager Cixi</ENAMEX> received court <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> from her <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dragon Throne</ENAMEX> (which is still in place). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hall of Jade</ENAMEX> Ripples (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yulan Dian</ENAMEX>) is where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cixi</ENAMEX> confined her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nephew</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Emperor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guangxu</ENAMEX>, while she ruled in his place. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hall</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cultivating Happiness</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yile Dian</ENAMEX>) served as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Empress Dowager‚</ENAMEX>Äôs private viewing box for performances in the adjacent <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-story <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">theater</ENAMEX>, which was built to honor her <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">60th</NUMEX> birthday. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cixi</ENAMEX> celebrated many of her birthdays at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Summer Palace</ENAMEX>, and she was especially fond of theatrical performances, in which she sometimes played a role. This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">theater</ENAMEX> now contains some of her imperial garments, jewelry, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cosmetics</ENAMEX>, as well as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mercedes-Benz</ENAMEX> said to be the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> passenger <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Long Corridor</ENAMEX> begins at a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Qing building</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hall of Happiness and Longevity</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leshou Tang</ENAMEX>), where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Empress Dowager</ENAMEX> slept. The curtained bed, the lamps, and most of the furniture are original.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Midway</ENAMEX> along the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Long Corridor</ENAMEX> at the foot of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Longevity Hill</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hall of Dispelling Clouds</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pai Yun Dian</ENAMEX>), where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cixi</ENAMEX> held her birthday parties. This <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX> now houses a collection of birthday gifts, including the portrait of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Empress Dowager</ENAMEX> painted by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Holland‚Äôs Hubert Vos</ENAMEX> upon the occasion of her <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">70th</NUMEX> birthday in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1905</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Long Corridor</ENAMEX> ends at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Pavilion</ENAMEX> for Listening to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Orioles</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tingli Guan</ENAMEX>), where there is now a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX> serving <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Qing</ENAMEX> dynasty imperial dishes.
Just beyond this point is the most famous (or perhaps notorious) monument in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Summer Palace</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Marble Boat</ENAMEX>, known officially as the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Boat of Purity and Ease</ENAMEX>. To <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beijingers</ENAMEX>, it is <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">China‚Äôs ‚Äúship</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fools</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù Rebuilt</ENAMEX> with lavish <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">materials</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stone</ENAMEX> and stained glass) by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Empress Dowager</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1893</TIMEX>, this <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">36-m</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">118-ft</ENAMEX>) statue of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> was restored (it is said) with funds meant to shore up China‚Äôs woeful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">navy</ENAMEX>, but it was not long before <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> completely humiliated <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> in battles at sea. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cixi</ENAMEX> has been blamed ever since for her profligate and selfish ways, combined with her <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Machiavellian</ENAMEX> rise from concubine to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Empress</ENAMEX>, popularly held to be the cause of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China‚</ENAMEX>Äôs weakness and the fall of the last dynasty. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Summer Palace</ENAMEX> remains as visible testimony to the extravagance of the late <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qing Dynasty</ENAMEX> at the expense of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China‚</ENAMEX>Äôs freedom and prosperity at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the beginning of the 20th century</TIMEX>.
While many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX> doubt that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Empress Dowager Cixi</ENAMEX> played such a villainous role, her Summer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palace</ENAMEX> is undoubtedly lavish enough to have launched countless tales of luxury and decadence. Even <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> the view of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Longevity Hill</ENAMEX> and its scores of tile-roofed pavilions and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">towers</ENAMEX>, enjoyed from a pleasure barge drifting across <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lake Kunming</ENAMEX>, is a scene from a dream of old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> in which emperors and empresses led lives in gardens of unimaginable splendor. Here even the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bridges¬†‚Äî¬†connecting lake isles</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace shores¬†‚Äî¬†wouldn‚Äôt</ENAMEX> be out of place in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ming</ENAMEX> or Qing scroll painting, particularly the celebrated <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Seventeen-Arch Bridge</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shiqi Kong Qiao</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">150 m</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">492 ft</ENAMEX>) long and built of white marble.
Not far from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Summer Palace</ENAMEX> is the site of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Old Summer Palace</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yuan Ming Yuan</ENAMEX>). When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Emperor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kangxi</ENAMEX> built this imperial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 18th century</TIMEX>, it had no equal. However, after its destruction in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1860</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX>, it was left to decay, and the court‚Äôs attention turned to restoring the new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Summer Palace</ENAMEX>. All that‚Äôs left now in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Old Summer Palace</ENAMEX> are some of the most haunting ruins in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>, particularly in a section known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Garden of Eternal Spring</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Changchun Yuan</ENAMEX>), where <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX>-style <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">halls</ENAMEX>, marble fountains, mazes, and a concert <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stand</ENAMEX> are now a broken jumble of ornately carved columns and arches. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Every few years</TIMEX> there are fresh announcements that the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Old Summer Palace</ENAMEX> will be restored to its former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">glories</ENAMEX>. For now, it provides a quiet picnic grounds amidst the ruins of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Western Hills</ENAMEX>
When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">China‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rulers</ENAMEX> really wanted to escape the heat of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, they went farther west than the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Summer Palace</ENAMEX> to the Western <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hills</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Xi Shan</ENAMEX>), romantically known <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fragrant Hills Park</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xiangshan Gong</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">yuan</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Imperial</ENAMEX> villas first dotted these hillsides¬†‚Äî¬<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">†27 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">17 miles</NUMEX>) from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Beijing¬†‚Äî¬†more</ENAMEX> than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">800 years ago</TIMEX>. But it was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Emperor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Qianlong</ENAMEX> who converted the Western <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hills</ENAMEX> into a formal mountain retreat for the enjoyment of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX>, complete with its own temples, lakes, gardens, and even a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">zoo</ENAMEX>. Late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">autumn</TIMEX> is the favorite season for <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these days</TIMEX>, when leaves turn a fiery red. However, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locals</ENAMEX> as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> come to the Western <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hills</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> round for the natural beauty and historic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> renowned <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">temples</ENAMEX> still survive in the Western <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hills</ENAMEX>. Near the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">park‚Äôs</NUMEX> north gate are the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> great <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">halls</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sleeping Buddha</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wo Fo Si</ENAMEX>). In the final <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wo Fo Dian</ENAMEX>) there is a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5-m</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>-ft) lacquered statue of the reclining <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buddha</ENAMEX> (dated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1321</TIMEX>) about to attain nirvana.
Inside the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">park‚Äôs</NUMEX> north gate is an even larger <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Azure Clouds</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Biyun Si</ENAMEX>), which ascends the hillside. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sun Yat-sen</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX> of the modern <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chinese Republic</ENAMEX>, once lay in state here before removal to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nanjing</ENAMEX>; his hat, coat, and coffin are still at this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX>. So, too, is the fascinating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Luohan Hall</ENAMEX>. Luohans are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">followers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buddha</ENAMEX> who achieve enlightenment but choose to stay on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX> to show others the way. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> luohans portrayed in this temple‚Äôs carved figures range from the ecstatic to the gruesome, from the common to the surreal. Topping the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diamond Throne Pagoda</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jinggang Baozuo Ta</ENAMEX>), built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1748</TIMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> style, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> pagodas and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> stupas surrounding a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">35-m</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">115-ft</ENAMEX>) white pagoda.
The most popular site in the Western <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hills</ENAMEX> is natural: a summit known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Incense Burner Peak</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Xiang Lu Feng</ENAMEX>), named for the image created when fog comes sweeping over it. There is a winding path to the top known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gui Jian Chou</ENAMEX> (‚ÄúEven the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Devil</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Terrified‚Äù</ENAMEX>) as well as a chair lift (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20 minutes</TIMEX> each way). At the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">557-m</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,827</NUMEX>-ft) summit there are pavilions, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendors</ENAMEX>, and small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">paths</ENAMEX> into surrounding forests. There are also fine views of the lakes, temples, pavilions, and pagodas below, which can be explored upon return. On a clear day, one is tempted to linger. Here, there‚Äôs an emperor‚Äôs view to the southeast, commanding both the pavilions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Summer Palace</ENAMEX> and the skyscrapers of downtown <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White Cloud Temple</ENAMEX>
Beijing‚Äôs most active <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Daoist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Bai Yun Guan</ENAMEX>, is better known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White Cloud Temple</ENAMEX>. This is also the capital‚Äôs most fascinating religious <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">site</ENAMEX>, a place of superstition and incense, mystery and spirited worship. As <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China‚</ENAMEX>Äôs leading indigenous religion, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Daoism</ENAMEX> differs from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buddhism</ENAMEX> (transplanted from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>) not so much in the architecture of its temples and the art of its statuary (these are often quite similar in style) as in its practices and beliefs. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daoism</ENAMEX> emphasized nature, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Way</ENAMEX>, but in its organized form it relies on a huge <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">pantheon of gods</ENAMEX>, goddesses, and supernatural icons promising miracles.
At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baiyunguan</ENAMEX> the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX> features the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Wind Containing Bridge</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> attempt to ensure their good fortune by striking a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17th-century</TIMEX> copper bell with coins. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Spring Hall for the Jade Emperor</ENAMEX>, worshippers touch the golden feet of statues representing the gods of wealth. In the side <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">halls</ENAMEX> there are <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrines</ENAMEX> where the devout can appeal to the proper god to cure eye problems, ensure the birth of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX>, pass an examination, get a good job, and increase longevity. Every <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of these ‚Äúwishing halls‚Äù is usually jammed with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locals</ENAMEX>, who are often dressed in their most expensive clothes for the tour. Festivals on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> and fifteenth of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">lunar month</TIMEX> are especially lively times to visit. At the rear of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> there is a large rock garden, a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">classrooms</ENAMEX> where many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">novice monks</ENAMEX> are trained in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Daoism</ENAMEX>.
Baiyunguan was founded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">739</TIMEX> and received its present name in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1394</TIMEX>. Most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">halls</ENAMEX> date from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qing Dynasty</ENAMEX>, although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yuanchen Hall</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> try to locate the deity on the zodiac of their birthday, dates from the time of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kublai Khan</ENAMEX>. Just south of this temple <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tianning Si Ta</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple of Heavenly Tranquillity Pagoda</ENAMEX>, built during the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Liao Dynasty</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">907‚Äì1125</ENAMEX>), making it <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Beijing‚</ENAMEX>Äôs oldest surviving <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>-story <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">58 m</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">190 ft</ENAMEX>) high and is decorated with fine <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX> carvings.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White Pagoda Temple</ENAMEX>
Extensively renovated and enlarged in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White Pagoda Temple</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bai Ta Si</ENAMEX>) is renowned for its <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tibetan</ENAMEX>-style pagoda (usually called a dagoba or stupa). The white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pagoda</ENAMEX> at this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> is larger than the more famous <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beihai Park</ENAMEX>. In fact, it is the largest of its type in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>, built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1279</TIMEX> during the reign of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kublai Khan</ENAMEX>.
The main gate of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White Pagoda Temple</ENAMEX> (located on the north side of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fuchingmennei Dajie</ENAMEX>), the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> are new. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum houses</ENAMEX> many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX> artifacts and statues discovered on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> grounds, as well as a sutra copied out by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Emperor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Qianlong</ENAMEX>. This rare manuscript, unearthed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1978</TIMEX>, was composed in the emperor‚Äôs own hand in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1753</TIMEX>. Beyond the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> to the north are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> finely restored prayer <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">halls</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hall of the Great Enlightened Ones</ENAMEX> is stuffed with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of little <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buddhas</ENAMEX>. The white pagoda itself, rising <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">51 m</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">167 ft</ENAMEX>), is last and, like most dagobas, remains sealed, its holy treasures and relics somewhere beneath or inside the imposing structure.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pagoda Temple</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Beijing Zoo</ENAMEX>, across the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nanchang River</ENAMEX>, is one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beijing‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most beautiful sights, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Five Pagoda Temple</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wu Ta Si</ENAMEX>). Its singular main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX> consists of a square stone building <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">71‚ÅÑ2 m</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> ft) high, its outside walls decorated with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one thousand</NUMEX> niches, each containing an engraved <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buddha</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX> is crowned with a cluster of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> elaborate towering pagodas, with stairs inside leading up to a view from the roof. The <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">five-pagoda</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> is more <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> than <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> in style. It was built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1473</TIMEX>, during the early <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Ming Dynasty</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> was originally part of the larger <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Zhengjue Temple</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> (built during the reign of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ming Emperor Yongle</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1420s</TIMEX> and sacked by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Western</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1860 and 1900</TIMEX>). On the same grounds today is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beijing Stone Engraving Art Museum</ENAMEX>, an open-air display of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 500</NUMEX> ancient stone <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">carvings</ENAMEX> and inscribed stone pillars.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Bell Temple</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Bell Temple</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Da Zhong Si</ENAMEX>) received its apt name in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1743</TIMEX>, when the largest bronze bell in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> was placed here. This huge bell, weighing <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">34,000 kg</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">46 tons</NUMEX>) and measuring <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX> ft) high, was <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cast</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1420</TIMEX>, just as the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Forbidden City</ENAMEX> was finished. It is on display in its own <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pavilion</ENAMEX> at the rear of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Bell Temple</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Locals</ENAMEX> often climb the stairs to the top of the big bell and drop coins through an opening for good luck, a ritual that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of pilgrims in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past</TIMEX> followed.
Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1980s</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Bell Temple</ENAMEX> has served as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China‚</ENAMEX>Äôs bell <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 700</NUMEX> bells in its collection. A few of the bells are modern (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cast</ENAMEX> to commemorate recent events), and some are from foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>, but most are <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> antiquities. Among the bells displayed in the various <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">halls</ENAMEX> and pavilions are some that are <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4,000 years old</TIMEX>. For a small fee, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> can sound a set of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stone chimes</ENAMEX> that date from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Warring States Period</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">475‚Äì221 b.c.</ENAMEX>).
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Art Museum</ENAMEX>
Doubling as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beijing Art Museum</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zhongguo Meishuguan</ENAMEX>) is housed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">halls</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wanshou Temple</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Temple of Longevity</ENAMEX>. Although the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX>, renovated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1761</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Emperor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Qianlong</ENAMEX>, is no longer active, it contains many old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX>, including the bell and drum <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">towers</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX>, which date from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1577</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Empress Dowager Cixi</ENAMEX> used to lodge overnight in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> on her voyage by royal <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">barge</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Forbidden City</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Summer Palace</ENAMEX>. The large meditation <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX> at the center of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">temple complex</ENAMEX> is now an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">art gallery</ENAMEX> containing modern <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> oil paintings. Side <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">halls</ENAMEX> feature other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">art</ENAMEX> exhibits, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ceramics</ENAMEX>, historic relics, and artworks and crafts for sale.
At the rear of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wanshou Temple</ENAMEX> is a large rock garden with shrines to the gods of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buddhism‚</ENAMEX>Äôs sacred mountains in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pavilions</ENAMEX> built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1761</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> housing a stone tablet with the engraved signature of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Emperor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Qianlong</ENAMEX>), and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> arched gates constructed in the style of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing Zoo</ENAMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Beijing Zoo</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beijing Dongwu Yuan</ENAMEX>) is the creation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Empress Dowager Cixi</ENAMEX>, who in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1908</TIMEX> converted this private <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Ming Dynasty</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garden estate</ENAMEX> into a preserve for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 700</NUMEX> exotic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> imported from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>. The entrance gate dates from the late <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qing Dynasty</ENAMEX>, and many of the exhibition <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">halls</ENAMEX> seem nearly as old. Even the outdoor pens seem quite dated. With <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 6,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">zoo</ENAMEX> is the largest in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>, but despite its notable collection of giant pandas, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Siberian tigers</ENAMEX>, golden <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkeys</ENAMEX>, and red-crowned cranes, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> is in need of modernization. Few foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> are happy with the size and condition of the cages, although the new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Panda Garden</ENAMEX>, featuring a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half-dozen</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult pandas</ENAMEX> and twin <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">babies</ENAMEX>, is a bit more spacious and a step in the right direction. Most of the zoo‚Äôs recent major funding has gone to the creation of the adjacent <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Beijing Aquarium</ENAMEX>, a state-of-the-art marine <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> scheduled to have <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50,000 aquatic</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX>.
Excursions
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Great Wall</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most popular attraction. From <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX>, splendid sections of the wall can be enjoyed at several locations. Less visited (and less crowded) are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China‚</ENAMEX>Äôs greatest imperial cemeteries: the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ming Tombs</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eastern Qing Tombs</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> other major excursions from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> are the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Peking Man Museum at Zhoudian</ENAMEX> and the vast imperial retreat and temples of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chengde</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Great Wall</ENAMEX>
Construction on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Great Wall</ENAMEX> began <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">as long ago as the fifth century b.c.</TIMEX>; it winds across northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">over 10,000 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6,200 miles</NUMEX>). However, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Great Wall</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wanli Chang Cheng</ENAMEX>) that most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> see consists of a few beautifully restored segments near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> that were built, extended, or refortified during the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ming Dynasty</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">a.d. 1368‚Äì1644</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ming</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">builders</ENAMEX> were the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> to finish these massive earthen fortifications with brick. They built a new section of the wall running for <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">630 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">390 miles</NUMEX>) just north of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> as a massive buffer and early warning system against invaders from the north. This stratagem was to fail, as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manchus</ENAMEX> eventually broke through, overthrew the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ming</ENAMEX>, seized <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX>, and established the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qing Dynasty</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">1644¬†ÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩ¬†China‚</ENAMEX>Äôs last imperial line.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Hundreds of thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">laborers</ENAMEX> were conscripted over the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX> to extend and repair the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Great Wall</ENAMEX>, and many of them lie buried in its ruins. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the seventh century</TIMEX> a.d. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over a million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> were said to be involved in this project, but in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">centuries since¬†‚Äî¬†until the Ming Dynasty¬†‚Äî¬†much</ENAMEX> of the wall fell into ruin. Even <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, most of its length has not been kept up, the earthen remnants barely visible. While it is often reported that the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Great Wall</ENAMEX> is the only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manmade</ENAMEX> object visible from the moon, the claim is dubious at best. Still, it is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China‚</ENAMEX>Äôs grandest achievement, on par with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Egypt‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pyramids</ENAMEX> and a handful of other ancient wonders of the world.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Great Wall</ENAMEX> is best appreciated at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> north of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Badaling</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mutianyu, Simatai</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Juyongguan</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segments</ENAMEX> have been carefully refurbished, with the exception of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Simatai</ENAMEX>, which is largely untouched since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the days</TIMEX> of the early <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Ming Dynasty</ENAMEX>. The earthen foundations of the wall and watchtowers, as well as much of the brick-work, are original, most of it <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">300 to 500 years old</TIMEX>, although extensive remodeling and fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">materials</ENAMEX> have been added.
The look and the feel are authentic enough, once one is on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wall</ENAMEX> itself, out of sight of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendors</ENAMEX>, tour <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">buses</ENAMEX>, parking <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lots</ENAMEX>, and cable <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> below. The hordes of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> are another modern addition, of course, but it is possible at all these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> to walk beyond the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowds</ENAMEX>. The steep mountain scenery is spectacular and the air is usually quite clear. The sheer steepness of the wall‚Äôs stone stairs and the precarious footing provided by the irregular treads are what most surprise first-time <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>. As it snakes up and down the peaks and ridges, the wall conforms to a challenging topography, one that leaves many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> gasping for breath. But the views from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China‚</ENAMEX>Äôs ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dragon of Stone</ENAMEX> make the journey unforgettable.
Carefully restored in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1957</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Great Wall</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Badaling</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">67 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">42 miles</NUMEX>) northwest of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX>, is the most-visited portion of the wall. The mountain setting is spectacular and the wall rises and falls steeply as it winds up and down the ridges. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">About 7</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> ft) high and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5 m</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> ft) wide, this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ming Dynasty</ENAMEX> fortification is built of tamped earth, stone, and brick. <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Beacon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">towers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stone</ENAMEX> and brick are mounted at regular intervals. It is possible to walk the stairs of the restored section for <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 2 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">11‚ÅÑ2 miles</NUMEX>) before reaching the crumbling remains of the original wall on either end. At the northern terminus, there is a cable car connecting the wall to a parking lot below. The parking <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lots</ENAMEX> at the base of the wall are filled with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendors</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, and other modern attractions, including a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cinema</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KFC</ENAMEX> fast-food outlet.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Badaling</ENAMEX> is crowded, especially from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June</TIMEX> through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September</TIMEX>, but it is quite beautiful. Equally attractive is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>-most visited section of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Great Wall</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mutianyu</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">88 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">55 miles</NUMEX>) northeast of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX>. Mutianyu was opened to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</TIMEX> to relieve the crowding at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Badaling</ENAMEX>. There is also a cable <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mutianyu</ENAMEX>, eliminating the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20-minute</TIMEX> hike up to the wall, and at the foot of the wall there is again a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendors</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, and caf√©s. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mutianyu</ENAMEX> is one of the oldest restored sections of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Great Wall</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> area, thought to have been built under the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Ming</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rulers</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nearly 500 years ago</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Visitors</ENAMEX> can walk well over a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kilometer</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">nearly a mile</NUMEX>) atop these ramparts from watchtower to watchtower. At either end you can view the crumbling <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wall</ENAMEX> running to the horizon, broken but still visible. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early spring</TIMEX> and late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fall</TIMEX>, particularly on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekdays</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Great Wall</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mutianya</ENAMEX> is not very crowded. Surrounded by its renowned green <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">forests</ENAMEX>, it is a pleasant alternative to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Badaling</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Great Wall</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Juyongguan</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">58 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">36 miles</NUMEX>) northwest of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> on the way to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Badaling</ENAMEX> section, is the newest portion of the wall open to tourism (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>) and the nearest to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Juyongguan</ENAMEX> contains a massive guard <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> marking one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Great Wall‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most celebrated mountain passes. This guard <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX>, built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1345</TIMEX>, is decorated in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX> carvings, with inscriptions in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tibetan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sanskrit</ENAMEX>, and languages of the northern <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tribes</ENAMEX>. Some of the temples and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX> clustered at the pass in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the days</TIMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ming</ENAMEX> dynasty have also been restored here. The wall can be walked for <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">21‚ÅÑ2 miles</NUMEX>) as it winds over the peaks of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taihang Mountains</ENAMEX>.
The least restored, least crowded major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Great Wall</ENAMEX> near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> is at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Simatai</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">124 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">77 miles</NUMEX>) northeast of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX>. Not only is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Simatai</ENAMEX> rather far from the capital, it is also quite uncrowded and unreconstructed. Its stairways and watchtowers resemble those crumbling edifices one can only glimpse from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Badaling</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mutianyu</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Juyongguan</ENAMEX>. The natural scenery is dramatic, and the ruined state of the wall gives <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Simatai</ENAMEX> a romantic feel (although there is a cable <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> to the top). It is also dangerous, with broken stairways leading up some of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX>-degree inclines. Other portions are in such ruins that one must walk along the outside of the wall on steep, narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">paths</ENAMEX>, where the footing is difficult.
From the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> at the base of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Simatai</ENAMEX> there is a half-mile gravel path to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> stairway, which skirts the small <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Simatai Reservoir</ENAMEX>. The reservoir divides the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Simatai</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wall</ENAMEX> from another section, known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jinshanling</ENAMEX>, which adventurous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hikers</ENAMEX> can also tackle. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Simatai</ENAMEX> consists of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">beacon towers</ENAMEX>, each <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 400 m</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a quarter mile</NUMEX>) apart, which were once used to transmit fire and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">smoke signals¬†‚Äî¬†tower</ENAMEX> by tower¬†‚Äî¬†to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">armies</ENAMEX> encamped below should an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enemy</ENAMEX> be sighted. The highest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">beacon towers</ENAMEX> (known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wangjinglou</ENAMEX>) stands at an elevation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">986 m</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3,235 ft</NUMEX>), affording a grand view southwest toward <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Locals</ENAMEX> say the lights of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> are visible on clear evenings from here.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ming Tombs</ENAMEX>
The valley of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ming Tombs</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">31 miles</NUMEX>) northwest of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX>, is the final resting place of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ming</ENAMEX> emperors. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Courtyards</ENAMEX> and elaborate <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pavilions</ENAMEX>, similar to those in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Forbidden City</ENAMEX>, cap underground <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">burial chambers</ENAMEX> where the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emperor</ENAMEX>, with his empress and concubines, is entombed.
Here, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Spirit Way</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shen Dao</ENAMEX>) <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">61‚ÅÑ2 km</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4 miles</NUMEX>) long¬†‚Äî¬†the most renowned graveyard entrance in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">China¬†‚Äî¬†forms</ENAMEX> a grand introduction to the valley. It is lined with arching entrance gates and an avenue of stone <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> pairs of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">creatures</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">lions</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">elephants</ENAMEX>) and court <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> pairs), the statuary dating from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1435</TIMEX>. Inside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dragon Phoenix Gate</ENAMEX> are the tombs, of which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> have been restored and opened to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tomb</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Emperor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yongle</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Chang Ling</ENAMEX>) is the largest, although its underground <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX>, where the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emperor</ENAMEX> and his empress are buried, has not been opened. Nor have the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">satellite</ENAMEX> vaults, where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yongle‚</ENAMEX>Äôs concubines are entombed. The massive courtyards and pavilions above <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yongle‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">burial chambers</ENAMEX> have been restored, and they house some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ming Tombs‚</ENAMEX>Äô excavated treasures, including imperial armor.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">burial palace</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Emperor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wanli</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Ding Ling</ENAMEX>) honors the 13th <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ming</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emperor</ENAMEX>, who ruled from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1573 to 1620</TIMEX>. His <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">burial vaults</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">27 m</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">88</NUMEX> ft) below ground, are made of marble and cover <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,200 sq m</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">13,000 sq ft</NUMEX>). His white marble throne, golden crown, and red coffin (along with the coffins of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> concubine) remain in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tomb</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhao Ling</ENAMEX> tomb is also open but is less impressive.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ming Tombs</ENAMEX> were once a staple of <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">tours</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Great Wall</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Badaling</ENAMEX>, but foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> have seldom been impressed by the site, finding it dank and poorly restored. A more interesting imperial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cemetery</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eastern Qing Tomb</ENAMEX> site, although it is located at a much greater distance from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eastern Qing</ENAMEX> Tombs
Nearly as vast and monumental as the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Forbidden City</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eastern Qing Tombs</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dong Qing Ling</ENAMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">125 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">78 miles</NUMEX>) northeast of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX>, require a considerable daytrip to view. The journey over country <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX>, while scenic, is slow. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Emperor Sun Zhi</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1644‚Äì1911</ENAMEX>), the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qing Dynasty</ENAMEX>, selected this remote spot in a large mountain valley while on a hunting expedition. It is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China‚</ENAMEX>Äôs largest royal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cemetery</ENAMEX>, with the tombs of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> emperors, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> empresses, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Qing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most famous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rulers</ENAMEX> are buried here, including <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Emperor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Qianlong</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1711‚Äì1799</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Emperor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kangxi</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1654‚Äì1722</ENAMEX>), and the notorious <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Empress Dowager Cixi</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1835‚Äì1908</ENAMEX>).
Like the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ming Tombs</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eastern Qing Tombs</ENAMEX> are entered via a long <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sacred Way</ENAMEX>, lined with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> pairs of stone <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> and court <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>. The oldest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tomb</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Xiao Ling</ENAMEX>) is that of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qing Dynasty</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sun Zhi</ENAMEX>. His tomb is unopened, but the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX> pavilions and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">halls</ENAMEX> on the site can be visited. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tomb</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Emperor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kangxi</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Jing Ling</ENAMEX>) is also unopened, but its magnificent above-ground <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">halls</ENAMEX> contain many original imperial treasures, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kangxi‚Äôs Dragon Throne</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tomb</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Emperor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Qianlong</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yu Ling</ENAMEX>) is open. Located <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">54 m</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">177 ft</ENAMEX>) underground, it consists of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">immense vaults</ENAMEX> and the marble coffins of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manchu</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emperor</ENAMEX> and his <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> favorite consorts.
The most lavish tomb is that of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Empress Dowager Cixi</ENAMEX>. Above her underground <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX>, inside a sacrificial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX>, is a wax <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> showing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cixi</ENAMEX> in full regalia as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goddess of Mercy</ENAMEX> (her favorite <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX> deity). The underground palace contains her double gold-and-lacquer coffin. Unfortunately, the coffin was desecrated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1928</TIMEX> by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">warlord</ENAMEX> who also plundered the tomb‚Äôs treasures, including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25,000</NUMEX> pearls and a burial quilt studded with rare pearls. Many of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cixi‚</ENAMEX>Äôs imperial treasures did survive, and are now on display in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">galleries</ENAMEX> above her <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tomb</ENAMEX>.

The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Peking Man Museum</ENAMEX> is located <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">31 miles</NUMEX>) southwest of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> in the village of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zhoukoudian</ENAMEX>, whose name has become synonymous with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">paleontology</ENAMEX>. In the hills and caves of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zhoukoudian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">archaeologists</ENAMEX> found the skull of a new ancestral link to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mankind</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Homo erectus</ENAMEX> pekinensis¬<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">†‚Äî¬†Peking Man</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">This 1929</TIMEX> discovery suggested that man‚Äôs closest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ancestor</ENAMEX> might have lived in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX> as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX>. Excavations of the site continued until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1937</TIMEX>, when most of the fossils were carried out of war-torn <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreigners</ENAMEX>, never to return.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">cave on Dragon Bone Hill, where Peking Man</ENAMEX> lived <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">690,000 years ago</TIMEX>, showed evidence of a community numbering <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to 40</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>. Nearby caves contained fossils and artifacts from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more</NUMEX>-recent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stone Age</ENAMEX> settlements (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20,000 to 50,000</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX>). These caves may now be visited, their treasures housed in the nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Peking Man Museum</ENAMEX>. Here there are <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">molds</ENAMEX> of the missing skulls, an array of stone tools, the bones of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">prehistoric beasts</ENAMEX>, some human fossils, and a modern statue of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Peking Man</ENAMEX> himself.
Chengde
The small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chengde</ENAMEX> (formerly known in the west as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jehol</ENAMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">250 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">155 miles</NUMEX>) northeast of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX>, requires an overnight stay for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> based in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX>. But it‚Äôs worthwhile for anyone interested in seeing the monumental remains of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qing Dynasty</ENAMEX>, as well as its most spectacular <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX> temples. Chengde became the imperial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Qing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rulers</ENAMEX>, who built a royal <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> here rivaling that of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Forbidden City and Summer Palace</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Qing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rulers</ENAMEX> never forgot their nomadic <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manchu</ENAMEX> roots, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Emperor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kangxi</ENAMEX> developed this remote valley in the countryside as a summer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> and hunting ground in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1703</TIMEX>. It was here that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kangxi‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandson</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Emperor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Qinalong</ENAMEX>, received the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> official <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">delegation</ENAMEX> from the West ever to visit <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> headed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lord</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Macartney</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1793</TIMEX>. And it was here that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lord</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Macartney</ENAMEX> refused to kow-tow (bow) before the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emperor</ENAMEX>, ending any hopes for a peaceful opening of the door to trade in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 18th century</TIMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Chengde Summer Palace</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> is demarcated by a wall <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">91‚ÅÑ2 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6 miles</NUMEX>) around, and its grounds comprise the largest surviving imperial garden in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>. Among the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palaces</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">halls</ENAMEX> still in place are the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Front Palace</ENAMEX>, where the emperors conducted official <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> business, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard halls</ENAMEX> in plain, rustic style. Beyond this cluster of imperial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">halls</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residences</ENAMEX> is a large <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> with lakes, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridges</ENAMEX>, pavilions, rockeries, and the grasslands and hills where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> enjoyed sports on horseback. There are copies of famous <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> gardens here, as well as small temples and multilevel viewing pavilions.
Chengde‚Äôs other main attractions are the temples in the hills outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> Many of these ‚<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">ÄúEight Outer Temples‚</ENAMEX>Äù have a strong <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Tibetan</ENAMEX> flavor. All were built under <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Emperor Qinalong</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1713 and 1779</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mount Sumera Longevity</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Happiness Temple</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Xumifushou Miao</ENAMEX>) commemorates the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Panchen Lama‚Äôs</ENAMEX> visit to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chengde</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1779</TIMEX>. A copy of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lama‚Äôs residence</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shigatse</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tibet</ENAMEX>, it is crowned by a pagoda decorated in green and yellow tiles. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Small Potala Temple</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Putuozongsheng Miao</ENAMEX>), built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1769</TIMEX>, is even larger and more lavish, covering <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">22 hectares</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">54 acres</NUMEX>). Its great red hall evokes the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Potala Palace</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lhasa</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arcades</ENAMEX> within are filled with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX> treasures, including sensual figures related to the esoteric <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Buddhism of the Red Hat sect</ENAMEX>.
Beyond these and the other temples is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hammer Rock</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bangchui Shan</ENAMEX>), a massive stone pinnacle that can be reached by ski lift or hiking <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">trails</ENAMEX>. The view from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this 18-m</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">60-ft</NUMEX>) natural <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> of the valley below, the imperial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>, and the surrounding <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX> temples reveals the wealth and scale of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qing Dynasty</ENAMEX> at its height. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1820</TIMEX> this imperial summer villa was all but abandoned after <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Emperor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jiaqing</ENAMEX> was killed here by a bolt of lightning. Less than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a century later</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qing Dynasty</ENAMEX> itself was destroyed by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX>, ending <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China‚Äôs</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last period</TIMEX> of imperial rule.
