A Brief History
During the last <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fifty years</TIMEX>, a great deal of research has been undertaken to discover more about the great ancient societies of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yucat√°n.</ENAMEX> Huge sections of their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> lives (and particularly why they came to abandon their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>) are still shrouded in mystery, but great strides have been made in deciphering their hieroglyphs and stelae (inscribed stone pillars). Despite these mysteries, there are few places in the world where the past feels as close as it does in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yucat√°n.</ENAMEX> The thatched huts that appear in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1,000-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">carvings</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Uxmal</ENAMEX> can be seen <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> in every roadside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stone metates</ENAMEX>, or grinding dishes, which grace many a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen</ENAMEX> in town or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX>, are identical to those left as offerings to the rain gods in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries past</TIMEX>. Away from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> still speak the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mayan</ENAMEX> tongue, and their religious beliefs still bear the imprint of the ancient rituals of their ancestors. And, perhaps most striking of all, the distinctive hooked nose and sloping forehead of the ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maya</ENAMEX>, whose stony profiles look down on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitor</ENAMEX> from the carved walls of their ruined <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>, are still reflected in the features of the local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>.
The Maya
These people‚Äôs ancestors arrived in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Central America</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">many thousands</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX>. Small bands of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asiatic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hunters</ENAMEX> migrated across the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bering Strait</ENAMEX> land <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">bridge</ENAMEX> before <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">b.c.</ENAMEX> and gradually spread southwards through the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Americas</ENAMEX>. During the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Archaic</ENAMEX> period (after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,200</NUMEX> b.c.), these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> settled in what is now modern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>. They developed a primitive agriculture, domesticating <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cattle</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cultivating corn</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beans</ENAMEX>, chili peppers, and squash (a pumpkin-like vegetable) in burned clearings in the jungle. Over time, a society developed that was so successful they could devote time to activities other than simple food cultivation. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Olmec</ENAMEX>, are considered to be the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mesoamerican</ENAMEX> culture, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> from which all others evolved. They developed a calendar based on a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">52-year</TIMEX> cycle. They also constructed <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pyramids</ENAMEX> for worship.
By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1500</TIMEX> b.c. the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> that came to be known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maya</ENAMEX> settled in an area which stretched from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific</ENAMEX> coast to the southern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Yucat√°n</ENAMEX>, taking in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">modern-day</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guatemala, Belize</ENAMEX>, the western parts of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Salvador</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Honduras</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> state of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeche</ENAMEX>. In the succeeding <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX> they migrated into the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">northern Yucat√</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">°n¬†‚Äî¬†what</ENAMEX> are now the modern <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yucat√°n</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quintana Roo</ENAMEX>, and part of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tabasco</ENAMEX>.
Though their antecedents are still shadowy, they were much influenced by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Olmec</ENAMEX>. They developed and refined the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Olmec</ENAMEX> calendar and counting system, and improved their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> practices. The whole <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yucat√°n</ENAMEX> peninsula witnessed the flowering of classic <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mayan</ENAMEX> civilization and a society of great sophistication; with its magnificent <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pyramids</ENAMEX>, temples, and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palaces</ENAMEX> decorated with wall paintings and carved low-reliefs, a written language of hieroglyphics, and complicated medical procedures to heal the injured or the sick. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mayan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">astronomers</ENAMEX> tracked the movements of the heavenly bodies, predicting eclipses and marking the times for the planting of the new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">corn</ENAMEX>. In fact, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">corn</ENAMEX> came to symbolize life for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Maya¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†in their myths of creation, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mankind</ENAMEX> was formed from lumps of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">maize dough</ENAMEX>. Elaborate rituals grew up around the preparation of the milpas (cornfields) and the planting and harvesting of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crop</ENAMEX> whose success depended on the coming of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rains</ENAMEX>. These rituals were undertaken by a small number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">initiates</ENAMEX> who controlled the knowledge of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maya</ENAMEX>. Because the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> has no surface rivers, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rain</ENAMEX> was a precious resource and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maya</ENAMEX> saw any stock of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, such as the limestone <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> holes or cenotes, as holy <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">places</ENAMEX>. The rain god <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chaac</ENAMEX> was a very important deity, whose image can be seen at every <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mayan</ENAMEX> site.
But there was a dark side to this sophisticated society. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maya</ENAMEX> viewed their gods not as benevolent guides but as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">changeable spirits</ENAMEX> in need of constant appeasement. To incur the wrath of the gods would result in drought, a loss of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crops</ENAMEX>, and certain starvation. To keep the gods happy, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> offered sacrifices at their great pyramid temples. The ceremonies were overseen by a powerful caste of high <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priests</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Grain</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> were used, but the gods came to demand more, and a cult of human sacrifice grew. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maya</ENAMEX> went out on raiding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX>, taking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hostages</ENAMEX> from the surrounding lands to use in their bloody ceremonies. The murals and reliefs at <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mayan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> tell gory tales of beheading and the tearing out of human hearts to appease the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lords</ENAMEX> of the underworld. Archaeologists dredging the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sacred Cenote of Chich√©n Itz√°</ENAMEX> have recovered <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozens</NUMEX> of human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">skeletons</ENAMEX>, thought to be the remains of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> sacrificed to the rain god.
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mayan</ENAMEX> civilization in the northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yucat√°n</ENAMEX> reached its peak around a.d. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">900‚Äì1200</NUMEX>. For reasons still <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">unknown¬†‚Äî¬†perhaps</ENAMEX> civil war, drought, or disease¬†‚Äî¬†the great <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> were abandoned. By the time the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spaniards</ENAMEX> arrived in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 16th century</TIMEX> the jungle was reclaiming the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pyramids</ENAMEX>; the richly painted murals of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">warriors</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mayan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lords</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, and gods were already crumbling and dissolving in the warm <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rain</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priest caste</ENAMEX> seemed to have vanished, along with their knowledge. The only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> found were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX>.
In the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Wake of Cort√</ENAMEX>©s
The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> recorded <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Europeans</ENAMEX> to arrive in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yucat√°n</ENAMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1511</TIMEX>, were doubly unfortunate: a group of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sailors</ENAMEX> survived a shipwreck on the coast of what is now <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quintana Roo</ENAMEX>, only to be sacrificed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mayan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">natives</ENAMEX>. However, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> were allowed to live as slaves and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gonzalo Guerrero</ENAMEX>, went <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">native</ENAMEX> and married the chief‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX>. His <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> were the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> mestizos¬†‚Äî¬†the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of mixed <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> who now make up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">55 percent</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1517</TIMEX>, an expedition led by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francisco Hernandez de Cordob√</ENAMEX>° landed on the west coast of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yucat√°n</ENAMEX>, near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Campeche</ENAMEX>, but were beaten back by a hail of arrows from the hostile <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">natives</ENAMEX>. However, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the following year</TIMEX>, ambitious, young <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Captain Juan de Grijalva</ENAMEX> discovered the island of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cozumel</ENAMEX> and skirted the coast of the peninsula, hearing tales from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indians</ENAMEX> of the great civilization of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aztecs</ENAMEX>. Here, they told him, you can find a city made of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX>.
Grijalva‚Äôs stories focused <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> attention on central <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>, and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1519</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hernan Cort√©s</ENAMEX> landed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Veracruz</ENAMEX>, to start an expedition that would end in the conquest of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moctezuma</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Aztec</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Empire</ENAMEX>. Though he had begun his campaign without the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">King‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">authority</ENAMEX>, once news of the treasures captured by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cort√©s</ENAMEX> reached <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX>, a royal warrant was dispatched to legitimize the victory and create <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚ÄúNew Spain‚Äù¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†the latest <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX>. However, it was left to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Don Francisco de Montejo</ENAMEX>, ‚Äúa gentleman of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Seville</ENAMEX>,‚Äù following in the great conquistador‚Äôs wake, to take possession of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yucat√</ENAMEX>°n in the name of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX>.
Arriving on the coast in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1527</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montejo‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> were hindered by the dense jungle and withering climate, and were met by fierce resistance from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">natives</ENAMEX>. To make matters worse, news of great riches discovered in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Peru</ENAMEX> led many of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> to desert in search of greater rewards. The campaign went so badly that by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1535</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spaniards</ENAMEX> had been completely driven out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yucat√°n.</ENAMEX>
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1537</TIMEX> another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX>, under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">command</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Montejo el Mozo</ENAMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Younger</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Don Francisco‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX>, set out to plant the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> standard on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yucatecan</ENAMEX> soil. At first ill fortune dogged them; the dwindling force was besieged in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Champot√≥n</ENAMEX>, on the west coast, for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> miserable <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>. With reinforcements, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spaniards</ENAMEX> managed to establish a beachhead. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">band</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 57</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>, led by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Montejo el Mozo‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cousin</ENAMEX> (yet another <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Don Francisco</ENAMEX>), marched inland to take the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mayan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T‚ÄôHo.</ENAMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indians</ENAMEX> gathered their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> last great battle, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of them fell upon the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camp</ENAMEX>, now defended by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX> and superior weaponry of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spaniards</ENAMEX> gave them the edge, and they slaughtered <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">warriors</ENAMEX>. After the battle, local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chiefs</ENAMEX> made peace with the invaders and, on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6 January 1542</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Montejos</ENAMEX> founded the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M√</ENAMEX>©rida on the site.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Caste War</ENAMEX>
Under <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> rule, land was taken from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maya</ENAMEX> and turned over to tobacco and sugarcane <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plantations</ENAMEX>, and the once-proud <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indians</ENAMEX> were reduced to farm <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">laborers</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Franciscan</ENAMEX> friars, such as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bishop Diego de Landa</ENAMEX>, were dispatched from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> to spread the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> faith throughout the peninsula, though they were met with some resistance¬†‚Äî¬†any similarity between the early <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Yucatecan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX> and military fortresses is not accidental. Eventually, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maya</ENAMEX> accepted the new faith, but combined it with elements of their old beliefs. Unfortunately, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Landa</ENAMEX> saw it as a sacred duty to destroy the old <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mayan</ENAMEX> ways, and he was responsible for the burning of many chronicles relating to their beliefs and culture.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1821</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> declared its independence from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>. Tension had been simmering for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX>, fostered by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spain‚</ENAMEX>Äôs treatment of her <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">New Spanish</ENAMEX>-born <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">colonists</ENAMEX>, or criollos (deemed to be second-class <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> compared to those born in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">homeland</ENAMEX>). Her trade laws decreed that everything produced in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Spain</ENAMEX> must first cross the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> before being traded with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a third</NUMEX> country so that the proper taxes and tariffs could be collected. The geography of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">northern Yucat√°n</ENAMEX> region separated it physically from the rest of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Spain</ENAMEX>, and fewer colonial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">landowners</ENAMEX> settled here than the area around the new capital (now <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico City</ENAMEX>). Furthermore, this isolation led to the development of a strong independent streak for both <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">colonists</ENAMEX> and indigenous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peoples</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yucat√°n</ENAMEX> declared <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">its independence in 1821</TIMEX> but did not join the fledgling <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1823</TIMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1840</TIMEX>, it changed its mind, and withdrew from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">union</ENAMEX>. This was the catalyst for the oppressed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maya</ENAMEX> to take up <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX> against their colonial oppressors.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1847</TIMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">savage</ENAMEX> uprising known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Caste War</ENAMEX> saw <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mayan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rebels</ENAMEX> massacre white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">settlers</ENAMEX> and take control of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly two-thirds</NUMEX> of the peninsula. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1850</TIMEX> they had driven the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexicans</ENAMEX> back to their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">strongholds</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">M√©rida</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeche</ENAMEX>. However, in an amazing turnaround, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maya‚</ENAMEX>Äôs ancient beliefs became their undoing. Just when the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexicans</ENAMEX> were on the point of surrender, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rains</ENAMEX> came early and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indians</ENAMEX>, obedient to their gods, dropped their <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX> and returned to their milpas to plant the sacred <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">corn</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">settlers</ENAMEX> called in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reinforcements</ENAMEX> and wreaked a terrible revenge on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">natives</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rebels</ENAMEX>, known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Cruz</ENAMEX>, held out in the jungles of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quintana Roo</ENAMEX> around the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tulum</ENAMEX>, harrying the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexicans</ENAMEX> and making the east coast of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yucat√</ENAMEX>°n a dangerous area, off-limits until well into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 20th century</TIMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Henequen Boom</ENAMEX>
Life was difficult in northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yucat√°n</ENAMEX>, as the lack of surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> and the limestone sub-surface made it difficult to grow commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crops</ENAMEX> or raise <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cattle</ENAMEX>. However, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 19th century</TIMEX>, the hacienda or <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plantation</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> found a <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crop</ENAMEX> that grew successfully and was much in demand around the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">world¬†‚Äî¬†the henequen plant</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> produced by henequen could be made into rope and twine, indispensable for sea-faring and international trade. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yucat√°n</ENAMEX> was the principal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">producer</ENAMEX>, exporting their goods through the port of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sisal</ENAMEX> on the northern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">coast</ENAMEX>. Processed henequen soon became known around the world as sisal.
The money earned by the plantation <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> was spent on grand <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansions</ENAMEX> along <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">M√©rida‚Äôs Paseo de Montejo</ENAMEX>; they were filled with the best in furniture, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">porcelain</ENAMEX>, and artwork. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indians</ENAMEX>, however, worked the land for a pittance. In the east, some scraped out a living by tapping the sap of the zapote or chicle <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> and selling it to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturers</ENAMEX> of chewing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gum</ENAMEX>. Unfortunately, when the henequen bubble burst in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1930s</TIMEX> with the advent of synthetic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX>, the peninsula fell into an economic decline from which there seemed to be little hope of respite.
Meanwhile, under the presidency of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Porfirio Diaz</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Quintana Roo on the Yucat√°n peninsula‚</ENAMEX>Äôs eastern coast, ¬†named after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andreas Quintana Roo</ENAMEX> ‚Äî a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> and independence movement leader <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between 1810 and 1821¬†‚</NUMEX>Äî was declared a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">territory</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1902</TIMEX>. Government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> clamped down on rebellious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indians</ENAMEX>, who continued to resist until a peace treaty was finally negotiated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1935</TIMEX>. The overthrow of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Porfirio Diaz</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1917</TIMEX> led to reform and a new constitution, including a bill of rights for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">haciendas</ENAMEX> were broken up and returned to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yucat√°n</ENAMEX> remained a backwater, largely forgotten and ignored. No overland route existed from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M√</ENAMEX>©rida to the rest of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1949</TIMEX>, when the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> railway arrived. Before then, all commercial travel to and from the peninsula was by sea, and it was faster and easier to travel to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> than to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico City</ENAMEX>.
Mexico‚Äôs Mega-Resort
Despite its considerable oil reserves and mineral wealth, debt, booming population growth, and grinding poverty have crippled the economy of modern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>. In an effort to bring more hard currency into the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> decided to promote tourism. A <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three-year</TIMEX> study of various sites was conducted by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">consortium</ENAMEX> of government and private interests, and the deserted island of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canc√∫n</ENAMEX> won out: not only was it a beautiful spot, but its use would revive the flagging economy of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yucat√°n</ENAMEX> and finally bring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quintana Roo</ENAMEX> into the fold. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">territory</ENAMEX> was eventually granted statehood in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1974</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the same year</TIMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canc√∫n</ENAMEX> opened to the public.
Canc√∫n is now <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mexico‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most popular holiday destination, pulling in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost three million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each year</TIMEX>. New <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX> have appeared, and televisions and refrigerators are now the norm in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> that didn‚Äôt even have electricity <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20 years ago</TIMEX>. Despite creating a pocket of wealth for the region, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> itself suffered a number of crises in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1980s and 1990s</TIMEX>, including a drastic devaluation of the peso in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX> following <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> of economic chaos. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> extended <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">40 billion dollars</NUMEX> in loans to stabilize the monetary system. However, confidence in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> is still low, and the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">22%</NUMEX> increase in the price of tortillas, the basic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 2000</TIMEX> indicates that the problems are not yet over.
These questions are for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> based in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico City</ENAMEX>, many miles from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yucat√°n.</ENAMEX> A greater question for the region itself: Can the development be controlled? What was a deserted coastline <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two decades ago</TIMEX> is now <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a bustling</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Riviera</ENAMEX>. Coral reefs are being damaged by careless <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">divers</ENAMEX>; lagoons that once teemed with tropical <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> are now being polluted by suntan lotion; the beaches where sea <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">turtles</ENAMEX> once laid their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX> are being taken over by sun-beds and volleyball nets; crocodiles and manatees that once cruised the coastal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX> are now endangered <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>. Conservation areas such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rio Lagartos</ENAMEX>, in the north, give hope for the future, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conservationists</ENAMEX> lost <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> recent battle, when they were powerless to prevent the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">International Pier</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Maya</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cozumel</ENAMEX> from being built directly on top of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North Paradise Reef</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Canc√∫n¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†in fact the whole <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Yucat√°n peninsula¬†‚Äî¬†is</ENAMEX> embroiled in an important struggle, one that is being faced all over the world¬†‚Äî¬†the battle between the conflicting demands of development and conservation.
