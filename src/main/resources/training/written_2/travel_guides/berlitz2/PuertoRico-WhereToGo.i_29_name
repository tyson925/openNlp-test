Where to Go
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX> is an island of contrasts, perhaps the only destination in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX> where the city <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> hold as much allure as the beaches. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One third</NUMEX> of the island‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">just over three million</NUMEX> live in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Juan</ENAMEX>, which is undoubtedly the draw for many. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the leading commercial and industrial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX>, it is characterized by high-rise office <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">blocks</ENAMEX> and sprawling suburbs. It‚Äôs the delights and historical treasures of the old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, however, that capture the eyes and imaginations of most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>. And beyond the limits of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> are mountains, rivers and lakes, forests, and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plantations</ENAMEX> waiting to be explored.
Old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Juan</ENAMEX>
Old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Juan</ENAMEX> is without doubt <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the most spectacular sights of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX>. Founded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1521</TIMEX>, it is partially surrounded by walls and fortifications that have protected it from modernization and indiscriminate development. The carefully preserved historic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> and public <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> retain many of the most charming features of the original <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> colonial architecture. Cobblestone <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stones</ENAMEX> were brought as ballast on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX>, which went <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> filled with treasure and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX>), tiny squares, and grand plazas surprise <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> at every turn as they wander the neat grid of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> planned <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four centuries ago</TIMEX>.
Only <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> blocks wide, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Juan</ENAMEX> can easily be covered on foot, though there are some steep ascents that may be challenging in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX> heat. Even if you only have <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX>, you‚Äôll be able to enjoy its delights. If possible, however, take <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least a couple of days</TIMEX>. Enjoying a rest in a shady <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plaza</ENAMEX> or taking a long lunch at an outdoor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">caf√</ENAMEX>© are just as much a part of your trip as a tour around the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Juan</ENAMEX> is a living <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, and it‚Äôs especially bustling after dark, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowds throng</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> or simply stroll the narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> and airy plazas.
Begin your exploration at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Plaza de Col√≥n</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Columbus Square</ENAMEX>). If you take a taxi from the outlying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> areas, this is a good place to alight¬†‚Äî¬†before traffic in the narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> forces your <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicle</ENAMEX> to a halt. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> was named after <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Columbus</ENAMEX> on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">400th</NUMEX> anniversary of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Rico‚</ENAMEX>Äôs discovery, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1893</TIMEX>. After admiring the unusually tall statue of the discoverer, leave the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> from the northeastern corner and walk along <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Boulevard</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">del Valle</ENAMEX>; this is a pretty <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> with a series of brightly painted <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>, but the traffic can be busy.
At the top of the hill, on the right, you‚Äôll find the towering walls of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fuerte San Crist√≥bal</ENAMEX>, the largest fort in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">It‚Äôs</ENAMEX> also the youngest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fort</ENAMEX> on the island, built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 18th century</TIMEX> to plug a hole in the easterly <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">defenses</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. From atop the brick walls, which withstood fierce attacks by cannonballs and other projectiles, you can enjoy panoramic views out to the east and over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Juan Bay</ENAMEX> to the modern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. The fort‚Äôs vast interior <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX> now echoes with the sound of running <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> rather the marching of soldier‚Äôs boots, but <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dormitory</ENAMEX> of the old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">barracks</ENAMEX> has been re-created, with bunks lining the walls and uniforms hung neatly on pegs. Take the long dark walk to the dungeons to find a faded drawing of a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> galleon sketched on the wall by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">captain</ENAMEX> accused of treason.
After visiting the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">fort</ENAMEX> continue west along <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Boulevard del Valle</ENAMEX>, which becomes <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Calle Norzagaray</ENAMEX>. Here you‚Äôll be tempted by fine views of the sea; you may even catch sight of a cruise <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ship</ENAMEX> sailing gracefully into <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX>. This route sits against the old city walls, which were completed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1785</TIMEX>, and from here it is easy to see why the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> was thought to be impregnable. Thanks to the high, thick walls and the watch-towers with their distinctive rounded roofs, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> could be sure that no one would approach unseen.
After a walk of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about half a mile you‚Äôll</NUMEX> find the plain fa√ßade of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Museo de Arte e Historia</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Juan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum of Art</ENAMEX> and History) on your left. Once a major market place for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1855</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> now houses a major collection of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Puerto Rican</ENAMEX> art.
Just past the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>, a large, open grassy area comes into view. If you happen to be here on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a weekend</TIMEX> you‚Äôll find <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Puerto Rican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> out flying kites. This area is the best place to take advantage of the sea breezes, and many kites soar <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">hundreds of feet</NUMEX> up in the air. When collisions occur or lines get crossed, jovial banter breaks out between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">parties¬†‚Äî¬†it‚Äôs</ENAMEX> a very social activity. The grassy area, cut by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> gravel path, leads to the end of the promontory¬†‚Äî¬†and the mighty <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fuerte San Felipe del Morro</ENAMEX>, usually simply referred to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as ‚</NUMEX>ÄúEl <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morro‚Äù</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">meaning ‚Äúthe headland‚Äù</ENAMEX>). On your right as you walk toward the entrance you‚Äôll pass the old city <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cemetery</ENAMEX> resting between the walls and the sea. The ornate tombs are still carefully attended and hold the remains of some of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Rico‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most illustrious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>. The entrance to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Morro</ENAMEX> is reached across a wide dry <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">moat</ENAMEX>, a last defense against attack. Walk through the huge curved doorway to the heart of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">fort</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Morro</ENAMEX> was one of the most formidable citadels in the world. During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16th and 17th centuries</TIMEX> it was one of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ring</ENAMEX> of forts that held the key to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> power in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX>. The watchtowers of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Morro</ENAMEX> look out to sea and inland across <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Juan Bay</ENAMEX> to the coastal plains beyond. The multilevel <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">defenses</ENAMEX> made it possible to fire <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX> from sea level up to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">hundreds of feet</NUMEX> above ground. Despite some serious attempts by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">forces</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">fort</ENAMEX> was never forcibly taken.
Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1845</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lighthouse</ENAMEX> here has provided protection for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX> off the coast; the present light dates from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1908</TIMEX>. The old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">barracks</ENAMEX> and ammunition <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">arsenal</ENAMEX> now house a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>, which offers an audio-visual presentation about the history of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">fort</ENAMEX> (in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> on alternate <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">half hours</TIMEX>).
After exploring the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">fort</ENAMEX>, walk back across the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">grassy lawns</ENAMEX>. (At the small traffic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">circle</ENAMEX> at the end of the driveway you‚Äôll find refreshment <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stalls</ENAMEX> where you can get a cool drink or snack before moving on.) Young <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Puertorrique√±os</ENAMEX> have taken to skateboarding and rollerblading on nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plaza del Quartel Ballaj√°.</ENAMEX> They gather <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX> at this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> to compete with their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peers</ENAMEX> and show off their skills to passersby.
To the left is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cuartel de Ballaj√°</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ballaj√° Barracks</ENAMEX>), once the major army <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">barracks</ENAMEX> under <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> rule and now a significant cultural attraction. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> floor of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> houses the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum of the Americas</ENAMEX>. The museum‚Äôs mission is to gather collections of artifacts of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Amerindian</ENAMEX> culture, including folk art, basket-ware from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colombia</ENAMEX>, and ceremonial masks and costumes from around <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Central America</ENAMEX>. 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">barracks</ENAMEX> themselves are also interesting¬†‚Äî¬†large open <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> that used to house <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX> and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> face in toward a large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX>, where drills were carried out. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> now remains eerily quiet (unless a school <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> is touring the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>).
Opposite the entrance to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barracks</ENAMEX> is the long white <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institute of Puerto Rican Culture</ENAMEX>. A new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> is planned for this space, but in the meantime temporary art exhibitions display the best of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Puerto Rican</ENAMEX> painting and sculpture.
Follow <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Calle Beneficencia</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> leading off the right side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">barracks</ENAMEX>, back towards <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">You‚Äôll</ENAMEX> soon come to a small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> on your left with a huge totemic sculpture. This is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plaza del Quinto Centenario</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Quincentenary Square</ENAMEX>). The sculpture symbolizes the 500 years of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Rico‚</ENAMEX>Äôs existence. On close inspection, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amerindian</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> themes can be seen, but some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> are a little obscure.
Walk on to reach another small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Plaza San Jos√©</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">San Jos√© Square</ENAMEX>), one of the gems of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. Situated close to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Morro</ENAMEX>, it was once one of the most important squares in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Juan</ENAMEX>. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> is a statue of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Juan Ponce de Le√≥n</ENAMEX> in full regalia that was <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cast</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1797</TIMEX> from the iron of a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cannon</ENAMEX>, confiscated after their unsuccessful attack on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. Edged by historic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> has changed little since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th century</TIMEX>, except that many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> have been converted to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bars</ENAMEX>. This is a good place to come after dark and watch the world go by.
On the north flank of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Spanish Gothic Iglesia San Jos√©</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Jos√© Church</ENAMEX>), the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>-oldest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New World</ENAMEX>. The plain white fa√ßade reflects the sunlight, helping cool the interior. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ponce de Le√≥n</ENAMEX> was interred here for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">over 300 years</TIMEX> before being moved to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Juan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Cathedral</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1908</TIMEX>. Attached to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> is a large <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> that was originally a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dominican Convent</ENAMEX>. It was an army <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">barracks</ENAMEX> until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1966</TIMEX>, when it was taken under the auspices of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institute of Puerto Rican Culture</ENAMEX>. You can enter the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> and see the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> cloistered <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floors</ENAMEX> that flank it. Art exhibitions are held here regularly.
On the east side of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Plaza San Jos√©</ENAMEX> are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> important <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>. In the corner is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pablo Casals Museum</ENAMEX>, dedicated to the life of the cello virtuoso and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">composer</ENAMEX>, who lived the last <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> of his life in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX>. Casals was responsible for injecting life back into the classical genre here; he sponsored a classical music festival which still takes place <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every June</TIMEX>. Next to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Casals Museum</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Casa de los Contrafuertes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House of the Buttresses</ENAMEX>), named after the sturdy stone supports that reach out at angles from the walls. It is thought to be the oldest privately owned <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Old San Juan</ENAMEX>, dating from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 18th century</TIMEX>. There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX> on the upper floors: the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pharmacy Museum¬</ENAMEX>†‚Äî¬†a complete apothecary‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop</ENAMEX> with bottles and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">scales¬†‚Äî¬†and</ENAMEX> above it, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin American</ENAMEX> Print.
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Leave Plaza San Jos√©</ENAMEX> via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calle Cristo</ENAMEX>. Halfway down this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> on your left you‚Äôll find the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Catedral de San Juan</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Juan Cathedral</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> dates from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1540</TIMEX>, though a comprehensive restoration was carried out in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 19th century</TIMEX>. The interior features pretty trompe l‚Äôoeil details that add depth to the plain columns and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">domes</ENAMEX>. On the northern wall is the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tomb</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ponce de Le√≥n</ENAMEX>; he shares this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">place</ENAMEX> of honor with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San P√≠o</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catholic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">martyr</ENAMEX> whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">remains</ENAMEX> were brought from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1862</TIMEX>.
Facing the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">cathedral</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plazuela de las Monjas</ENAMEX>, a tiny <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> filled with <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>, where courting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couples</ENAMEX> and old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX> take advantage of the shade. You may also catch the sound of jingling bells signaling that the local ice-cream <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">seller</ENAMEX> is around. On the north side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">El Convento Hotel</ENAMEX>, a great place to take a break. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX> has an interesting history because, as the name suggests, it started life as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">convent</ENAMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1651</TIMEX>. Unfortunately, as the number of nuns declined, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">convent</ENAMEX> was forced to close, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decaying year</TIMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>, played host to the best and busiest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">brothel</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. It was also one of the cheapest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> in town before being rescued and transformed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1990s</TIMEX>.
On the western <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">flank</ENAMEX> of the square you‚Äôll find the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museo del Ni√±o</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Children‚Äôs Museum</ENAMEX>). No sterile display cases full of artifacts here! This is an entertaining, hands-on activity <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> can be <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> and yet still have a learning experience. There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floors</ENAMEX> of interactive exhibits, including a real dentist‚Äôs chair where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mom</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> can be examined by their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">offspring</ENAMEX>, and a giant bubble machine on the upper floor.
Behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> are a number of other important attractions. Take <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calle las Monjas</ENAMEX> toward <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Juan Bay</ENAMEX>. After a short distance you‚Äôll arrive at the western <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wall</ENAMEX> and a small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Plazuela de la Rogativa</ENAMEX>, with a bronze statue commemorating the torchlight religious procession, or rogativa, that saved the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1797</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">It‚Äôs</ENAMEX> believed that the lights held by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bishop</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> fooled the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> in the bay into assuming that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reinforcements</ENAMEX> had arrived. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> fled empty-handed.
Just a short walk north of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Casa Blanca</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>), which for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">250 years</TIMEX> was the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">home</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">descendants</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ponce de Le√≥n</ENAMEX>. Something of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mini-fortress</ENAMEX>, safe behind its own high wall, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> itself is fascinating¬†‚Äî¬†the interior is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> to life in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16th- and 17th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Juan</ENAMEX>, with many <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> full of period furniture.
Walk back toward the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plazuela de la Rogativa</ENAMEX> and peer over the city <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wall</ENAMEX>, which rises <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">over 100 ft</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">301‚ÅÑ2 m</ENAMEX>) at this point. The plain fa√ßade is broken by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Juan Gate</ENAMEX>, which was once the only entrance to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> from the old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX>. The gate was constructed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1639</TIMEX>, and the walls were completed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1641</TIMEX>. Every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> who traveled across the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> would enter through this narrow passage¬†‚Äî¬†many would make their way directly to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cathedral</ENAMEX> to give thanks for a safe <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">arrival¬†‚Äî¬†and</ENAMEX> all goods were transported through here. The thick wooden doors are an impressive sight; they were locked and guarded <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">each night</TIMEX> but now remain open to allow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to stroll along the seafront.
Make your way back to the cathedral along <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Calle San Juan</ENAMEX> and turn right once again at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calle Cristo</ENAMEX>. You‚Äôll pass some interesting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> that might tempt you to browse for a while (the designer outlet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> are particularly popular). Turn right at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calle Fortaleza</ENAMEX> to reach <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jewels</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Juan</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Fortaleza</ENAMEX>. Now the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">home</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Governor</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX>, this fort is in fact a historic monument dating back to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1533</TIMEX>. It was the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> fortification built by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founders</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Juan</ENAMEX> and has been in constant use since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that time</TIMEX>. Of course it has grown over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">centuries¬†‚Äî¬†you‚Äôll</ENAMEX> find extensions and renovations in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baroque, Gothic</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Neo-Classic</ENAMEX> styles. Now a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Historic Site</ENAMEX>, this fascinating <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> is full of period furniture. You can tour the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and its extensive gardens, but you must book in advance.
At the southern end of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calle Cristo</ENAMEX>, at the edge of the city <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wall</ENAMEX>, is tiny <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Capilla del Cristo</ENAMEX>. This chapel was said to have been built in the memory of a young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1753</TIMEX>, raced his <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horse</ENAMEX> down <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Calle Cristo</ENAMEX>, was unable to stop the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> in time, and fell over the wall to his death. Others say that, in fact, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">chapel</ENAMEX> was built to commemorate the fact that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> was saved by divine intervention at this very spot. Whichever is true, the chapel now stands as a barrier to any other such mishap.
To the left of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">chapel</ENAMEX> is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Casa del Libro</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House of Books</ENAMEX>), a small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> devoted to rare books and the printing and binding arts. Next door is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Centro Nacional de Artes y Artesan√≠as</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Popular Arts and Crafts Center</ENAMEX>), a showcase of modern art and crafts managed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institute of Puerto Rican Culture</ENAMEX>. Temporary exhibitions are mounted here, and some items are occasionally made available for purchase.
To the right of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">chapel</ENAMEX> is the entrance to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parque de las Palomas</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pigeon Park</ENAMEX>), clinging to the side of the city <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wall</ENAMEX> and a favorite with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> can be a little <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">oppressive¬†‚Äî¬†it‚</ENAMEX>Äôs always a flurry of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pigeons¬†‚Äî¬†but</ENAMEX> at least pause long enough to admire the panoramic views across <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Juan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">harbor</ENAMEX>.
Back at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calle Fortaleza</ENAMEX>, take a right and continue to the intersection of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calle San Jos√©</ENAMEX>. Here you‚Äôll pass fascinating small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> selling art and crafts from around the world. Wooden carvings from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX> sit side by side with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Haitian native</ENAMEX> paintings.
Take a left and a block farther down you‚Äôll enter <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Plaza de Armas</ENAMEX>. This was the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> central <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Old San Juan</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">City Hall</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alcald√≠a</ENAMEX>, still sits on its northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">side</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX> used to drill here, hence the name (armas means <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX>, or arms), but <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> it is simply a place for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to meet and have a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX>, or sit and chat. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Workers</ENAMEX> enjoy picnic lunches here at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midday</TIMEX>; old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> while away the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alcald√≠a</ENAMEX> has an interesting interior, with checkerboard marble <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floors</ENAMEX> and magnificent chandeliers. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">It‚Äôs</ENAMEX> usually open on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekdays</TIMEX>; you can check with the tourist information <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> on the ground floor as to whether it‚Äôs OK to wander around.
Back on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calle Fortaleza</ENAMEX>, walk east until you reach the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Casa de Callej√≥n</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House of the Alley</ENAMEX>) on the corner of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Callej√≥n de Capilla</ENAMEX>. A fine example of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">an 18th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>, it is now the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Puerto Rican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Family</ENAMEX>, full of the furniture, toys, and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">daily</ENAMEX> artifacts of a well-to-do <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Juan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>.
Taking a left out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> brings you back to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Plaza Col√≥n</ENAMEX>, from where you can make your way south toward <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Juan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">harbor</ENAMEX>. Along the way you‚Äôll pass <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Teatro Tapia</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tapia Theater</ENAMEX>) named after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Puerto Rican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">playwright</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alejandro Tapia y Rivera</ENAMEX>. The splendid fa√ßade was restored in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1976</TIMEX>, the interior remodeled in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">theater</ENAMEX> hosts regular performances of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ballet</ENAMEX>, dance, and drama, often showcasing works by modern <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Puerto Rican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> and choreographers.
You can‚Äôt miss the harbor. Just look for the huge cruise <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX>, which dwarf the surrounding <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>. The cruise port comprises several large jetties, from whence <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> disembark on a regular basis. Walk west along the seafront in the direction of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>. Next to the ultramodern cruise-ship wharfs you‚Äôll will find the rather down-at-the-heel commercial ferry <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">jetty</ENAMEX>, which caters to the small <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> that ply across the harbor to the modern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. Taking one of these little <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> is one of the best ways to take in the size of the harbor and the old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">You‚Äôll</ENAMEX> also get to see <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Ricans</ENAMEX> at work, and and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">play¬†‚Äî¬†snacking</ENAMEX> on empanadillas (pastry turnovers filled with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meat</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cheese</ENAMEX>) and enjoying salsa music.
Near the ferry <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dock</ENAMEX>, across <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calle Marina</ENAMEX>, you‚Äôll see the rising edifice of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Juan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post Office</ENAMEX>, a magnificent <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Art-Deco</ENAMEX> features. In front of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">post office</ENAMEX> is a tiny tourist information <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">La Casita</ENAMEX>, where you can pick up maps and information.
Continue past the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post Office</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">adjoining Plaza de Hostos</ENAMEX>, which is full of souvenir <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stalls</ENAMEX> (and faux <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">designer</ENAMEX> watches galore). To the left is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arsenal de la Marina</ENAMEX>, a fine <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> with strange Moorish details. Built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1800</TIMEX>, it houses the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fine Arts and Folk Arts</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">departments</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institute of Puerto Rican Culture</ENAMEX>. In front of you is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paseo de la Princessa</ENAMEX>, a smart promenade that has emerged from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> of neglect to become the place in town to stroll in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the evening</TIMEX>, or to sit and watch the world go by. A number of new statues and fountains now grace the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paseo</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX>, named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Raices</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roots</ENAMEX>), depicts <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of each of the races that have contributed to the modern <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Puerto Rican mix</ENAMEX>, surrounded by <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">playful dolphins</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Princessa</ENAMEX>, home of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Puerto Rico Tourist Company</ENAMEX>, sits along the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paseo</ENAMEX>. Originally a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">prison¬†‚Äî¬†this</ENAMEX> is why it is outside the city <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">walls¬†‚Äî¬†it</ENAMEX> is now a showcase of modern <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Puerto Rican</ENAMEX> art.
Metropolitan <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Juan</ENAMEX>
Toward <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the 18th century</TIMEX>, the city <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fathers</ENAMEX> realized that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Juan</ENAMEX> was becoming overcrowded, so they decided to break through a section of the vast wall and expand the city‚Äôs borders. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gangs</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">laborers</ENAMEX> were hired to carry out the job (you can see photographs of them in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fuerte San Crist√≥bal</ENAMEX>). This action altered the perception that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Juan</ENAMEX> was a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">citadel city¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†already an anachronism at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">time¬†‚Äî¬†and</ENAMEX> plans were drawn up to develop the area immediately east of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, an area that became known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Puerta de Tierra</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúgateway to the land.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äù Today</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Juan</ENAMEX> stretches all the way around the bay. A number of the modern suburbs, though primarily residential, have some interesting attractions for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>.
Just outside the old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, facing out toward the sea, is the impressive <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Capitolio</ENAMEX>, home of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legislature</ENAMEX>. Constructed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1925</TIMEX>, it has already been recognized as a historic monument. Continuing beyond this sight, you‚Äôll pass some rather careworn <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> before reaching <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Parque Mu√±oz Rivera</ENAMEX>, one of the places where local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> like to relax on the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekends</TIMEX>. There are areas of formal gardens, a small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">fort</ENAMEX>, and children‚Äôs play area. A seafront promenade to the north sees <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> strolling on warm <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekend</TIMEX> evenings; the beach, though very narrow, is the nearest <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to the old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, and it‚Äôs always crowded in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the afternoon</TIMEX> and on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekends</TIMEX>.
A series of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridges</ENAMEX> lead across a small strait to modern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Juan</ENAMEX>, or to the right to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Condado</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> area.
Miramar, a pleasant residential <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">quarter</TIMEX> with fine family <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX>, benefits from its position alongside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Isla Grande</ENAMEX> commuter <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX>. Santurce, a business and residential area, has few attractions except for a concentration of movie <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palaces</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Centro de Bellas Artes</ENAMEX>, the largest performing arts <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX>. Housing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">theaters</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> rehearsal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">halls</ENAMEX>, this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> has spearheaded a resurgence in the popularity of traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Puerto Rican</ENAMEX> music and dance. It also has a regular program of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">performers</ENAMEX> from around the world.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hato Rey‚</ENAMEX>Äôs unexpected, futuristic skyline marks it as the financial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">center</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX>. Those skyscrapers are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> on which they stand has been nicknamed the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Milla de Oro</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Golden Mile</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">R√≠o Piedras</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">home</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Puerto Rico</ENAMEX>. Its considerable campus serves <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">university museum</ENAMEX>, in a modern <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-story <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> nearby, exhibits contemporary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Puerto Rican</ENAMEX> paintings and sculptures, along with archaeological evidence of the talents of the island‚Äôs original <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhabitants</ENAMEX>.
More <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> relics, plus old <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish</ENAMEX> coins and tiles, can be viewed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ponce de Le√≥n Museum</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caparra</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4‚ÄÇmiles</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">61‚ÅÑ2 km</NUMEX>) west of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Juan</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Route 2</ENAMEX>. Alongside this small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">white museum</ENAMEX> are the ruins of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">house Ponce de Le√≥n</ENAMEX> built and from which he directed the colonization of the island. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1521</TIMEX>, after a number of outbreaks of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, the capital was moved to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Juan</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Caparra</ENAMEX> was abandoned. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">What‚Äôs</ENAMEX> left of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ponce de Le√≥n‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> looks like ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> ruins, earnestly preserved.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cata√±o</ENAMEX> is an industrial area visible directly across the bay from the old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. Most of its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>, though important to the economy of the island, spoil the view, but one is of rather more interest to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Bacardi rum plant</ENAMEX> offers an interesting and well-organized free guided tour. Small motorized <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trains</ENAMEX> carry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> to the distilling and bottling <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>. Free <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> are dispensed, and in the gift shop you can buy bottles to take back home. For those more interested in history than in the production of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rum</ENAMEX>, there is a fascinating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> that relates the story of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bacardi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> (who still own the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX>), from their arrival in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>, to their flight to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX> after the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Cuban revolution</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1959</TIMEX>, to their influence on the global drinks market.
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">San Juan‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Resorts</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Puerto Rico‚</ENAMEX>Äôs popularity as a holiday <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> has risen enormously since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1960s</TIMEX>. Most of the development and tourist infrastructure lies in a narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">strip</ENAMEX> along the coast, east of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Juan</ENAMEX>. Condado was the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>; it had already been on the map with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">jet</ENAMEX> set and saw further expansion when a string of high-rise <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> were built along the long stretches of sandy beach. Its main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Ashford Avenue</ENAMEX>, has something of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Art-Deco</ENAMEX> feel of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Miami‚Äôs South Beach</ENAMEX>. As you stroll past the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> selling expensive top-drawer merchandise, you‚Äôre likely to pass a number of impeccably dressed older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> carrying impeccably coiffed toy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">poodles</ENAMEX>. As time has passed, the young energy has moved east, taking advantage of available land, and now <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Isla Verde</ENAMEX>, farther along the coast, has been developed¬<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">†‚Äî¬†some</ENAMEX> say overdeveloped. This is where all the real action is. A number of large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">theaters</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">casinos</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> attract high-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rollers</ENAMEX>. Fast-food <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX>, and gift <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> fill the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> main beaches of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Isla Verde</ENAMEX> are impressive (and they get very busy), but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> is very close to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX> and can get a little noisy.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northeast</ENAMEX>
Heading east out of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Isla Verde</ENAMEX>, it takes <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">only a couple of minutes</TIMEX> to leave the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> behind. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">coast</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Route 187</ENAMEX>) leads past the end of the runway at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Mu√±oz Mar√≠n Airport</ENAMEX> on the left and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Isla Verde‚</ENAMEX>Äôs balneario (public beach) on the right. Travel over the little bridge that spans the entrance to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laguna la Torrecilla</ENAMEX>, and suddenly you are in the countryside.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> runs along the coastline and through the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Bosque Estatal de Pi√±ones</ENAMEX>, an area of beautiful sandy beaches and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">coconut palms</ENAMEX> that until recently was a pristine environment where sleepy <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cattle</ENAMEX> sat under the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>. It is now a popular weekend picnic spot for city <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>, many of whom leave their litter behind when they depart. This sort of carelessness spoils <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pi√±ones</ENAMEX> (and many other beauty spots on the eastern coastline within easy reach of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Juan</ENAMEX>); an assemblage of broken bottles, leftover <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX>, litter, and worse is something you can‚Äôt fail to notice.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Head</ENAMEX> through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lo√≠za</ENAMEX>, and on towards <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">R√≠o Grande</ENAMEX>. Here <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Route 187 meets Route 3</ENAMEX>, one of the major arterial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX> around <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX>; it‚Äôs a very busy <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">highway</ENAMEX>, so be aware and drive carefully. Take a left and proceed to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Route 191</ENAMEX>; then turn right and head up toward <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Yunque</ENAMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anvil</ENAMEX>), the most famous mountain in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX>. Normally capped with clouds it catches from the passing sea breezes, and sometimes entirely lost in a blanket of gray storm-clouds, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,496</NUMEX>-ft (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,088-m</NUMEX>) peak stands at the center of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caribbean National Forest</ENAMEX>, an area of virgin rain forest preserved since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1876</TIMEX>, when the island was still a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX>. Originally a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">12,300 acres</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4,998 hectares</NUMEX>), it now covers <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">28,000 acres</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">11,330 hectares</NUMEX>) and is managed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US Forestry Department</ENAMEX>.
The whole area is a place of staggering proportions: there are over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> species of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">native</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> specimen is said to be over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2,500 years old</TIMEX>; some <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> are so wide it takes several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to reach around them; others soar <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">hundreds of feet</NUMEX> into the air. The forest gets <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">over 180 inches</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">41ÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩ2 m</ENAMEX>) of rain each <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">year¬†‚Äî¬†that‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">some 100 billion gallons</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">450 billion liters</NUMEX>) of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> that live here are also amazing. This is one of the last habitats of the threatened <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Puerto Rican parrot</ENAMEX>. The infamous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coqu√≠</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47</NUMEX>)is, of course, heard everywhere. All in all, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> in an impressive sight, with slope after slope of vegetation laced with mountain streams and beautiful waterfalls and mountain peaks extend away into the distance.
Arriving via <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Route 191</ENAMEX> you‚Äôll come right to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">El Portal Tropical Forest Center</ENAMEX> at the entrance to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>. This <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> presents important information about the history of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>, its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal species</ENAMEX>, and its role in the local ecology. You can then travel on higher into the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>, toward the summit. You can‚Äôt drive the whole <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">8 miles</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">13 km</NUMEX>) between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">visitors center</ENAMEX> and the end of the road, but there are several car <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX> and rest areas on the way, so there‚Äôs ample access. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> popular stops are <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">La Coca Falls</ENAMEX>, on the right after the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5-mile</NUMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8-km</TIMEX>) point, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Yokah√∫ Observation Tower</ENAMEX>, at the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">51‚ÅÑ2-mile</NUMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9-km</TIMEX>) point. Here you can photograph the surrounding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">slopes</ENAMEX>. The most spectacular cascade in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">La Mina Falls</ENAMEX>, is just a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30-minute</TIMEX> walk from the roadside, via <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Big Tree Trail</ENAMEX>.
Take a walk on any of the well-marked <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">trails</ENAMEX>: the atmosphere is humid and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">vegetation</ENAMEX> constantly damp (your best <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> will be your insect repellent and your stout shoes), but the landscape is beautiful and fascinating.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Yunque</ENAMEX> is included in many tours from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Juan</ENAMEX>; these usually include a trip to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Luquillo Beach</ENAMEX>, which lies in the shadow of the peak, to the north. There is a popular balneario at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Luquillo</ENAMEX>, which has restrooms, snack <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bars</ENAMEX>, and a children‚Äôs play area. The beach is kept tidy and there is ample parking.
After <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Luquillo</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Route 3</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">curves</ENAMEX> around toward the east coast of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> and to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fajardo</ENAMEX>, which is a stepping-stone to the offshore islands of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vieques</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Culebra</ENAMEX>. There is little to hold you in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, except for a finger of land reaching north out into the ocean. Take <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Route 997</ENAMEX> to explore this area. On the way, you‚Äôll pass a large <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">marina</ENAMEX> with fleets of charter <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">El Conquistador Resort and Country Club</ENAMEX> with its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">golf course</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">marina</ENAMEX>, and private offshore <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX>. At the very tip of the peninsula is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bahia la Cabezas</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Cabezas de San Juan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nature Reserve</ENAMEX>, one of the newest reserves on the island. Acres of mangrove swamp cover the rocky outcrops, sheltering sandy beaches and providing a haven for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">herons</ENAMEX> and pelicans. You‚Äôll see hermit crabs scurrying across the ground, hiding in their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">shells</ENAMEX> as you approach. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Faro de Fajardo</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Fajardo lighthouse</ENAMEX>) stands amid all the greenery, protecting <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX> from the shallows to the north and east.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Isla de Vieques</ENAMEX> and Culebra
The islands of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vieques</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Culebra</ENAMEX>, off of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Rico‚Äôs east</ENAMEX> coast, are a part of, yet in many ways totally separate from, the main <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX>. The small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> here live a slower, more traditional life, and the headlong rush to get there <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX>, which you‚Äôll experience in some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX>, doesn‚Äôt seem to exist here at all.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vieques</ENAMEX> (pronounced be-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ay-kase</ENAMEX>) is the largest of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>, though its name, from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amerindian</ENAMEX>, means ‚Äúsmall <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äù It‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 11‚ÅÑ2 hours</TIMEX> by ferry from the coast, or a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30-minute</TIMEX> flight from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Isla Grande Airport</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Juan</ENAMEX>. An island of wonderful sandy beaches and farmland, it is also home to a large <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> military reserve. Regular military flights may mar the tranquillity somewhat, but they can‚<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Äôt</ENAMEX> spoil the natural beauty. Much of the land has been leased back to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> can enjoy the wonderful beaches, although you‚Äôll need some form of photo ID to gain access to them. On the south coast you‚Äôll find <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sun Bay</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 miles</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 km</NUMEX>) of fine government-run public beach (which was used as the location for the film <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lord</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Flies</ENAMEX>). Nearby is <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mosquito Bay</ENAMEX>, an appropriate name, since most of the island seems to have squadrons of the tiny winged <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">beasts</ENAMEX>. This is a phosphorescent bay, and you can take a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> trip out into the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> to agitate the microscopic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> that give off the strange glow. It‚Äôs a fascinating experience. The show is always better on <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a moonless night</TIMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isabel Segunda</ENAMEX>, named in honor of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Queen</ENAMEX> who was on the throne when work began on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">fort</ENAMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1840s</TIMEX>. Its shady <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plaza</ENAMEX> sees a constant stream of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>, but no one rushes. There‚Äôs little else to do but relax, and this is the real appeal of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vieques</ENAMEX>.
Culebra, much smaller at <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">21 sq miles</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">34 sq km</NUMEX>), is north of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vieques</ENAMEX>. It is the largest <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rock</ENAMEX> in a collection of over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty</TIMEX> that attract <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sailors</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">divers</ENAMEX> from the main <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX>. Culebra was known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virgin Island</ENAMEX> until the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">takeover¬†‚Äî¬†it</ENAMEX> lies halfway between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">St.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US Virgin Islands</ENAMEX>. Its only <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> is named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dewey</ENAMEX>, after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Admiral George Dewey</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hero</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Spanish War of 1898</ENAMEX>. The local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are more apt to call it <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pueblo</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Culebra</ENAMEX> is full of natural beauty: beaches (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Flamenco</ENAMEX> is the most celebrated), clear waters full of marine life, and land awash with <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>. Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> come just to sit on the beach or walk in the fresh air. Much of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> is now managed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">US Fish</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wildlife Service</ENAMEX>, to preserve the environment. It makes an interesting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX> trip from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX> and a total contrast to hot days in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Old San Juan</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southeast</ENAMEX>
Traveling south from Fajardo you have the option of using <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Route 53</ENAMEX> (a new toll <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>) or continuing on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Route 3</ENAMEX>. Both <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX> lead past to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Humacao</ENAMEX>, and on toward the south coast. Just south of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Humacao</ENAMEX> is a left turn for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Palmas del Mar</ENAMEX>, a growing resort area on the southeast coastline. A residential resort <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX> built around wonderful stretches of beach, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> offers numerous activities, including horseback-riding, fishing, <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">golf</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX>), and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">casino</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">East</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yabucoa</ENAMEX> you‚Äôll find the start of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ruta Panoramica</ENAMEX>. If you don‚Äôt have time to follow this entire <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">trail</ENAMEX>, at least drive along <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Route 3</ENAMEX> south of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yabucoa</ENAMEX> to the area around the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cendro la Pandura</ENAMEX> peak. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> climbs via a series of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">switchback</ENAMEX> turns, and once at the top you‚Äôll have a clear view of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> lying in the flat plain below. The lifestyle of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who live high on the hillside is fascinating. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J√≠baros</ENAMEX> (country <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX>) carry <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">machetes</ENAMEX> to the fields, accompanied by their faithful hounds. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Chickens scoot</ENAMEX> under <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> as you approach. Around every turn, you‚Äôll marvel at how the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> can be built on such precipitous slopes. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> then leads along the southern coastal plain through several small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Playa de Ponce</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ponce</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Puerto Rico‚Äôs</ENAMEX> second <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ponce</ENAMEX> is as much steeped in history as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Old San Juan</ENAMEX>. Founded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1692</TIMEX>, it was named after a relative of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Juan Ponce de Le√≥n</ENAMEX>, not the famous explorer himself. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ponce</ENAMEX> is a thriving port <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, very modern in many ways, but it lives up to its name of ‚ÄúPearl of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South</ENAMEX>.‚Äù At the very heart of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> is a jewel of an old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, well-preserved thanks to a massive and expensive restoration program begun in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1980s</TIMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Hundreds</NUMEX> of careworn <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> were brought back to life, and power cables were buried underground and out of sight. Along with this physical transformation came a cultural change: <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ponce</ENAMEX> has become a focus for social events that celebrate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Puerto Rican</ENAMEX> history and tradition; several major festivals are held here throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX>.
The focus of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parque Degetau</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Plaza Las Delicias</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Delight Square</ENAMEX>), known by most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locals</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Plaza de Ponce</ENAMEX>. Most of what you want to see is within <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a few minutes‚Äô</NUMEX> walk of this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plaza</ENAMEX>, and caf√©s and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> for refreshments are also near at hand. You can spend a wonderful <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> just soaking in the atmosphere. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>, with its shady <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>, cooling fountains, and somber bronze statues, including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n</ENAMEX>, is where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> come to take a break from the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midday</TIMEX> heat. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">There‚Äôs</ENAMEX> also a good ice-cream <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop</ENAMEX> on the east side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>.
At the heart of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cathedral</ENAMEX> of our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lady</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guadalupe</ENAMEX>, the city‚Äôs main place of worship since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 1600s</TIMEX>. Steady streams of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> step inside to light a candle. Behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">cathedral</ENAMEX> is perhaps the most famous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parque de Bombas</ENAMEX>. This small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> to the city‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">firefighters</ENAMEX> looks as though it were designed by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> and colored with crayons. Ornate wooden <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">domes</ENAMEX> sitting atop <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> turrets that are painted in the brightest red and black stripes and highlighted with brilliant yellow. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> was erected for a trade fair in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1882</TIMEX> and taken over by the bomba or firemen‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>. The displays detail the bravery of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> who fought fires in the once mostly wooden old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Casa Armstrong-Poventud</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Armstrong-Poventud House</ENAMEX>) is the west side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>. Once the family <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> of a Scottish-born <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">banker</ENAMEX> and then later sold to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Poventud</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, it‚Äôs now a cultural <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> that holds various exhibitions throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alcald√≠a</ENAMEX> (city <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX>) is also interesting. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Presidents</ENAMEX> (the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roosevelts</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herbert Hoover</ENAMEX>) delivered speeches from the balcony here. Built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1840</TIMEX>, it served as the town <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">jail</ENAMEX> until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1905</TIMEX>.
Radiating out from the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plaza</ENAMEX> are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX>, each of which with its own treasures. A number of the historic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> have been converted to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX>, but many are still residential or commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> use. Strolling along the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> you‚Äôll be able to admire the ornate <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> colonial and neoclassical fa√ßades.
On <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Calle Isabel</ENAMEX>, east of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>, you‚Äôll find the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ponce History Museum</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> was actually <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> family <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">houses¬†‚Äî¬†Casa Salazar</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Casa Zapatar¬†‚Äî¬†that</ENAMEX> were joined to make room for this fascinating collection of archive material. The exhibits document the history of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> since its founding. Photographs bring to life the changes in lifestyle over the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX>. The comprehensive information plaques are in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Spanish only</TIMEX>, but there are guided tours in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">every hour</TIMEX>.
Behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calle Cristina</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">La Perla Theater</ENAMEX>. This was one of the first neoclassical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> to be built in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1864</TIMEX>. Destroyed by an earthquake in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1910s</TIMEX>, it was rebuilt in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1940</TIMEX> and thoroughly restored as part of the major renovations of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late 1980s</TIMEX>. It is once again at the center of the cultural activity for which <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ponce</ENAMEX> is famed.
Another noteworthy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Calle Isabel</ENAMEX> is in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Casa Serrall√©s</ENAMEX>: the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Puerto Rican</ENAMEX> Music traces the complicated development of the island‚Äôs distinctive musical legacy, from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amerindian</ENAMEX> influences to the blending of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> colonial musical styles.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> that has only recently opened its doors to visitors is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Casa Wiechers Villaronga</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Calle Reina</ENAMEX>. Designed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1911</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alfredo Wiechers</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Villaronga-Mercado</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, it is full of elegant <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Art-Deco</ENAMEX> features.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ponce</ENAMEX> is a lively <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, and street <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendors</ENAMEX> can be found on every corner. The town market at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calle Atocha</ENAMEX>, one block from the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>, operates as it has done for generations. Here you‚Äôll find fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetables</ENAMEX> and fruit <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">galore</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ponce</ENAMEX> also has some surprises outside the historic <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">quarter</TIMEX>. On <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">El Vig√≠a Hill</ENAMEX>, above the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> to the north, are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> interesting attractions. One is a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>-ft (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">301‚ÅÑ2-m</ENAMEX>) high cross that overlooks the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. Known locally as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cruz del Vig√≠a</ENAMEX>, it was built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1984</TIMEX>; this concrete cross replaced a wooden <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last century</TIMEX>. There is an observation area at the point at which the arms spread; from here you can get a panoramic view over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ponce</ENAMEX> and out toward the coast.
Set just below <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cruz del Vig√≠a</ENAMEX>, one of the finest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ponce</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Castillo Serrall√©s</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Serrall√©s Castle</ENAMEX>) is not a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> but actually a spectacular family <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1930s</TIMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Serrall√</ENAMEX>©s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Don Q rum</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>. With its red-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tiled</NUMEX> roof and pastel pink exterior, the structure is a lovely example of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish Revival</ENAMEX> style. It is full of beautiful furniture owned by various family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>. The gardens have been designed in formal <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> style, with lots of carefully trimmed box <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">hedges</ENAMEX> and expansive <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">lawns</ENAMEX>; from here you can look down on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ponce</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>. Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX> has been owned by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ponce Municipal Government</ENAMEX>, which now operates it as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> and meeting center.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South</ENAMEX> of the historic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town center</ENAMEX>, on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avenue of the Americas</ENAMEX> (a modern <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">two-lane highway</ENAMEX>) is the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Museo de Arte de Ponce</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ponce Art Museum</ENAMEX>). This collection of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Puerto Rican</ENAMEX> art, probably the finest in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX>, would be very much at home in any <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> is the brainchild of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Luis Ferr√©</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">industrialist</ENAMEX> and onetime <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX>, who has put great effort into bringing works of art to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">More than 1,600</NUMEX> paintings and sculptures make up the collection, which covers <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> centuries of western art. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Flemish</ENAMEX> collection features work by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Bril</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1554‚Äì1626</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Teniers</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1610‚Äì1690</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> collection has a piece by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Greco</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1541‚Äì1614</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nicholas Maes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1632‚Äì1693</ENAMEX>) is represented in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> collection, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> include <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joshua Reynolds</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1723‚Äì1792</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Gainsborough</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1727‚Äì1788</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Romney</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1734‚Äì1802</ENAMEX>). Pride of place is taken by the painting Flaming <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June</TIMEX>, by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frederick Lord Leighton</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1830‚Äì1896</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">gallery</ENAMEX> offers a guided tour in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> every <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2pm</TIMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ponce</ENAMEX> actually sits <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">some 3 miles</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 km</NUMEX>) inland, but the local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> take every opportunity to go to the coast. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> beach is kept passably tidy by litter patrols. One spot where you‚Äôre bound to meet the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locals</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">La Guancha</ENAMEX>, a boardwalk area between the beach, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ponce Marina</ENAMEX>, and the commercial docks. It‚Äôs a great place for strolling and gazing out over the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>. There‚Äôs a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> to climb if you want a bird‚Äôs-eye view. Numerous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kiosks</ENAMEX> sell cold <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Puerto Rican snacks</ENAMEX>. The area‚Äôs always buzzing at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekends</TIMEX>.
While at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Guancha</ENAMEX> you may see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> across the narrow bay staring down into the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>. More likely than not, they‚Äôre trying to catch sight of the giant tarpon that have taken to swimming around in the shallows. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Hundreds</NUMEX> of these <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish¬†‚Äî¬†some</ENAMEX> are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to 7</NUMEX> ft (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 m</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">long¬†‚Äî¬†congregate</ENAMEX> here because they‚Äôve learned they‚Äôll be well supplied with tasty tidbits offered by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> on shore.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North of Ponce</ENAMEX> are attractions of a different kind. Take <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Route 503</ENAMEX> out of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">town¬†‚Äî¬†this road</ENAMEX> runs along the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">R√≠o Portugu√©z¬†‚Äî¬†and</ENAMEX> after <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about a mile and a half</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 km</NUMEX>) you‚Äôll arrive at the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tibes Indian Ceremonial Park</ENAMEX>, one of the most important <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amerindian</ENAMEX> archaeological sites in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX>. The ceremonial site and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cemetery</ENAMEX> are across the river, and you may not enter without a guide. A small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> explains the known history of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Amerindian</ENAMEX> races; it has a number of cabinets holding artifacts, as well as a skeleton, still in the traditional fetal burial position. Once you‚Äôre into the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>, the ceremonial grounds come into view. Open spaces discovered since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s</TIMEX> are now believed to be used for ‚Äúball games,‚Äù which had an important though as yet only poorly understood ceremonial purpose in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> culture.
High in the hills behind <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ponce</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hacienda Buena Vista</ENAMEX>. To get there, take <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Route 10</ENAMEX>, a major north-south <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">artery</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> climbs steeply into dense vegetation and cooler air before you see signs for the hacienda; the climate and environmental conditions here were ideal for the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plantation</ENAMEX> began to grow <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than 150 years ago</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plantation</ENAMEX> fell into neglect in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 20th century</TIMEX>, but since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1984</TIMEX> it has been returned to its original <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Conservation Trust of Puerto Rico</ENAMEX>. Agricultural machinery such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bean huskers</ENAMEX> can be seen in the original <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>, and the water <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mill</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canals</ENAMEX>, which harnessed the power of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canas River</ENAMEX>, are now in working order. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> shows how <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plantations</ENAMEX> used to operate and offer a fascinating insight into agricultural life in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX> all those <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX>. Advance reservations are required for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">tours</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">64</NUMEX>).
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southwest</ENAMEX>
West of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ponce</ENAMEX> there are a number of bosques estatales (state forests) and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">acres</NUMEX> of farmland with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">grazing cattle</ENAMEX> and commercial stables. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rainfall</ENAMEX> is much lighter here than in the east, and the forests are more temperate than tropical.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bosque Estatal de Gu√°nica</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gu√°nica State Forest</ENAMEX>), on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">south coast</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ponce</ENAMEX>, is one of the largest tracts of tropical dry forest in the world. The fascinating rocky landscape is home to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of cacti and other desert <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 700</NUMEX> species all together). Named a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Biosphere Reserve</ENAMEX>, the area includes several sandy beaches. To see the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> at its best, though, take the inland route (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Route 334</ENAMEX>) rather than the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">coast</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>. There is too much evidence of human activity on the beaches; the litter and burned-out <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> spoil some of the beautiful views.
Further east along <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Route 116</ENAMEX> you‚Äôll reach <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">La Parguera</ENAMEX>, a small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> on the south coast surrounded by <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">thousands of acres</NUMEX> of mangroves. A pretty <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> with a seaside atmosphere, it is a popular vacation spot for city-dwelling <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Ricans</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the most enticing activities in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">La Parguera</ENAMEX> is exploring the mangroves (some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tunnels</ENAMEX> are <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">hundreds of yards</NUMEX> deep) and the small offshore islands where you can picnic, swim, and snorkel <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all day</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX> offshore are full of sea-life and wonderfully clear. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rental</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> are available.)
Just east of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Parguera</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Phosphorescent Bay</ENAMEX>, known for its glowing water filled with micro-organisms. Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</TIMEX> many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> have built houseboats on the margins of the mangrove, and this has caused problems for the sensitive environment of the bay. The situation is said to be improving now, as new environmental controls are being put into place.
Heading west beyond <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">La Parguera</ENAMEX>, you‚Äôll need to use secondary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX>, but these are in surprisingly good condition and relatively quiet. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">It‚Äôs</ENAMEX> almost a pampas landscape here, with grassy slopes and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses galore</ENAMEX>. Boquer√≥n, a small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> on the west coast, has arguably the most beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">balneario</ENAMEX> (public beach) on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX>, a long arc of fine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sand</ENAMEX> backed by sea <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">grapes</ENAMEX> and palm <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>. The settlement is growing due to its popularity, and a new marina is taking shape, but it still retains the feel of its origins as a fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX>. When the catches arrive, small temporary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stalls</ENAMEX> are set up around the tiny town <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>. You can buy fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">clams</ENAMEX> and oysters, which can be shucked for you to eat as you go. There are a few small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> here, which soon fill up on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekends</TIMEX> and holidays, but if you arrive <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">midweek</TIMEX> or out of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX>, you may find that you are the only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South of Boquer√≥n</ENAMEX> you leave the world behind. Make your way along <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Route 301</ENAMEX> towards <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Cabo Rojo and the lighthouse</ENAMEX> at the southwest tip of the island to really enjoy natural <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX>. Fishing is the main way <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> make a living <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">here¬†‚Äî¬†between mangrove</ENAMEX> outcrops are many small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shacks</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> tied up to rickety wooden jetties. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt flats</ENAMEX> that you see are still harvested commercially. Eventually, the tarmac stops and the road changes to a simple dirt <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">track</ENAMEX>. The surface is reasonable, so don‚Äôt worry about continuing on. You‚Äôll travel over a narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX> and enter a section of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Bosque Estatal de Boquer√≥n</ENAMEX>. Leave you car below the lighthouse and walk up the hill to reach it (a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five-minute</TIMEX> walk for the reasonably fit). Turn around as you climb the hill, and a wonderful sandy bay will open out in front of you. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pelicans</ENAMEX> play and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">feed</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">frigate birds</ENAMEX> wheel in the sky above.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Faro de Cabo Rojo</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Cabo Rojo Lighthouse</ENAMEX>) has been sadly neglected, but the light still plays an important part in protecting shipping off the island. It sits atop some of the highest cliffs on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX>, a truly spectacular sight. But beware of going too close to the edge, as there are no fences here.
Inland from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">La Parguera</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boquer√≥n</ENAMEX> is pretty <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Germ√°n</ENAMEX>, once also set on the coast but moved inland after the original site was sacked several times. Built on an undulating hillside, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> is the epitome of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> colonial style. Its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> squares have not yet been spoiled by neon fast-food signs. There‚Äôs much of architectural interest around the pretty promenades and grand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>. Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">200</TIMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> are under protection, but unfortunately, as yet, there is no tourist information <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, and many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> are neither identified nor open to the public. Just enjoy the beautiful views and stroll along the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> to take in all the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">detail</ENAMEX>.
The major building of importance here is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iglesia Porta Coeli</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Church of the Gate</ENAMEX> of Heaven), a tiny terra-cotta chapel and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">convent</ENAMEX> founded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1606</TIMEX>. It sits in the lower of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">two</NUMEX> squares in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>. The heart of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the most important religious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> on the island in its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early years</TIMEX>, it was later used as a schoolhouse and poorhouse before being handed over to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1949</TIMEX>. After renovations in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1960</TIMEX>, it was opened to the public. The new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> includes the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museo de Arte Religioso</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum of Religious Art</ENAMEX>), which features a collection of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Puerto Rican santos</ENAMEX>, carved religious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">figures</ENAMEX> and icons.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North of Boquer√≥n</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mayag√ºez</ENAMEX>, the major urban center of the west coast and the end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ruta Panoramica</ENAMEX>. The old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> was destroyed in an earthquake in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1918</TIMEX>; as a result, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mayag√</ENAMEX>ºez is less interesting in terms of architecture than other settlements. It is, however, a popular base from which to explore the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">west coast</ENAMEX> (there are frequent direct flights between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mayag√ºez</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Juan</ENAMEX>). A number of large international <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> offer a good standard of accommodation and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">golf</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">casinos</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Puerto Rico‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">campus</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mayag√ºez</ENAMEX> has an internationally recognized <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tropical Agriculture Research Center</ENAMEX>, which, among other activities, cultivates <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several hundred</NUMEX> tropical <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> is open to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX>, but since it has no refreshment <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> or play areas for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, it‚Äôs for dedicated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gardeners</ENAMEX> only.
<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Fifty miles</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">80 km</NUMEX>) off the coast is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mona Island</ENAMEX>, called <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚Äúthe Galapagos</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX>.‚Äù This isolated place, characterized by a coastline of high cliffs, is home to <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">turtles</ENAMEX>, iguanas, and endangered <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pelicans</ENAMEX>. There is no human settlement <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, but there is evidence that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ta√≠no Indians</ENAMEX> once lived here. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbus</ENAMEX> is also said to have landed, as did <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ponce de Le√≥n</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Camping</ENAMEX> trips of the ‚Äúcommune-with nature‚Äù variety can be arranged from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mayag√ºez.</ENAMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest</ENAMEX>
The northwest of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX> is the surfing capital of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Antilles</ENAMEX>, with great waves rising offshore. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inland</ENAMEX> is some of the most beautiful and undeveloped karst landscape anywhere. The region produces most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Puerto Rican</ENAMEX> coffee <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crop</ENAMEX>, once the only coffee drunk in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Vatican</ENAMEX>.
Once north of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mayag√ºez</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> west on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Route 115</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rinc√≥n</ENAMEX>. This small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> and low-key <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> is the surfing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> for all the beaches along the coast. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">North</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Punta Higuaro</ENAMEX>, one of the most popular beaches, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Faro de Rinc√≥n</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Rinc√≥n Lighthouse</ENAMEX>). This warning <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX>, which is surrounded by a neat <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> area with a caf√© and gift <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop</ENAMEX>, makes an ideal platform for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">whale</ENAMEX>-watching. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Groups</ENAMEX> of the leviathans pass here on their migrations. Telescopes allow you to scan the horizon for their watery exhalations.
Farther north along the coast, just south of the small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aguada</ENAMEX>, is a monument commemorating the landing of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crist√≥bal Col√≥n</ENAMEX> on the island in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1493</TIMEX>. Though no one is really sure of the precise landing site (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Columbus</ENAMEX> is renowned for having been less than accurate in documenting his landing sites), the small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> with its column and na√Øve paintings depicting <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">colonization</ENAMEX> serves its purpose well.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aguadilla</ENAMEX>, traveling out toward the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rafael Hernandez</ENAMEX> air force base, are a series of fine bathing and surfing beaches. The most famous is <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Crash Boat Beach</ENAMEX>, named after a shipwreck that happened just offshore. The beach is always busy, but the most exciting stretch is the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">northern</ENAMEX> section, where the fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> rest. Most <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours of the morning</TIMEX> there are <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX> coming ashore with their meager, but extremely fresh, catch. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> are brightly colored and carefully tended to ensure that they are always in peak condition¬†‚Äî¬†not one is splintered or sun-bleached.
Traveling back along the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">northern</ENAMEX> coast there is little to draw the eye. Inland however, it‚Äôs a different story. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South</ENAMEX> of the busy <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arecibo</ENAMEX> are a number of attractions that would make a fine day-trip from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Juan</ENAMEX> (none is more than a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">90-minute</TIMEX> drive from the capital).
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Route 129</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Arecibo</ENAMEX> leads to one of the most important and mysterious scientific instruments in the world. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arecibo Observatory</ENAMEX> has the largest single-dish radio telescope in the world; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,000</NUMEX> ft (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">305 m</ENAMEX>) in diameter, it has been silently scanning the universe, making maps of distant solar systems, and listening for messages from other planets since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1960</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Observatory</ENAMEX> is part of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cornell University‚Äôs National Astronomy</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Ionosphere Center</ENAMEX>; it operates <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours a day</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">center</ENAMEX> likes to emphasize the serious scientific work it undertakes¬†‚Äî¬†such as detecting extremely weak radio pulses from the very corners of the known universe, which take <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">100 million years</TIMEX> to reach the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">earth</ENAMEX>. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> are more impressed by the fact that the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">observatory</ENAMEX> was used for location shots in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Bond</ENAMEX> film <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goldeneye</ENAMEX> and, more recently, in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Contact</ENAMEX>, starring <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jodie Foster</ENAMEX>. A viewing platform allows you to look down on the massive dish, and in the education <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">center</ENAMEX>, opened in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> can undertake simple and safe experiments to learn more about physics and the solar system.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Observatory</ENAMEX> sits in the heart of karst <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, a region of archetypal limestone erosion. Wave upon wave of small smooth hillocks known as ‚Äúhaystacks‚Äù cover the land, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX> bend and weave around these forested mounds and through small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">villages nestled</ENAMEX> in the valleys. The name <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚Äúkarst‚Äù</ENAMEX> is taken from a region of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yugoslavia</ENAMEX> that has these same geographical characteristics. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> striking feature of all karst landscapes is that the erosion of the limestone layers by rainwater creates cave systems, where weaker rock is worn away from under stronger rock that remains intact. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX> has one of the most dramatic cave systems yet discovered, in an area known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parque de las Cavernas del R√≠o Camuy</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">R√≠o Camuy Cave Park</ENAMEX>), a little way south of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Observatory</ENAMEX>, just off <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Route 129</ENAMEX>. Tourist trains carry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> between the caves and sinkholes (deep vertical shafts created when cave roofs collapse) that make up the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>. A long video (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> only) shows what to expect before you set out. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">giant</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cueva Clara</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Clara Cave</ENAMEX>) is reached by descending into a sinkhole; once in its depths, a narrow entrance leads to a cavern of cathedral-like <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dimensions¬†‚Äî¬†it</ENAMEX> is said the largest section of the cave could hold the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">El Morro fort</ENAMEX>. The caves and sinkholes have taken <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> to erode; many of the stalagmites and stalactites have been <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds of thousands</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> in formation. An underground river, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">R√≠o Camuy</ENAMEX>, is responsible for much of the work. It still flows <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, enlarging its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">path</ENAMEX> through the rock.
The whole <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cave park</ENAMEX> is a truly awesome sight, with holes 300 ft (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">91</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX>) deep and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> ft (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">61</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX>) across, and caves <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">thousands of feet</NUMEX> deep, all surrounded by pristine forest. Some say that the fountain of youth is here, in the clean <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> filtering through the limestone from the surface. You don‚Äôt have to believe the legends, but taste the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water anyway¬†‚Äî¬†it‚</ENAMEX>Äôs very sweet, and it can‚Äôt hurt to wish just a little.
From the caves it‚Äôs a short drive to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lares</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">island‚Äôs center</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX> production. The sweet <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">brew</ENAMEX> made from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Puerto Rican beans</ENAMEX> is considered one of the finest in the world, though production is small. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coffee</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>, usually interspersed with other <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crops</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bananas</ENAMEX> or plantains, can be seen growing on the high hillsides; it is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crop</ENAMEX> that enjoys good drainage and lots of humidity, which the large <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">banana</ENAMEX> leaves help to conserve.
From <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lares</ENAMEX> take <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Route 111</ENAMEX> to reach the most important <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amerindian</ENAMEX> site on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Parque Ceremonial Ind√≠gena Caguana</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Caguana Indian Ceremonial Park</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> is set in a wide valley surrounded by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">limestone</TIMEX> peaks, one of which is said to represent the supreme god of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ta√≠nos.</ENAMEX> The several ceremonial ball <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX> discovered and excavated here suggest the site was one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indians‚</ENAMEX>Äô major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> of worship. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ta√</ENAMEX>≠nos were still living happily on the island when <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Columbus</ENAMEX> arrived in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1493</TIMEX>; archaeological finds here date back to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1200</TIMEX> b.c. The ball <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX>, edged with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">stones¬†‚Äî¬†some</ENAMEX> with symbols carved on <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">them¬†‚Äî¬†are</ENAMEX> set in fine gardens planted with many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">native</ENAMEX> tree <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>. A small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> displays pottery and other artifacts found at the site.
From <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arecibo</ENAMEX> on the coast, it‚Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">an hour</NUMEX> along the fast <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Route 22</ENAMEX> toll <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Juan</ENAMEX>. Many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> along the way are small industrial outposts for the suburbs of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cata√±o</ENAMEX>. Just before reaching the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, however, is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> that is developing into an important <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">provider</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitor</ENAMEX> accommodations. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dorado</ENAMEX> has several large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort hotels</ENAMEX>, all of which occupy private grounds near the pretty sandy beaches. These are self-contained <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX>, with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> such as golf <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX> and night-time entertainment. There is however, little tourist infrastructure in the immediate vicinity. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dorado</ENAMEX>, with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">21‚ÅÑ2 miles</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4 km</NUMEX>) from the nearest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX> along the strip. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dorado</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">resort area</ENAMEX> began life as a large <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plantation</ENAMEX>, owned by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Livingston</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>; the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX> built <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">here¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hyatt Dorado Beach Hotel¬</ENAMEX>†‚Äî¬†incorporated the old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plantation house</ENAMEX> into its original design.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Excursion</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Thomas</ENAMEX>
The shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mecca</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">St.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas</ENAMEX> is the most densely populated of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US Virgin Islands</ENAMEX> (the others are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. John</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. Croix</ENAMEX>). Easily reached from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Juan¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†just a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">40-minute</TIMEX> flight from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Mu√±oz Mar√≠n International Airport¬†‚Äî¬†St</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas</ENAMEX> has become a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚Äúmust-visit‚</NUMEX>Äù <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> for many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. It‚Äôs a duty-free haven, where luxury goods can be <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40%</NUMEX> cheaper than at home. This is particularly advantageous to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX>, who can claim an allowance of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1,200</NUMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>, regardless of age. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Puerto Ricans</ENAMEX> hop across for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX>, to take advantage of the bargains. During the flight over from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Juan</ENAMEX>, you‚Äôll be able to get a bird‚Äôs-eye view of most of the neighboring <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">British Virgin Islands</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charlotte Amalie</ENAMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">St.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Charlotte Amalie</ENAMEX> (pronounced <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚Äúamahlia‚Äù</ENAMEX>), sits on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the finest natural harbors in the world. Named by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Danish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">settlers</ENAMEX> after the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christian V</ENAMEX>, the settlement started out as a trading <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port</ENAMEX> (a tradition that continues with great success <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>). The downtown area, resting between the surrounding hills and the harbor, is a warren of old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> and red roofs best seen from above. One lasting legacy of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Danish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">colonization</ENAMEX> is the street names.
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Warehouses</ENAMEX> built along the harbor by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17th- and 18th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Danish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">merchants</ENAMEX> still play host to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX>. But now, instead of stocking such staples as <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">cotton</ENAMEX>, flour, or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> are filled with the modern version of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äúpirate booty‚Äù¬†‚Äî¬†gold</ENAMEX>, gems, watches, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designer</ENAMEX> goods. The main shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> lie close to the waterfront. A series of narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">alleys</ENAMEX> are filled with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">craft</ENAMEX>, clothing, and jewelry <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, along with caf√©s and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> that provide welcome relief once you‚Äôve become ‚Äúshopped out.‚Äù
But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Charlotte Amalie</ENAMEX> is not just a shopper‚Äôs paradise. There are historic gems to be discovered here as well. Perhaps the most prominent is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fort Christian</ENAMEX>, which sits to the east of downtown. Work on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">fort</ENAMEX> began in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1671</TIMEX>, to protect the harbor. The terra-cotta walls, pretty painted shutters, and crenellated clock <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> give the building a cozy rather than a fearsome look. The interior has been transformed into a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> of life in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US Virgin Islands</ENAMEX>: colonial furniture, archive documents, and old photographs of the islands, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX>. Take a walk onto the walls of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">fort</ENAMEX> for a wonderful view over the seafront and the colorful <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Vendors Plaza</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">craft</ENAMEX> market under bright parasols that has a permanent <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> in the fort‚Äôs shadow.
Next to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">fort</ENAMEX> is the pretty <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legislature</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> with a classical fa√ßade painted bright lime green. Finished in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1874</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> was originally used as a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">barracks</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> based at the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">fort</ENAMEX>. Behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">fort</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Vendors Plaza</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Emancipation Park</ENAMEX>, perhaps the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> place in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> where you can sit in the shade of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> and enjoy the cooling sea breeze after your sightseeing and shopping. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> was named to commemorate the freeing of the slaves in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1848</TIMEX>. Across <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tolbod Gade</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tourist Information Office</ENAMEX>, where you can pick up maps and other information. On the northern corner of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tolbod Gade</ENAMEX> is the main <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">post office</ENAMEX>. Make your way in that direction, but don‚Äôt be tempted to turn right and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> just yet. Take the steps to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kongens Gade</ENAMEX>, which is the street behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lutheran Church</ENAMEX>. The steps climb onto the steep hill that has many of the oldest and most important <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Danish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Charlotte Amalie</ENAMEX>. The family <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">merchants</ENAMEX> and civil <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">servants</ENAMEX> where built high on this rise¬<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">†‚Äî¬†named Government Hill¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†to take advantage of the cooling breeze. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kongens Gade</ENAMEX> itself has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> dating back to the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late 18th</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 19th centuries</TIMEX>. Hotel <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1829</TIMEX>, named for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> in which it was built, sits amid other fine <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX>. Walk past <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hotel 1829</ENAMEX> and pause at the steps beside it, which climb higher onto <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Government Hill</ENAMEX>. These are the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">99</NUMEX> Steps, one of a series built by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Danes</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid 1700s</TIMEX> to allow pedestrian access to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> below. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">99</NUMEX> Steps are the longest in town, but whoever named the flight must have become tired toward <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">miscounted¬†‚Äî¬†there</ENAMEX> are in fact 103.
Before climbing the steps, make a small detour farther along <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Kongens Gade</ENAMEX>, past the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lutheran Parsonage</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1725</TIMEX>), to reach <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Government House</ENAMEX>, an archetypal colonial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansion</ENAMEX>. Now the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Governor</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USVIs</ENAMEX>, this <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1867</TIMEX> structure was originally used for meetings of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Danish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colonial Council</ENAMEX>; it was totally renovated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1974</TIMEX>. Nearby is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seven Arches House Museum</ENAMEX>, once the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">home</ENAMEX> of a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Danish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">master</ENAMEX> craftsman. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX> has a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúwelcoming arms‚Äù staircase¬†‚Äî¬†fashionable</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">18th</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">century¬†‚Äî¬†leading</ENAMEX> to the entrance. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Renovated</ENAMEX> and filled with period furniture, walking through it is a step back in time.
Retrace your route to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">99</NUMEX> Steps and climb to the summit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Government Hill</ENAMEX>. At the top, just when you may feel in need of a rest, you‚Äôll find <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Haagensen House</ENAMEX>, another renovated period property. Its original <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owner</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hans Haagensen</ENAMEX>, was a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Danish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">banker</ENAMEX>. Those who don‚Äôt want to climb the steps can take a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">shuttle</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Haagensen House</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pampered Pirate</ENAMEX> gift <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Norre Gade</ENAMEX>. The remains of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Blackbeard‚Äôs Castle¬†‚Äî¬†said</ENAMEX> to be the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">home</ENAMEX> of the famous pirate, whose real name was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward Teach¬†‚Äî¬†can</ENAMEX> also be seen here.
Perhaps one of the most beautiful and unusual <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Charlotte Amalie</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">St.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Synagogue</ENAMEX>, on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crystal Gade</ENAMEX>. This is the oldest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">synagogue</ENAMEX> building in continual use under the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> flag. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">congregation</ENAMEX> has always been strong here, from the very earliest <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Danish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">settlement</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1655</TIMEX>. When the all-consuming fire of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1831</TIMEX> broke out, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">64</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> were worshipping in the small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">synagogue</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scroll</ENAMEX> could be saved before the flames destroyed the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>. The present <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> was built on the same spot and opened in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1833</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">synagogue</ENAMEX> has sand on the floor, symbolic of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> flight from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX>.
The cruise <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX> is situated at the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">West Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Company Dock</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a mile</NUMEX> or so east of town. The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX><TIMEX TYPE="TIME">-minute</TIMEX> walk around the harbor is pleasant if the traffic is not too busy. Those who want to ride will find numerous <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">taxis</ENAMEX> waiting to take them to and from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Charlotte Amalie</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dock</ENAMEX> is one of the largest, and busiest, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX>. Old <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Danish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">warehouses</ENAMEX> along the dockside have been transformed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX>, creating <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Havensight Shopping Mall</ENAMEX>. Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">80</TIMEX> tax-free <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boutiques</ENAMEX> with caf√©s and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> sit <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only feet</NUMEX> away from the huge <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX>. You will also find the ticket <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Atlantis Submarine</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Havensight Mall</ENAMEX>. This <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mini-submarine</ENAMEX>, which seats around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX>, takes you some <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">60 ft</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">18‚ÄÇm</ENAMEX>) under the sea to view coral reefs and the marine life that inhabits them. A ferry takes you out to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Buck Island</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">some 3 miles</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 km</NUMEX>) offshore to rendezvous with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sub</ENAMEX>, which then submerges to spend <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about an hour</TIMEX> exploring the reef around the island. Shoals of yellow-tailed snapper surround the machine, along with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sharks</ENAMEX>, rays, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">turtles</ENAMEX>. It is great fun for young and old alike and a safe way to see the underwater world.
Beside the cruise <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Flag Hill</ENAMEX>, rising <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">700 ft</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">214 m</ENAMEX>) above sea level. From here you can enjoy the panoramic views over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Charlotte Amalie</ENAMEX>, the surrounding hills, and the harbor. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paradise Point Tramway</ENAMEX> has been built to carry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> to a platform, which is ideal for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">photographers</ENAMEX>. The <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">seven-minute</TIMEX> journey to the top gives a clear view of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Havensight</ENAMEX> and the cruise <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX> and there are is a caf√©/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX> in case you want to stop for refreshment.
Around the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Island</ENAMEX>
Like most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virgin Islands</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">St.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas</ENAMEX> is full of hills. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX> twist and turn around sharp bends and roll up and over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">undulations</TIMEX>. To see the main attractions of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">St.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas</ENAMEX> it‚Äôs best to head directly north up into the hills; you‚Äôll be able to enjoy the beautiful views back towards <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Charlotte</ENAMEX> Amalie along the way. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Drake‚Äôs Seat</ENAMEX>, thought to mark the spot where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis Drake</ENAMEX> sat and watched <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX> moving to and from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Juan</ENAMEX>, offers breathtaking views of the northern coastline and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Magens Bay</ENAMEX>, the site of what is probably the best beach on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">St.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas</ENAMEX>, and one of the most famous in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX>. Estate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">St.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Greathouse</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Botanical Gardens</ENAMEX> takes <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">up 11 acres</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">41‚ÅÑ2 hectares</NUMEX>) along the ridge top near the summit of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">St. Peter</ENAMEX> peak. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">estate</ENAMEX> was established in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1800s</TIMEX> and was owned in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1930s</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virgin Islands</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Governor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawrence Cramer</ENAMEX>. Both the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and the gardens were totally destroyed by <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Hurricane Hugo</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> they are back to their beautiful best, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX> has been restored to combine history with modern amenities. The observation <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">deck</ENAMEX> around the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> is the perfect perch from which to admire the view. If you‚Äôre feeling more energetic, follow the nature trail through the garden.
At nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Mountain Top¬†‚Äî¬†1</ENAMEX>,547 ft (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">472 m</ENAMEX>) above the bay, and higher than <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Drake‚Äôs Seat¬†‚Äî¬†you‚Äôll</ENAMEX> find a sophisticated shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mall</ENAMEX> and large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX> area with almost non-stop daiquiris (they claim to have invented the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">banana</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daiquiri</ENAMEX> here). Everyone comes with a camera, so you may have to wait a while to get a shot of the view.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Magens Bay</ENAMEX> is a beautiful stretch of sand with a slight kink in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>, which gives it the epithet ‚Äúheart-shaped.‚Äù Because it is so sheltered, it‚Äôs a safe place for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> to swim and for everyone to snorkel, though it can get very busy. In the rolling hillside behind the beach is <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Mahogany Run Golf Course</ENAMEX>, so you could have a round in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX> and swim and snorkel in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the afternoon</TIMEX>.
On the eastern end of the island, amid a number of large hotel <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX>, is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Coki Point</ENAMEX>, a pleasant beach. At the end of the point is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coral World</ENAMEX>, which offers a fascinating look at life under the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>. The attraction <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> around a number of different controlled marine environments, each with its own <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>. Watch out for the sting-ray, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">shark</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">turtle</ENAMEX> pools, where regular feeding times are posted; you‚Äôll even get a chance to pet some of the exhibits. Pride of place at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coral World</ENAMEX> must go to the genuine coral reef, which has been implanted in the open water offshore. An underground viewing area reached via a walkway allows you to observe the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> activity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">reef fish</ENAMEX> and some of the larger wild <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">creatures</ENAMEX> who swim in for the free food provided by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coral World</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Coki Beach</ENAMEX> is popular spot for snorkelers, simply because there is so much sea-life here, thanks to the regular feedings provided by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coral World</ENAMEX> around their reef. Many of the cruise <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships bus</ENAMEX> their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> in here for snorkeling so it can get busy, but you are almost always guaranteed a good show of marine life.
