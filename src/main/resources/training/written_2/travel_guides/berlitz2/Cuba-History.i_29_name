A Brief History
When <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Christopher Columbus</ENAMEX> disembarked on eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27 October 1492</TIMEX>, he quickly penned a note exclaiming that the land was â€œthe most lovely that eyes have ever seen.â€ <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tribes</ENAMEX> including the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Siboney</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South America</ENAMEX> had lived on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least 1000</TIMEX> b.c.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1511</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diego de VelÃ</ENAMEX>¡zquez sailed from neighboring <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hispaniola</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">some 300 conquistadores</NUMEX> (conquerors). Baracoa became the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">settlements</ENAMEX> across <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">VelÃ¡zquez</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">followers</ENAMEX> enslaved the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">native</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peoples</ENAMEX> and in the process exposed them to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> diseases. Whole <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> committed suicide, and by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-1500s</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> had declined from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 100,000 to 3,000</NUMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Piracy and Trade</ENAMEX>
Until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the 16th century</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX> remained a fairly insignificant <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port cities</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Havana</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santiago de Cuba</ENAMEX> were heavily fortified to defend against <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">pirate raids</ENAMEX>. Considerable contraband trade originated from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX> around the island.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1762</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> captured <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Havana</ENAMEX>. They held it for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">only a year</TIMEX> before returning it to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> in exchange for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX>, but during this period trade was opened up to additional markets, notably the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">North American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX>. A lucrative tobacco industry had taken hold in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX>, and after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1763</TIMEX> the sugar-cane business skyrocketed. Though <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">settlers</ENAMEX> brought the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> slaves to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1500s</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds of thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">laborers</ENAMEX> were imported in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 18th century</TIMEX> to meet the demands of the sugar industry.
By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the middle of the 19th century</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX> produced a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">worldâ€™s sugar</ENAMEX> and was considered one of the most valuable <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> in the world. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Half a million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">slavesÂ â€”Â nearly</ENAMEX> half the populationÂ â€”Â worked the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plantations</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 3,500</NUMEX> trading <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX> visited <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annually</TIMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Road to Independence</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Spaniards</ENAMEX> born and raised in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX>, known as criollos (creoles), managed the sugar-cane <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plantations</ENAMEX> but were not involved in the running of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th century</TIMEX> some criollos (particularly in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oriente</ENAMEX>, the islandâ€™s poorer, eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX>) became increasingly disenchanted and desired greater autonomy.
On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 October 1868</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carlos Manuel de CÃ©spedes</ENAMEX>, a criollo plantation <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owner</ENAMEX> who had already had a brief role in uprisings in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>, issued a call for independence and liberated slaves from his estate, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">La Demajagua</ENAMEX>. During the subsequent <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Ten Yearsâ€™ War</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1868â€“78</ENAMEX>) <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CubansÂ â€”Â including CÃ©spedesÂ â€”Â</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 200,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> lost their lives. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX> remained a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>, but the war contributed to the abolition of slavery on the island in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1886</TIMEX> and planted the seeds of a national consciousness.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1895</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">JosÃ© MartÃ­</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cubaâ</ENAMEX>€™s most venerated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patriot</ENAMEX> (who now has a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>, or building named after him in every <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>), led the next and most important uprising against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>. Born in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1853</TIMEX> and exiled at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> for his political views, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MartÃ­</ENAMEX> became a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalist</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poet</ENAMEX>. From exile in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> he argued for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cuban</ENAMEX> independence. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">MartÃ­</ENAMEX> was killed in an ambush during the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">War</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Independence</ENAMEX>, which began in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1895</TIMEX> and in which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 300,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cubans</ENAMEX> died.
Throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th century</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, keenly interested in the islandâ€™s strategic significance and its sugar market, had become increasingly involved in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cuban</ENAMEX> affairs. A <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> purchase of the island from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> had long been on the agenda, even though <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MartÃ­</ENAMEX> had warned of becoming a satellite of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> (â€œI know the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Monster</ENAMEX>, because I have lived in its lair,â€ he wrote).
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February 1898</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.S. Maine</ENAMEX> was sunk in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Havanaâ€™s</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">harbor</ENAMEX>, killing all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">260</NUMEX> crew <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>. Although <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> responsibility was never incontrovertibly established, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> used the sinking as a pretext to declare war. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US</ENAMEX> victory came swiftly, with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> surrendering claim to the island by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the same year</TIMEX>. A provisional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">military government</ENAMEX> lasted to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1902</TIMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX> became an independent <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">republic</ENAMEX>.
False Independence
For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next five decades</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, the largest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">importer</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cuban</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sugar</ENAMEX>, dominated the islandâ€™s economy and largely controlled its political processes. The period was rife with political corruption, violence, and terrorism. After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1933</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fulgencio Batista</ENAMEX>, though only a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sergeant</ENAMEX>, orchestrated the strings of power through a series of puppet <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">presidents</ENAMEX> before winning the presidency outright in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1940</TIMEX>. He retired in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1944</TIMEX> but returned by staging a military coup in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1952</TIMEX>. His venal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">dictatorship</ENAMEX> made it possible for him to invest <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">some $300 million</NUMEX> abroad by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1959</TIMEX>.
Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1920s</TIMEX> disillusionment with the nascent republicÂ â€”Â with its clear dependence on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> and its lack of political probity or social equalityÂ â€”Â had grown steadily. Although <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX> had the second-highest per capita income in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latin America</ENAMEX>, prosperity did not filter down from the upper classes. In fact, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Bank</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1950</TIMEX> declared <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as many as 60 percent</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cubans</ENAMEX> undernourished. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Havana</ENAMEX> there was a greater concentration of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">millionaires</ENAMEX> than anywhere else in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Central</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South America</ENAMEX>, and the capital was dubbed <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œan</ENAMEX> offshore <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Las Vegasâ€</ENAMEX> for its brothels, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">casinos</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gangsters</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Road to Revolution</ENAMEX>
On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26 July 1953</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rebels</ENAMEX> attacked the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moncada Barracks</ENAMEX> (the countryâ€™s <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> most important military <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base</ENAMEX>) in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santiago de Cuba</ENAMEX>. The assault was a failure, but it thrust into the limelight its young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fidel Castro</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Castro</ENAMEX> was imprisoned and put on trial; his legendary <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two-hour</TIMEX> defense speech, later published as <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">History Will Absolve Me</ENAMEX>, became a revolutionary manifesto. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Castro</ENAMEX> was incarcerated on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Isle of Pines</ENAMEX> (now called the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Isla de la Juventud</ENAMEX>) until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 1955</TIMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Batista</ENAMEX> granted an amnesty to political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prisoners</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Castro</ENAMEX> then fled to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">The following year</TIMEX> he returned to southeastern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX> with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">81</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guerrillas</ENAMEX> (including <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Che Guevara</ENAMEX>) crammed onto a small <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">yacht</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Granma</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only 15</NUMEX> reached the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sierra Maestra</ENAMEX> mountains safely. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Incredibly</ENAMEX>, from such inauspicious beginnings the so-called <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">â€œ26</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July</TIMEX> Movementâ€ grew into a serious guerrilla <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX>, aided in no small part by local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peasants</ENAMEX> who were promised land reform.
Following a disastrous offensive by government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> on the rebelsâ€™ mountain <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">strongholds</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1958</TIMEX>, on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 January 1959</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Batista</ENAMEX> fled the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dominican Republic</ENAMEX>. The barbudos (the bearded ones) triumphantly entered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santiago</ENAMEX>, then marched into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Havana</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one week later</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Castroâ€™s Cuba</ENAMEX>
Castroâ€™s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">fledgling government</ENAMEX> immediately ordered rents reduced, new wage levels set, and estates limited in size to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">390 hectares</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">966 acres</NUMEX>). A comprehensive nationalization program followed, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> expropriated <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factories</ENAMEX>, utilities, and more land. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">foundations</ENAMEX> were set for near-universal state employment. At the same time, the new government instituted sweeping, enlightened programs to eradicate illiteracy and provide free universal schooling and health care.
A centralized, all-powerful state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">didnâ€™t</ENAMEX> please all <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cubans</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> were soon placed under state control, promised elections were never held, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Committees</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense of the Revolution</ENAMEX> (CDRs) were established to keep tabs on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dissenters</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early years</TIMEX> of the revolution, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tens of thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> suspected of being unsympathetic to its goals were detained, imprisoned, or sent to labor <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camps</ENAMEX>, along with such other <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">â€œundesirablesâ€</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homosexuals</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priests</ENAMEX>.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Between 1959 and 1962</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 200,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cubans</ENAMEX>, primarily <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX> and affluent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">landowners</ENAMEX>, fled the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Expatriate Cubans</ENAMEX> settled in nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX>, establishing a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX> that would steadily gain in political and economic power. Another <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200,000</NUMEX> abandoned <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX> as part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Freedom Flights Program</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1965 and 1971</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">125,000Â â€”Â</NUMEX> a good number of whom were said to be criminalsÂ â€”Â followed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1980</TIMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Castro</ENAMEX> lifted travel restrictions from the port of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mariel</ENAMEX> (west of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Havana</ENAMEX>).
According to official <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> estimates, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX> lost <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$8 billion</NUMEX> as a result of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cubaâ</ENAMEX>€™s state appropriations and seizing of assets. In retaliation, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> launched a trade embargo in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1960</TIMEX> against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX> that continues to this day. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1961</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>-trained <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cuban</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">exiles</ENAMEX> attempted an overthrow of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Castroâ€™s</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>, resulting in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bay</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Pigs</ENAMEX> fiasco.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> remained fundamentally opposed to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cubaâ</ENAMEX>€™s political evolution and sought to isolate <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Castro</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latin America</ENAMEX>. Soon after the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bay</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Pigs</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Castro</ENAMEX> declared himself a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marxist-Leninist</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Castro</ENAMEX> had not displayed any <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Communist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inclinations</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1950s</TIMEX>, and some suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aggression</ENAMEX> pushed him to ingratiate himself with the powerful <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> and its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eastern</ENAMEX> block of potential trading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partners</ENAMEX>. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the 1980s</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 80 percent</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cuban</ENAMEX> trade was with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USSR</ENAMEX>, which also provided <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX> with a subsidy of state support worth <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">an estimated US$5 billion</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annually</TIMEX>.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1962</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nikita Khrushchev</ENAMEX> installed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42</NUMEX> medium-range nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missiles</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John F. Kennedy</ENAMEX> imposed a naval blockade on the island to ensure no more <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missiles</ENAMEX> arrived and insisted that the existing ones be removed. After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six days</TIMEX> of eyeball-to-eyeball challenge (now known in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">â€œCuban Missile Crisisâ€</ENAMEX>), the potential nuclear disaster was averted when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Khrushchev</ENAMEX> backed down in return for a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> promise never to invade <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Special Period</ENAMEX>
Until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the 1980s</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> trade and subsidies were crucial factors in propping up <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Cubaâ€™s</ENAMEX> heavily centralized and often badly planned economy. But the subsequent dismantling of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> suddenly left <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX> bereft of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX>, and hard currency.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cuban</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> announced the start of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">peacetime â€œSpecial Periodâ€</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX>, introducing new austerity measures. Though <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rationing</ENAMEX> had existed since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1960s</TIMEX>, it was increased to cover many more basic items. It became virtually impossible for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cubans</ENAMEX> to live on rations alone. To make matters worse, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX> Democracy Act extended the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US</ENAMEX> embargo to cover a ban on trade with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX> for foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">subsidiaries</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>.
With its economy in disarray, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> introduced a limited number of capitalist measures while maintaining a firm political grip. Foreign investment, in the form of joint ventures in the fields of tourism and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mineral</ENAMEX> and oil exploration, was keenly encouraged.
The dangers of exposure to foreign opinion and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œmoral corruptionâ€</ENAMEX> from the rapidly expanding tourism industry is now viewed as a necessary evil. The adoption of measures such as the legalization of the dollar and small-scale private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enterprises</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>, and the introduction of private farmersâ€™ markets in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX>, have improved the welfare of some <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cubans</ENAMEX>. The situation for others, with no access to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">dollars</NUMEX>, has turned increasingly desperate.
No doubt many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cubans</ENAMEX> would emigrate if allowed to do so. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 1994</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Castro</ENAMEX> suddenly lifted restrictions on those wishing to leave (coastal patrols usually force potential Ã©migrÃ©s to return). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">More than 30,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cubans</ENAMEX> tried to cross <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">shark</ENAMEX>-infested <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> on improvised rafts. Facing a dramatic influx of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cubans</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> abolished the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> policy of automatic asylum to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cuban</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">refugees</ENAMEX>, placing them in a makeshift tent settlement in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">GuantÃ¡namo Bay Naval Base</ENAMEX>.
In the opinion of many, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX> is an isolated socialist <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dinosaur</ENAMEX>. Yet itÂ â€”Â and its aging <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">leaderÂ â€”Â soldier</ENAMEX> on against all odds. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US</ENAMEX> embargo, denounced by an ever-increasing majority in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Nations</ENAMEX>, is spurred on by vehement anti-Castro lobbying by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cubans</ENAMEX> in southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX>. Still, changes in the status quo seem likely. But <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nearly four decades</TIMEX> after the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cuban</ENAMEX> missile crisis, the world continues to wait, wondering whether a lifting of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> trade and tourism sanctions or a change in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX> will arrive <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>.
