A Brief HISTORY
I s it history or blarney to suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">St.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brendan</ENAMEX>, a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixth-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">monk</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Galway</ENAMEX>, was the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> to reach <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>? The good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newfoundland</ENAMEX>, where he is said to have landed, like to think he was. After all, on his return he told of being attacked by <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX> as big as <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">chickens</ENAMEX>. ‚ÄúOf course,<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">‚Äù</ENAMEX> say the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newfies, ‚Äúthey</ENAMEX> must have been our giant <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes!‚</ENAMEX>Äù
A more serious claim is made for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vikings</ENAMEX>, who seem to have sailed to the coast from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greenland</ENAMEX> around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year 1000</TIMEX>. That is the carbon dating of tools and utensils, the vestiges of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> and workshops, and even an iron <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">foundry</ENAMEX> dug up at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L‚</ENAMEX>ÄôAnse aux <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Meadows</ENAMEX> on the northern tip of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newfoundland</ENAMEX>.
This takes some of the wind out of the sails of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Cabot</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Venetian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">navigator</ENAMEX> who claimed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canada‚</ENAMEX>Äôs eastern seaboard for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">England‚Äôs Henry VII</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1497</TIMEX>. Locals fight over whether it was <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nova Scotia</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Newfoundland</ENAMEX> he actually discovered. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cabot</ENAMEX> himself mistook it for the northeast coast of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX>. In fact, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Breton, Basque</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fishermen</ENAMEX> had been here long before him but kept to themselves the secret of the coastal waters‚Äô teeming cod <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">fisheries</ENAMEX>. Initially, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> were attracted to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> only by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>, preferring to concentrate their colonizing activities farther down the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> coast.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> came looking for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diamonds</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spices</ENAMEX>, and a passage to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1535</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacques Cartier</ENAMEX> ventured up the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Lawrence</ENAMEX> as far as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hochelaga Village</ENAMEX>, dominated by a hill he named <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mont R√©al</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mount Royal</ENAMEX>). Cartier was not exactly showered with honors when he returned with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eleven</NUMEX> barrels of worthless yellow iron <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pyrites</ENAMEX> and glittering quartz. For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next 70 years</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> was all but ignored until the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> turned to the more lucrative new fur trade.
The strange <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> comings and goings were observed by native <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peoples</ENAMEX> whose ancestors had preceded these <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">‚Äúdiscoverers‚Äù</ENAMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 12,000</NUMEX>, some of them <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55,000</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>. Waves of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Siberian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hunters</ENAMEX> had crossed a land bridge over the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bering Strait</ENAMEX> in pursuit of mammoth and bison. They spread through <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alaska</ENAMEX>, south along the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific</ENAMEX> coast to the region of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">British Columbia</ENAMEX>, and later east across the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yukon</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Northwest Territories</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New France</ENAMEX>
With no written culture to document it, the pre-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> history of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Inuit</ENAMEX> and other early <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peoples</ENAMEX> is a vague archaeological patchwork of bones, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stones</ENAMEX>, and artifacts. Their brief encounters with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fishermen</ENAMEX> left little impact, but the advent of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> and later <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> colonizers brought, in exchange for their <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">beaver pelts</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">copper</ENAMEX> kettles and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX>, blankets and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">brandy</ENAMEX>, Christianity, measles, and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">smallpox</ENAMEX>.
After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winters</TIMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bay</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fundy</ENAMEX> had proved too harsh, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samuel de Champlain</ENAMEX> and his first batch of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">settlers</ENAMEX> left <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nova Scotia</ENAMEX> and moved over to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Lawrence River</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1608</TIMEX>. Within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten years</TIMEX>, both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tenant farmers</ENAMEX> (habitants) and fur <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> (coureurs de bois, literally <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wood-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">runners</ENAMEX>) were colonizing <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Qu√©bec¬†‚Äî¬†New France¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†at the point where the river narrows.
To guarantee each habitant equal access to the waterfront, the farmland was divided into long narrow strips reaching down to the riverbanks. Local conditions were exploited with traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> ingenuity. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Manure</ENAMEX>, for instance, was shipped downriver by heaping it on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice floes</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the spring</TIMEX> thaw. Tough coureurs de bois sought furs from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Huron</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ontario</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algonquin</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Qu√©bec</ENAMEX>, quickly learning language and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">customs</ENAMEX> and even marrying into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tribes</ENAMEX>.
Meanwhile, the huge untapped fur resources of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">northern Qu√©bec</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ontario</ENAMEX> attracted the renewed attention of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1610</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">navigator</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Hudson</ENAMEX> thought he had located the fabled <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Northwest Passage</ENAMEX> for his <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">backers</ENAMEX> when, rounding the northern tip of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qu√©bec</ENAMEX> and heading south, he hoped, to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>, he found himself locked in a vast bay on which he left his life and name. Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50 years later</TIMEX>, the bay was explored by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> enterprising <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frenchmen</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierre Esprit Radisson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M√©dard Chouart des Groseilliers</ENAMEX> (known to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglo</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">schoolchildren</ENAMEX> as ‚ÄúRadishes and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gooseberries‚Äù</ENAMEX>). Exasperated by the cost of the haul to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qu√©bec</ENAMEX> and by the heavy taxes imposed on fur pelts, they sought a new outlet for the fur trade. Fearing a commercial threat to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Lawrence River</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Qu√</ENAMEX>©bec opposed their survey of the region.
This decision proved to be <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the beginning of the end</TIMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New France</ENAMEX>, for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Radisson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Groseilliers</ENAMEX> promptly sold their idea to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">merchants</ENAMEX>, who in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1670</TIMEX> founded the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hudson‚Äôs Bay Company</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles II</ENAMEX> granted this tentacular private joint-stock <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> control of all territories draining into <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hudson Bay</ENAMEX>; they were named <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rupert‚Äôs Land</ENAMEX> after the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">king‚Äôs cousin</ENAMEX>, who was also titular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>. Its initials <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">H.B.C.</ENAMEX> came to mean ‚ÄúHere before <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christ</ENAMEX>.‚Äù It was here to stay.
The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> fur <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> were much less adventurous than the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>, waiting for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indians</ENAMEX> to bring their pelts to the trading post rather than seeking them out in the forest. The coureurs de bois were more adapted to the wilderness and understood the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indians</ENAMEX> better. From them they learned to make swift, light birchbark canoes, snowshoes, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pemmican¬†‚Äî¬†a ghastly</ENAMEX> but nourishing mixture of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">buffalo fat</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">bits</NUMEX> of dried <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meat</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">berries</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> also offered higher-quality goods. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">H.B.C.</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a penny</NUMEX>-pincher, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indians</ENAMEX> soon spotted¬<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">†‚Äî¬†and spat out¬†‚Äî¬†its</ENAMEX> raw <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> gin tinctured with iodine to imitate <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">brandy</ENAMEX>.
But <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> backed this vested interest with tough diplomacy and a powerful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">navy</ENAMEX>, while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Louis XIV</ENAMEX> was too wrapped up in his <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">power</ENAMEX> plays to pay much attention to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">French Canada</ENAMEX>. Although the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> made no military <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">conquests</ENAMEX> here during the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">War of Spanish Succession</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1700‚Äì1713</ENAMEX>), their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">negotiators</ENAMEX> forced the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> in the ensuing <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Treaty</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Utrecht</ENAMEX> to give up all of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acadia</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nova Scotia</ENAMEX>) except <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cape Breton</ENAMEX>. There, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> fortress of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Louisbourg</ENAMEX>, which defended the sea approaches to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qu√©bec</ENAMEX>, was seized by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1744</TIMEX>. It was returned <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four years later</TIMEX> in diplomatic negotiations, only to fall once and for all in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1758</TIMEX> in an assault mounted from the new <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> naval <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Halifax</ENAMEX>. In the final struggle for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qu√©bec</ENAMEX>, the courageous <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commander</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marquis de Montcalm</ENAMEX>, led outnumbered <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> to a victory at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ticonderoga</ENAMEX>. But, poorly coordinated with local <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">militia</ENAMEX>, they lost the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qu√</ENAMEX>©bec in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1759</TIMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Britain‚Äôs General</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Wolfe</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Plains</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abraham</ENAMEX>. Both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montcalm</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolfe</ENAMEX> were killed in the battle.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX> burned its flags and sailed home, followed by most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">merchants</ENAMEX> and colonial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX>, leaving the habitants to fend for themselves. After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">150 years</TIMEX> of courageous struggle against the harsh <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> wilderness, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New France</ENAMEX> was abandoned, the old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> displaying a cruel lack of enthusiasm for what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Voltaire</ENAMEX> dismissed as quelques arpens de neige¬†‚Äî¬†‚Äúa <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">few acres</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">snow</ENAMEX>.‚Äù 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> Take Over
At first, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX> did not exactly flock to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> either. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Governor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Murray</ENAMEX> sympathized with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Qu√©b√©cois</ENAMEX>, whose bravery he much admired. Although the established <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> was now <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglican</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catholic</ENAMEX> privileges and tithes were restored. These were enshrined in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Qu√©bec Act of 1774</ENAMEX>, which also maintained <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> civil law alongside <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> criminal law and gave <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French Catholics</ENAMEX> seats on an appointed governmental <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">council</ENAMEX>. But when <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">revolutionaries</ENAMEX> invaded <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Qu√</ENAMEX>©bec in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1775</TIMEX> in the hope of winning the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadians</ENAMEX> over to their cause, the latter did not rally to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> side until the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX> started taking the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">habitants‚Äô livestock</ENAMEX> and supplies.
When <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Independence</ENAMEX> was declared, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 40,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Loyalists¬†‚Äî¬†New Englanders</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Germans</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX>, but also some <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indians</ENAMEX> and black <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">slaves¬†‚Äî¬†moved</ENAMEX> north to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>. The most resilient settled on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prince</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward Island</ENAMEX> and in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nova Scotia</ENAMEX>, around the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bay</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fundy</ENAMEX>, while a majority migrated to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Niagara</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eastern Townships</ENAMEX> in southern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Qu√©bec</ENAMEX>.
To cope with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">rival</ENAMEX> claims of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Loyalists</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Qu√©b√©cois</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Constitutional Act of 1791</ENAMEX> divided the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX> into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Upper Canada</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ontario</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lower Canada</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qu√©bec</ENAMEX>), separated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottawa River</ENAMEX>. Under lieutenant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governors</ENAMEX>, each <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX> had a parliamentary system modeled on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Houses of Commons</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lords</ENAMEX>, while <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lower Canada‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">French</ENAMEX> language and civil and religious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX> were safeguarded.
The land west of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ontario</ENAMEX> was written off <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as one</NUMEX> big empty wilderness until <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alexander Mackenzie</ENAMEX> completed the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">transcontinental</ENAMEX> crossing, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simon Fraser</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Thompson</ENAMEX> mapped out the rivers and mountains of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">British Columbia</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rockies</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hudson‚Äôs Bay Company</ENAMEX> fought for control of the fur trade with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North West Company</ENAMEX>, which formed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1783</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nor‚</ENAMEX>Äôwesters commandeered the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> system of forts, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">depots</ENAMEX>, and canoe <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">brigades</ENAMEX>; they inter-married with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">native</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peoples</ENAMEX> and produced new clans of so-called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M√©tis.</ENAMEX> After years of fierce armed struggle for trading posts around <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hudson Bay</ENAMEX> and lakes <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Winnipeg</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Superior</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nor‚Äôwesters</ENAMEX> threw in their lot with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">H.B.C.</ENAMEX>, bringing a wilder, more imaginative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spirit</ENAMEX> to the staid old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>.
With great pioneering skill, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Upper Canada‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lieutenant governor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Simcoe</ENAMEX>, pushed new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">highways</ENAMEX> north from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lake Ontario</ENAMEX> and west to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hamilton</ENAMEX>. He established the provincial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> at a trading post, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toronto</ENAMEX>, in the heart of a malarial swamp, and renamed it York. A landed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gentry</ENAMEX> made up of army <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX>, government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>, and commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speculators</ENAMEX> ran the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX>, creating a hereditary aristocracy known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Family Compact</ENAMEX>. More <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> were lured over the border with land grants; the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> rose <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">from 14,000</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1792</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">90,000</NUMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1812</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadians</ENAMEX> were also multiplying rapidly, from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60,000</NUMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New France</ENAMEX> was abandoned in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1760</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">330,000</NUMEX> fifty <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years later</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> bore the brunt of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> hostility in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">War of 1812</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> were convinced that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> were backing <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> raids on <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">settlements</ENAMEX> along the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> border. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> called for nothing less than the conquest of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Major-General</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isaac Brock‚</ENAMEX>Äôs tiny <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX>, allied with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chief Tecumseh‚Äôs Shawnee Indians</ENAMEX>, routed a half-hearted <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> invasion along the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Niagara</ENAMEX> frontier. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> burned and looted York, provoking a violent <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> reprisal raid on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>.
Though greatly outnumbered, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglo</ENAMEX>- and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadians</ENAMEX> fought victoriously side by side at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ch√¢teauguay.</ENAMEX> But after the war, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">militia</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis-Joseph Papineau‚</ENAMEX>Äôs patriotes became the backbone of growing <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-British</ENAMEX> agitation. With <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> immigration on the increase, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qu√</ENAMEX>©b√©cois autonomy was threatened by moves towards one <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lower</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Upper Canada</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Landowners</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Papineau</ENAMEX> feared being swamped by projected improvements of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Lawrence</ENAMEX> trade route. In the general <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">paranoia</ENAMEX>, the patriotes even accused the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> of fostering <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Qu√©bec‚Äôs 1832</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cholera</ENAMEX> epidemic. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Papineau</ENAMEX> asked <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> for guarantees of autonomy for a Lower <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> assembly dominated by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadians</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> rejection in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1837</TIMEX> led to riots opposing patriotes and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">militia</ENAMEX>. After a victory at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">St.-Denis</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadians</ENAMEX> were crushed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Governor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Colborne‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> north of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montr√©al.</ENAMEX> Habitants‚Äô farmhouses were burned down, earning Colborne the nickname of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Old Firebrand</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vieux Br√ªlot</ENAMEX>), and defeat left an even more enduring bitterness than the original <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> conquest. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Papineau</ENAMEX> fled to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the same year</TIMEX>, hatred of the high-handed <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Tory</ENAMEX> oligarchy in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Upper Canada</ENAMEX> provoked a rebellion among small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX> and tradesmen beset by economic depression. Their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">champion</ENAMEX>, newspaper <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mayor</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toronto</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">William Lyon Mackenzie</ENAMEX>, proposed a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX>-style <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">republic</ENAMEX>. Heeding his call of ‚ÄúUp them, brave <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadians</ENAMEX>, get ready your <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">rifles</ENAMEX> and make short work of it,‚Äù <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a few hundred</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">irregulars</ENAMEX> gathered at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Montgomery‚Äôs Tavern</ENAMEX> north of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toronto</ENAMEX>. But a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Tory</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">militia</ENAMEX> led by bagpipes put down the so-called <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mackenzie Rebellion</ENAMEX> in a skirmish lasting <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">just a few minutes</TIMEX>. Short work indeed.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Governor General</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúRadical Jack‚Äù Durham</ENAMEX> was sent to put the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> in order; he proposed a unified assembly governing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canada‚</ENAMEX>Äôs domestic affairs. He scorned the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Qu√©b√©cois</ENAMEX> for ‚Äúretaining their peculiar language and manners. They are a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with no history and no literature.‚Äù But <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lower Canada‚</ENAMEX>Äôs pragmatic <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine</ENAMEX> accepted the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> framework as a means of asserting the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Qu√©b√©cois‚Äô</ENAMEX> right to equal representation. In the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Provinces of Canada</ENAMEX> set up in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1841</TIMEX>, he formed a delicate alliance with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toronto</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reformer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Baldwin</ENAMEX>. Immigration increased to meet an ambitious public works program of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canals</ENAMEX> to bypass the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Lawrence rapids</ENAMEX> and cross the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Niagara</ENAMEX> peninsula, as well as of new <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mines</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX>.
But the big news was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">railways</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1836</TIMEX>, was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Champlain</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Lawrence Railroad</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a few miles</NUMEX> of track between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montr√©al</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lake Champlain</ENAMEX>. By <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1854 more than 250 miles</NUMEX> joined <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Niagara</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Windsor</ENAMEX>. The dream of a transcontinental <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">railway</ENAMEX> with freight revenues drew <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">financiers</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Grand Trunk</ENAMEX> project to join up Montr√©al, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Great Lakes</ENAMEX>, and the western <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hinterland</ENAMEX>. But initially they had to content themselves with luring <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> trade to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Lawrence</ENAMEX> by linking eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portland</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maine</ENAMEX>.
Choosing a permanent capital for these <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United Provinces</ENAMEX> wasn‚Äôt easy. In the perennial <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Anglo-French</ENAMEX> conflict, bilingual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montr√©al</ENAMEX> was too troublesome, while English-speaking <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toronto</ENAMEX> or French-speaking <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Qu√©bec City</ENAMEX> would favor one <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> at the expense of the other. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Engineer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> sent watercolors of likely sites for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Queen Victoria‚</ENAMEX>Äôs approval. The choice went to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bytown</ENAMEX>, a puny lumber <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">depot</ENAMEX> renamed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottawa</ENAMEX> after the river on which it stood, diplomatically situated between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Upper</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lower Canada</ENAMEX>.
To the east, and remote from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> of power, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newfoundland</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maritime Provinces</ENAMEX> lived in small, isolated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> with no unifying geography comparable to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Great Lakes</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Lawrence River</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newfoundland</ENAMEX> turned its back on the hostile interior to reap the harvests of the sea. Always psychologically closer to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> than to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottawa</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Newfoundland</ENAMEX> did not become part of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1949</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yankee Loyalists</ENAMEX> struggled valiantly with a region they called <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Nova Scarcity</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> had scattered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nova Scotia‚Äôs French Acadians</ENAMEX>, some to the nearby islands of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">St.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierre</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miquelon</ENAMEX> (still <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>), others as far as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Louisiana</ENAMEX>, while a small nucleus remained in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Brunswick</ENAMEX>. The potential of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prince</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward Island‚</ENAMEX>Äôs fertile soil was squandered by absentee land <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speculators</ENAMEX> who milked it only for the rent and left the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">settlers</ENAMEX> no motivation to develop it.
Even farther away, the west was still administered as a separate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">H.B.C.</ENAMEX> until gold discovered on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Queen Charlotte Island</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1852</TIMEX> and on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fraser River</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six years later</TIMEX> prompted <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> to set up a new <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX> to control the influx of unruly <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> fortune-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hunters</ENAMEX>. The company‚Äôs chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Douglas</ENAMEX>, became first <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">British Columbia</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> kept upper <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX> from migrating to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Prairies</ENAMEX> by depicting a sub-<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Arctic</ENAMEX> wasteland, but <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">surveyors</ENAMEX> found the valleys of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saskatchewan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Assiniboine</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Red rivers</ENAMEX> to be fertile and ideal for agriculture. The western <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trek</ENAMEX> began. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> was taking shape.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Confederation</ENAMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British North America</ENAMEX> Act of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1867</TIMEX> created the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dominion of Canada</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John A. Macdonald</ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ontario</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Tory</ENAMEX>, was the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prime Minister</ENAMEX>. To resist a turbulent <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> torn by civil war, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglo</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadians</ENAMEX> wanted a strong central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> delegating little more than municipal affairs to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">provinces</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadians</ENAMEX> insisted on a federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> with stronger provincial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX>, to protect specific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qu√</ENAMEX>©b√©cois interests in property and civil rights. Henceforth, national unity always played <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> fiddle to ethnic, religious, and above all economic regional interests.
Only the promise of a transcontinental <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">railway</ENAMEX> brought <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nova Scotia</ENAMEX> immediately into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Confederation</ENAMEX>, with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">British Columbia</ENAMEX> joining in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1871</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prince</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward Island</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1873</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rupert‚Äôs Land</ENAMEX> was bought from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">H.B.C.</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1869</TIMEX>, but incorporating <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manitoba</ENAMEX> was not so easy. Led by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis Riel</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M√</ENAMEX>©tis <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">descendants</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indians</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> fur <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> waged an armed struggle for land rights on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Red River</ENAMEX> in the face of the expansion-hungry railway <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">builders</ENAMEX>. An impassioned <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politician</ENAMEX> as well as a fiery military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Riel</ENAMEX> won local <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Anglo-Saxon</ENAMEX> support for his proposed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manitoba</ENAMEX> Act guaranteeing equal <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> language rights in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>. But the execution of a troublemaker from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toronto</ENAMEX> brought in a retaliatory force of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ontario</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">troops</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Riel</ENAMEX> fled to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M√</ENAMEX>©tis were driven off their fertile land and back to hunting on the plains.
The railway literally created new <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Winnipeg</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vancouver</ENAMEX>, which was the western <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terminus</ENAMEX>. Against all the experts‚Äô advice, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canadian Pacific Railway Company‚Äôs</ENAMEX> general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Cornelius Van Horne</ENAMEX>, built tracks around <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lake</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Superior</ENAMEX> and west across the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prairies</ENAMEX> to meet <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrew Onderdonk‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">laborers</ENAMEX> working their way east through <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Kicking Horse Pass</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rockies</ENAMEX>. The transcontinental dream became reality when the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tracks</ENAMEX> were joined in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1885</TIMEX>. But along the way, scores of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">laborers</ENAMEX> had died hacking through the mountains, buffalo were exterminated, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indians</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M√</ENAMEX>©tis were dispossessed of their lands.
These were booming times. Less spectacular than the completion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C.P.R.</ENAMEX> but economically vital, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> hydroelectric <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">installation</ENAMEX> began functioning on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Niagara Falls</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1895</TIMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A year later</TIMEX>, gold was struck in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Klondike</ENAMEX>, opening up the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yukon</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100,000</NUMEX> panhandlers and camp <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">followers</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Prairie Provinces</ENAMEX> profited from soaring worldwide <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wheat</ENAMEX> exports.
Presiding over this new prosperity was the country‚Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prime Minister</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilfrid Laurier</ENAMEX>, an elegant, eloquent <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Liberal</ENAMEX>. Completely bilingual, he was determined to forge <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglo</ENAMEX>- and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadians</ENAMEX> into one <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>, comparing them to the waters of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottawa</ENAMEX> river and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Great Lakes</ENAMEX> meeting below the island of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Montr√©al: ‚Äúparallel</ENAMEX>, separate, distinguishable, and yet one stream, flowing within the same <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äù Visiting London for Queen Victoria‚Äôs Diamond Jubilee</ENAMEX>, he charmed his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hosts</ENAMEX> by declaring: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>ÄúI am <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> to the core.‚Äù He was knighted on the spot.
But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laurier</ENAMEX> saw the limits of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> support when the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">negotiators</ENAMEX> of the Alaska boundary tamely accepted the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> claims to a southern coastal ‚Äúpanhandle,‚Äù which denied Canada sea access to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yukon</ENAMEX> goldfields. He asserted greater national autonomy by taking over <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> military installations and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shipyards</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Esquimalt</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vancouver Island</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Halifax</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nova Scotia</ENAMEX>. When <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alberta</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saskatchewan</ENAMEX> acceded to provincial status in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1905</TIMEX>, and the country‚Äôs mining, lumber, paper, and pulp industries burgeoned, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Laurier</ENAMEX> championed a new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">transcontinental railway</ENAMEX> that would take a more northerly route to serve <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">them¬†‚Äî¬†the</ENAMEX> state-owned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canadian National Railway</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C.N.R.</ENAMEX>).
Laurier‚Äôs conciliatory efforts did not diminish <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Anglo-French Canadian</ENAMEX> differences. Conflicts raged over the denial of equal rights to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catholic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manitoba</ENAMEX>, and a <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Prohibition</ENAMEX> referendum (blocked only by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX>-drinking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Qu√©b√©cois</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qu√</ENAMEX>©b√©cois were slow to jump on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">wagon</ENAMEX> of industrial progress. Political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henri Bourassa</ENAMEX> and influential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jules-Paul Tardivel</ENAMEX> insisted on time-honored rural traditions. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚ÄúOur</ENAMEX> mission is to possess the soil,‚Äù they said, not to pursue ‚ÄúAmerican‚Äù obsessions with industry and money. They resented the sending of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Africa</ENAMEX> to support the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Boer War</ENAMEX>, and were no more enthusiastic about the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Anglo-French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">alliance</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">I. Bourassa</ENAMEX> said ‚ÄúThe real <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enemies</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadians</ENAMEX> are not the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Germans</ENAMEX> but <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">anglicizers</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ontario</ENAMEX> intriguers or <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Irish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priests</ENAMEX>.‚Äù
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Twentieth Century</ENAMEX>
Under <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Tory</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> supported <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War I</ENAMEX>, losing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 60,000</NUMEX> on the battlefield. Emotional <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> nationalism spread to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Citizens</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Austrian</ENAMEX> origin were dismissed from public service, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> language was banned in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ontario</ENAMEX>, was renamed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kitchener</ENAMEX>.
But the war was good for the economy, supporting <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX> manufacture, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">railways</ENAMEX>, and especially agriculture‚Äôs huge <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wheat</ENAMEX> exports. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trade</ENAMEX> union <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">membership</ENAMEX> expanded from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">166,000</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1914</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">378,000</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1919</TIMEX>, being emphatically more radical in the west, where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> chose to assert their new organizational strength by calling for a proletarian revolution. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vancouver</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Calgary</ENAMEX>, they cheered the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bolshevik</ENAMEX> victory in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> blamed the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1919</TIMEX> general strike in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Winnipeg</ENAMEX> on ‚Äúenemy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aliens</ENAMEX>,‚Äù but the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> were in fact <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX>. In classic <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> style, the campaign for a united national <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">union</ENAMEX> movement fell victim to narrow regional interests: those of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ontario‚</ENAMEX>Äôs tiny <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Communist Party</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catholic Union</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qu√©bec.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Lyon Mackenzie King</ENAMEX>, who became <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Liberal Party</ENAMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Laurier‚</ENAMEX>Äôs death, made <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> progressively more independent of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>. At the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Imperial Conference</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1926</TIMEX> he won the acknowledgement that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> was autonomous in external affairs and thus not subject to a common, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX>-dominated policy for the whole <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Empire</ENAMEX>. This led to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1931 Statute</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Westminster</ENAMEX>, which effected the equality of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dominions</ENAMEX>, thus consecrating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canada‚</ENAMEX>Äôs full autonomy in home and foreign affairs. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor general</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottawa</ENAMEX> became the symbolic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crown</ENAMEX> rather than of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>. But the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">provinces</ENAMEX> insisted that the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Constitution</ENAMEX> remain with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> rather than let <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottawa</ENAMEX> infringe on their prerogatives.
At the same time, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> came more and more into the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> economic and cultural orbit. The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">boom years of the 1920s</TIMEX> saw the growth of a ‚Äúbranch-plant economy;‚Äù with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">automobile</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rubber</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemical</ENAMEX>, and clothing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factories</ENAMEX> springing up around the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Great Lakes</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hamilton</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oshawa</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Windsor</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montr√©al.</ENAMEX> The boom in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> popular culture inundated <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> with radio, movies, and mass-market <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazines</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Qu√©bec</ENAMEX>, in particular, tried to resist the invasion, even going so far as to ban <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adolescents</ENAMEX> from cinemas. Apart from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group of Seven</ENAMEX>, a spirited <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">band</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ontario</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painters</ENAMEX> who were seeking a distinctive ‚Äúnational‚Äù style, most <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX>-born <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">artists¬†‚Äî¬†actors</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">musicians</ENAMEX>, and writers¬†‚Äî¬†felt obliged to seek fame and fortune in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX>.
Canada‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Great Depression</ENAMEX> was felt first by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Prairie Provinces</ENAMEX>, unable to get rid of their surplus from the wheat glut of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1928</TIMEX>. Even the drought in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1929</TIMEX> did not ease matters, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten more years</TIMEX> of bad harvests meant they would not recoup their losses. Other sectors of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">economy¬†‚Äî¬†timber</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">fisheries</ENAMEX>, mining, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">construction¬†‚Äî¬†ground</ENAMEX> to a halt as production outstripped demand. Spirits were raised by the escapist fare of the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission</ENAMEX>, today‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C.B.C.¬†‚Äî¬†Hollywood</ENAMEX> extravaganzas, and home-grown media stunts, not the least of which was the hullabaloo surrounding the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dionne</ENAMEX> quintuplets, born in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ontario</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1934</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trans-Canada Airlines</ENAMEX>, the forerunner of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Canada</ENAMEX>, started up in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1937</TIMEX>, and air travel became vital for covering the vast distances, fighting forest fires, and carrying provisions and wages to remote corners of the far north. Natural enough, then, that involvement in <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX> began with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Commonwealth Air Training Plan</ENAMEX>, using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canada‚</ENAMEX>Äôs safer skies to prepare <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> for combat. At the outbreak of war, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canada‚</ENAMEX>Äôs reputation for welcoming <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">refugees</ENAMEX> from all over the world was tarnished by the blocking of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Communists</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hitler‚Äôs Germany</ENAMEX>. Asked how many he would allow in, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ernest Lapointe said: ‚ÄúNone</ENAMEX> is too many.‚Äù After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1941</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> origin were interned and had their property confiscated.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1940</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mackenzie King</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Franklin D. Roosevelt</ENAMEX> signed a joint <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> defense pact, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year later</TIMEX> integrated their countries‚Äô economies for the duration of the war. War was again good for business. Out of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11,500,000</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than a million</NUMEX> were directly working in war-allied industries, most of them in brand-new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factories</ENAMEX>. Over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">730,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> served in the armed forces, which suffered <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43,000</NUMEX> losses. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1942</TIMEX>, without adequate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Allied</ENAMEX> naval and air support, the high-risk amphibious raid of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dieppe</ENAMEX> proved disastrous (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost 1,000</NUMEX> killed, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,000</NUMEX> captured). With more careful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Allied</ENAMEX> planning <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year later</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadians</ENAMEX> played a distinguished role in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sicily</ENAMEX> landings and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX> campaign, as well as the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D-Day</ENAMEX> invasion of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Normandy</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1944</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social</ENAMEX> policies made important advances during and immediately after the war. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1944</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saskatchewan</ENAMEX> elected the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> socialist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North America¬†‚Äî¬†the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C.C.F.</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Liberal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> responded by appropriating much of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C.C.F.‚</ENAMEX>Äôs reform program. But <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">native</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peoples</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Inuit</ENAMEX> did not win the right to vote in federal elections until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1960</TIMEX>.
Economically, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> was closer than ever to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. The consumer boom accentuated dependency on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America‚Äôs Canada</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch-plant manufacturers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX>, radios, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TVs</ENAMEX>, and refrigerators. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> was also Canada‚Äôs main <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">customer</ENAMEX> for raw materials and energy in what was a veritable explosion of industrial achievement. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Manitoba</ENAMEX> nickel and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Labrador</ENAMEX> iron were replacing depleted resources south of the border; huge oil strikes were made near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Edmonton</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alberta</ENAMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1947</TIMEX>; a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">uranium</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">reactor</ENAMEX> started up in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ontario</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1952</TIMEX>; and hydro-electric <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> mushroomed all across the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Lawrence Seaway</ENAMEX> was opened in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1959</TIMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Six years later</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drivers</ENAMEX> could cross the entire continent on the Trans-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canada Highway</ENAMEX>.
The national culture fared less well. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Commission on the Arts and Letters</ENAMEX> was spurned by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prime Minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis St. Laurent</ENAMEX> as a futile <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúsubsidizing ballet dancers</ENAMEX>.‚Äù While there was more cultural aid promised than ever delivered, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> positive result was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">foundation</ENAMEX> of the highly creative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Film Board</ENAMEX>.
Balancing domestic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">interests</ENAMEX> and relations with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX> became increasingly delicate. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prime Minister</ENAMEX> from one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Prairie Provinces</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saskatchewan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Tory</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Diefenbaker</ENAMEX>, made himself popular with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX> by negotiating a sale of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wheat</ENAMEX> surplus to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> that tripled their <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">incomes¬†‚Äî¬†but unpopular</ENAMEX> with his <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX> for doing business with the ‚ÄúCommunist devil.‚Äù In the wake of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1962</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cuban</ENAMEX> missile crisis with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Soviet Union</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> wanted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diefenbaker</ENAMEX> to accept nuclear warheads on <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> soil. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Kennedy</ENAMEX> attacked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diefenbaker‚</ENAMEX>Äôs hesitation and prevarication, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prime Minister</ENAMEX> was defeated at the next election, after the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Liberals</ENAMEX> had jumped on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> bandwagon.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> celebrated its centenary in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1967</TIMEX> with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World‚Äôs Fair</ENAMEX>, the Montreal <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Expo</ENAMEX>. It was an opportunity to assert a more creative side of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qu√</ENAMEX>©bec‚Äôs identity amid the province‚Äôs growing militancy. Parallel to the worldwide independence movements in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qu√</ENAMEX>©b√©cois <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">separatists</ENAMEX> fought elections demanding to be <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúma√Ætres chez nous‚Äù (‚Äúmasters</ENAMEX> in our own <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home ‚Äù</ENAMEX>). In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1967</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">De Gaulle</ENAMEX> declaimed his famous <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚ÄúVive le Qu√©bec libre!‚Äù (‚ÄúLong</ENAMEX> live free <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Qu√©bec!‚Äù</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montr√©al City Hall</ENAMEX>, forgetting for a moment that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> had sided with his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vichy</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enemies</ENAMEX> during <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War</ENAMEX> II.
As a progressive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minister</ENAMEX> of justice, who reformed laws against homosexuality, divorce, birth control, and abortion, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierre Elliott Trudeau</ENAMEX> was sympathetic to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>-Canadians‚Äô demand to have their language placed on an equal national footing with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX>. But this sophisticated, bilingual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montr√</ENAMEX>©al <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> opposed what he regarded as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Qu√©bec‚Äôs</ENAMEX> tribalistic urge to exclude all things <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> from its own <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elegant</ENAMEX>, witty, and cosmopolitan, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trudeau</ENAMEX> became <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Liberal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prime Minister</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1968¬†‚</NUMEX>Äî¬†and like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wilfrid Laurier</ENAMEX> before him, just the kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglo</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadians</ENAMEX> love. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qu√</ENAMEX>©b√©cois were less enthusiastic. With the introduction of the birth-control <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pill</ENAMEX>, the province‚Äôs birthrate dropped from the highest to lowest in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>, causing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conservatives</ENAMEX> to worry at the waning influence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catholic Church</ENAMEX> and the prospect that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadians</ENAMEX> would drown in a sea of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglos</ENAMEX>. When <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Ren√© L√©vesque‚Äôs separatist Parti Qu√©b√©cois</ENAMEX> was defeated in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1970</TIMEX> provincial elections by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Bourassa‚Äôs Liberals</ENAMEX>, embittered militants of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Front de Lib√©ration du Qu√©bec</ENAMEX> (FLQ) turned to terrorism. In quick succession, they kidnapped <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trade</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Commissioner</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Cross</ENAMEX> and murdered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bourassa‚Äôs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Minister</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Labor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierre Laporte</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> approved <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trudeau‚</ENAMEX>Äôs tough reaction; invoking the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">War Measures Act</ENAMEX>, he sent in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> and arrested <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">468 militants.</TIMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FLQ</ENAMEX> was outlawed. Despite <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L√©vesque‚Äôs</ENAMEX> victory in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1976</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qu√</ENAMEX>©bec gradually moved away from outright separatism to a militant but more limited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">program</ENAMEX>, which preserved the province‚Äôs specific culture by imposing the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">French</ENAMEX> language in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>, industry, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Radicals</ENAMEX> were delighted by the subsequent westward exodus of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qu√©bec‚Äôs Anglo</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadians</ENAMEX>, but in the process <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toronto</ENAMEX> was to bypass <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montr√</ENAMEX>©al in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, financial, and even cultural activity.
After a brief respite in private life, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trudeau</ENAMEX> returned for what he felt was his crowning achievement, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Constitution Act of 1982</ENAMEX>, the consummation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canada‚</ENAMEX>Äôs political identity. The act transferred <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canada‚Äôs</ENAMEX> constitution to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottawa</ENAMEX> by removing the old obligation to refer amendments to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX>, and incorporated a new <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Charter of Rights</ENAMEX> and Freedoms similar to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Declaration of the Rights of Man</ENAMEX>.
Despite a referendum vote by its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> against separatism <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years earlier</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qu√©bec</ENAMEX> was defiantly the only <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX> not to sign the new constitution, feeling its cultural specificity had not been guaranteed. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Tory</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prime Minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brian Mulroney</ENAMEX> won the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qu√©b√©cois</ENAMEX> over in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</TIMEX> with an accord recognizing them as a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">‚Äúdistinct</ENAMEX> society.‚Äù He appeased the other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">provinces</ENAMEX> by conceding important new powers in shared-cost programs, immigration, and appointments to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1990s</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qu√©bec</ENAMEX> has remained a part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">federation</ENAMEX> by only the slimmest electoral margins. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Inuit</ENAMEX> and other indigenous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peoples</ENAMEX> have also negotiated concessions for their lands and resources, and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>, the immense <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Northern Territories</ENAMEX> divided in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>. The eastern <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>, which takes in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baffin Island</ENAMEX>, the land around <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hudson‚Äôs Bay</ENAMEX>, and most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Arctic</ENAMEX> islands, is now called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Nunavut</ENAMEX> and essentially functions as an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Inuit</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">homeland</ENAMEX>. The remaining <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Northwest Territories</ENAMEX> officially retain the territory‚Äôs old name, though many refer to the region as the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Western Arctic</ENAMEX>. The success of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nunavut</ENAMEX> has led other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">native groups</ENAMEX> to settle claims with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>. 
Canada‚Äôs national unity remains a dynamic ‚Äúwork in progress.‚Äù 
THE <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EARLIEST PEOPLES</ENAMEX>
Apart from a few explorers, trappers, gold-diggers, and oil <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drillers</ENAMEX>, most <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadians</ENAMEX> have preferred to hug the narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">strip</ENAMEX> along the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> border and know little of the northern wilderness. The only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who have embraced all of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canada‚Äôs</ENAMEX> vast <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">territory</ENAMEX> are the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Inuit</ENAMEX> and other pre-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Columbian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peoples</ENAMEX>, even though they now number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than half a million</NUMEX> and have never been many more. Canada‚Äôs distinctness is better appreciated by a closer look at some of its earliest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peoples</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pioneers</ENAMEX>
In the beginning, as far as human beings were concerned, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> was a void. Siberian <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hunters</ENAMEX> crossed the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bering Strait</ENAMEX> in several waves. While the earliest, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">around 70,000 b.c.</NUMEX>, moved down the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific</ENAMEX> coast to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South America</ENAMEX>, the settlement of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> began <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">some 15,000 years after</TIMEX>, spreading across the continent from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yukon</ENAMEX> and, much later, from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">British Columbia</ENAMEX>. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8000</TIMEX> b.c., <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indians</ENAMEX> were hunting <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">caribou</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nova Scotia</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Archaeologists</ENAMEX> believe that the pattern of life in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stone Age</ENAMEX> was not so very different from what the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Europeans</ENAMEX> encountered.
In the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Arctic</ENAMEX> region, the stabilization of the sea level and a dramatic cooling of the climate around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1500</TIMEX> b.c. caused <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hunters</ENAMEX> to switch from land mammals to fish, seal, walrus, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">whale</ENAMEX>, and ice-dwelling polar bear. At the same time, these ancestors of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Inuit</ENAMEX> moved out of their skin <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tents</ENAMEX> into warmer igloos of hardened <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">snow</ENAMEX> blocks. They glided over the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> on skates of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ivory</ENAMEX> or antler horn. From the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yukon</ENAMEX>, further migrations took them north to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">High Arctic</ENAMEX>, south around <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hudson Bay</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manitoba</ENAMEX>, east to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greenland</ENAMEX>, and down the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Labrador</ENAMEX> coast to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newfoundland</ENAMEX>.
For the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Coast</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peoples</ENAMEX>, as the song says, the living was easy. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> were indeed jumping; <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bountiful salmon</ENAMEX> were barbecued in the summertime, smoked for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the winter</TIMEX>. Prehistoric techniques for fishing and trapping have continued right into modern times, though bone has been replaced by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steel</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Columbia‚</ENAMEX>Äôs favorite freshwater fishing sites, at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hell‚Äôs Gate</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fraser Canyon</ENAMEX>, has been going strong for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9,000 years</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prairie Indians</ENAMEX> hunted buffalo by forcing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">herds</ENAMEX> onto marshland, snowbanks, thin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX>, or over <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cliffs¬†‚Äî¬†one</ENAMEX> of these nasty surprises being known to this day as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Head-Smashed</ENAMEX>-In buffalo jump, near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fort MacLeod</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alberta</ENAMEX>. Already in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3000</TIMEX> b.c. these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> were drying and smoking strips of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meat¬†‚Äî¬†modern beef</ENAMEX> jerky. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ontario</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qu√©bec</ENAMEX>, where encroaching forests gradually dispersed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">herds</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">caribou</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iroquois</ENAMEX> ousted the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algonquin</ENAMEX> and settled down to cultivate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">maize</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beans</ENAMEX>, and squash, living in rectangular, multifamily <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">longhouses</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Inuit</ENAMEX>
These toughest of all <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadians</ENAMEX> have withstood the hardships of the far north, including its icy deserts and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Arctic</ENAMEX> blizzards, but were nearly wiped out by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">diseases¬†‚Äî¬†measles</ENAMEX>, mumps, and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">smallpox</ENAMEX>. Estimated at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">81,000</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 18th century</TIMEX>, they now number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 27,000</NUMEX>, living mostly in the eastern <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Northwest Territories</ENAMEX>. They succeeded in having the eastern section of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Northwest Territories</ENAMEX> officially renamed <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Nunavut¬†‚Äî¬†‚ÄúOur Land‚Äù¬†‚Äî¬†and</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nunavut</ENAMEX> became the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">11th</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>. 
Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1950s</TIMEX> the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> has gathered most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Inuit</ENAMEX> together in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village communities</ENAMEX>, to improve their education, medical care, and general welfare. But more scattered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">High Arctic</ENAMEX> still prefer to live in traditional igloos, better insulated than in stone <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>, and with an infinite supply of building materials.
The characteristic snow-block <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dome</ENAMEX> measures <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4 to 5 m</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 to 15</NUMEX> ft) in diameter at the base. An entrance <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tunnel</ENAMEX> with a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen</ENAMEX> alcove on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> side, and storage alcoves on the other, leads to the main living area. Light is provided by <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">whale</ENAMEX>-blubber oil lamps, as well as by the translucent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">snow</ENAMEX> walls or a clear<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">-ice skylight</ENAMEX>. The igloos are often connected by a whole <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tunnels</ENAMEX>. This proved particularly convenient for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Caribou Inuit</ENAMEX> practice of co-marriage: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couples</ENAMEX> would exchange sexual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partners</ENAMEX>, not in a casual way, but as a real alternate marriage, strengthening ties between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">interlocking families</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social</ENAMEX> solidarity in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Arctic</ENAMEX> cold, is of course, important. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hudson Bay</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> became mumiqatigiik or dancing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partners</ENAMEX>, a friendship solemnized ritualistically when <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buddies</ENAMEX> hit each other very hard on the face and shoulders, exchanged gifts, and danced together until exhausted. And why do <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Inuit</ENAMEX> kiss by rubbing noses rather than with their lips? That way they won‚Äôt stick to one another in below-freezing temperatures.
The Kwakiutl
For the relative opulence of their way of life, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kwakiutl of British Columbia‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific</ENAMEX> coast on and around <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vancouver Island</ENAMEX> count among the aristocrats of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian native</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peoples</ENAMEX>. For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX>, they have harvested an abundance of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> from the ocean and rivers¬†‚Äî¬†not just salmon but halibut, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">herring</ENAMEX>, mussels, and clams. From the forests they have hewed red cedar planks for handsomely crafted <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">22-m</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">65</NUMEX>-ft) canoes to negotiate the coastal waters. Before <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> textiles arrived on the scene, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">Kwakiutl pounded cedar</ENAMEX> bark until it was supple and soft enough to weave into capes, skirts, and blankets.
The mild climate and generally easy living have given them the leisure to develop artistic talents less apparent among <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">native</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peoples</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Inuit</ENAMEX> facing harsher conditions. Elaborate decoration has gone into fashioning the simplest everyday <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">objects¬†‚Äî¬†clothing</ENAMEX>, baskets, storage boxes, even fishhooks. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carpentry</ENAMEX> is the most valued of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kwakiutl</ENAMEX> skills, and is spectacularly displayed in their totem poles. But this is not an ancient art form. The huge freestanding red cedar poles erected in front of their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> are essentially a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19th-century</TIMEX> phenomenon, dependent, for their intricate design, on the chisels, steel axes, curved knives, and other metal tools bartered from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Europeans</ENAMEX> for the skins of sea otters. Size was originally limited to that of the poles and beams used to build the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>, to which the carvings were directly attached. Then, as personal wealth diminished with a slump in the fur trade, totem poles became prime symbols of a chief‚Äôs prestige, soaring to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</NUMEX> ft) and more. While they survive now only in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX>, especially in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vancouver</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">155</NUMEX>) the ritual gift giving known as potlatch has re-emerged after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> of official prohibition. Derived from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Nootka Indian</ENAMEX> word patschatl, meaning ‚Äúto give,‚Äù the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">potlatch</ENAMEX> traditionally enabled a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> to demonstrate his prestige to neighboring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tribes</ENAMEX>. For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> or more he gathered up his tribe‚Äôs surplus <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wealth¬†‚Äî¬†considerable</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the boom years</TIMEX> of the fur <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">trade¬†‚Äî¬†to</ENAMEX> throw a huge <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX>. In addition to a splendid <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">feast</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> would hand out gifts of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX>, carvings, jewels, prized iron tools, and, above all, the coveted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hudson‚Äôs Bay Company</ENAMEX> blanket, sometimes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as many as 10,000</NUMEX> of them. While the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> tribe‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> were emptied of everything except bare essentials, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guests</ENAMEX> would depart knowing that in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year or two</TIMEX> they would have to reciprocate if they were not to lose face.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1880s</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> banned this apparently wanton impoverishment, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kwakiutl</ENAMEX>, for whom wealth was measured by what they could give away, continued the practice clandestinely, disguising it as the distribution of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> presents. Today, potlatch is back in the open, updated with transistor radios and other household appliances; the blankets are now electric.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dene National</ENAMEX>
Nowhere is the clash of traditional values and modern industry more acute than it is in the western <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Subarctic</ENAMEX>. Here, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 11,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">native</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peoples</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tribes</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Northwest Territories</ENAMEX> sharing the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Athapaskan</ENAMEX> language have joined as the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">Dene Nation</ENAMEX>. Together with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M√©tis Association</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">descendants</ENAMEX> of intermarried <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> fur <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Plains</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indians</ENAMEX>), they are involved in a tussle with private oil and natural gas <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> to protect land rights and traditional culture.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Proponents</ENAMEX> of an <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Arctic</ENAMEX> gas pipeline passing through <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> lands in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mackenzie Valley</ENAMEX> to northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alberta</ENAMEX> argued that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dene</ENAMEX> need revenues from the pipeline to escape poverty, and that in any case they no longer have an autonomous culture. They drive <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX>, wear Western clothes, speak <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, and play country-and-western music. But <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dene</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX>, fearful of the project‚Äôs environmental impact, insisted their bush-related culture of hunting and fishing could and should be protected (through more self-government) before the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pipeline</ENAMEX> was laid. Ottawa compromised with a shorter pipeline, one just for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX>.
In fact, quite apart from the more tangible facets of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> life that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">Dene Nation</ENAMEX> is trying to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">preserve¬†‚Äî¬†language</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">customs</ENAMEX>, hunting and fishing grounds¬†‚Äîthe traditional values are what remain vitally important. In the past, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">native</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peoples</ENAMEX> moved around the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Subarctic</ENAMEX> in small bands, with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> not institutionalized in a sacred or hereditary role, but chosen very pragmatically for specific hunting skills or on-the-spot organizing abilities. A tough environment demanded tough qualities of interdependence and industriousness, sorely tried by contact with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Europeans</ENAMEX>. The fur trade put an end to their semi-nomadic existence as they settled around the trading posts and became fiercely competitive with one another. A collapse of fur prices after <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX>, coinciding with a rise in prices for consumer goods, left them dependent on federal welfare.
The old culture, however precarious, still exists, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dene</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX>, always pragmatic, fought to protect it with a proper land settlement rather than dependence on pipeline revenues in a world where <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> and gas prices are just as fragile as fur prices once were. Ironically the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Northern</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">natives</ENAMEX> have begun discussions on building their own pipeline which would supply them with a flow of revenue and a boost toward further autonomy. The official name of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwestern Territories</ENAMEX> hasn‚Äôt changed, but it is known among the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">Dene Nation</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Denendeh</ENAMEX> which means ‚Äúour land,‚Äù and as the negotiations between the native <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> continue, this dream moves closer to reality.
The Blackfoot
Our popular image of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">North American Indian</ENAMEX> is conditioned by <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Hollywood‚Äôs stereotype¬†‚Äî¬†feather headdress</ENAMEX>, necklace of scalps, and whooping war dances around the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">campfire¬†‚Äî¬†which</ENAMEX> in fact derived from the prairie <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tribes</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Plains</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indians</ENAMEX>, as they are known to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> anthropologists. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blackfoot</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alberta</ENAMEX> are a classic example. Their name, says the myth, was bestowed on them when an ancestor, on his way to meet another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tribe</ENAMEX>, walked through land burned by prairie fire and blackened his moccasins.
For these great <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hunters</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rocky Mountain foothills</ENAMEX> and prairies, wild game included grizzly and black <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bear</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">antelope</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">deer</ENAMEX>, elk, wild <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sheep</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">goats</ENAMEX>, but the only <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúreal meat‚Äù</ENAMEX> was buffalo. Before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1700s</TIMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX> appeared on the scene, guile was more important than speed, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hunters</ENAMEX> stalked the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">buffalo herd disguised</ENAMEX> with the skins of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">wolf</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">buffalo calves</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Horseback</ENAMEX> hunting brought new skills and prestige to an √©lite that had been given no other duties. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blackfoot</ENAMEX> went to war with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shoshoni and Crow Indians</ENAMEX>, to the south, for their <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX>, and were in turn attacked by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cree</ENAMEX> from the north for their territory‚Äôs great <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">buffalo herds</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buffalo</ENAMEX> was everything to these <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">tribes¬†‚Äî¬†food</ENAMEX>, clothes, and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tents</ENAMEX>; and twelve to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fourteen</NUMEX> buffalo skins were needed to construct a single teepee. So the cultural and ecological shock was all the greater when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">herds</ENAMEX> were exterminated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1870s</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M√©tis</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cree Indians</ENAMEX> were devastatingly efficient with their repeater <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">rifles</ENAMEX>, and the transcontinental railway <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">builders</ENAMEX> made a deliberate policy of clearing the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tracks</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">migrating buffalo</ENAMEX>. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1877</TIMEX>, under the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> government‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Blackfoot Treaty</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">native</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peoples</ENAMEX> gave up their hunting grounds to raise <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cattle</ENAMEX> on reserves instead.
The Micmac
Like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Denes</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific Coast</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Micmac</ENAMEX> found a life of relative plenty when they migrated from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Great Lakes</ENAMEX> to the fishing waters of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nova Scotia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prince</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward Island</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Brunswick</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX> provided a gourmet diet of oysters, clams, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lobster</ENAMEX>, and the rivers teemed with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salmon</ENAMEX>, eel, smelt, and sturgeon. They roasted their <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> whole, boiled it by dropping hot <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stones</ENAMEX> into the cooking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, or ate it smoked.
Like their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algonquin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cousins</ENAMEX> back in the woodlands of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qu√©bec</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ontario</ENAMEX>, they showed a great <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">talent</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">hunting¬†‚Äî¬†moose</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">beaver</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bear</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">caribou</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">seal¬†‚Äî¬†with bow</ENAMEX> and arrow, traps, and harpoon. Before the hunt, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Micmac</ENAMEX> staged a huge <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚Äúeat-all‚</NUMEX>Äù feast to clear out all available provisions, confident the larder would be amply replenished. When they returned, the hunting <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> ended up as the prize delicacy for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guests</ENAMEX> at their ceremonial feasts. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hunters</ENAMEX> lured the moose with a birchbark ‚Äúhorn‚Äù imitating the female call, and if that didn‚Äôt work, they poured <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> from a birchbark receptacle into a pond to reproduce the sound of the female <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">urinating</ENAMEX>. Once the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> had killed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">beast</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> had to carry it home to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cook</ENAMEX>. The choice morsel was the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX>, roasted.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 18th century</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Micmac</ENAMEX> were courted by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">allies</ENAMEX> against the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Louisbourg</ENAMEX> wrought just as much mayhem among them through <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">smallpox</ENAMEX> and typhus. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Some 12,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Micmac</ENAMEX> remain, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> reserves in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">provinces</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qu√©bec.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Modern Realities</ENAMEX>
Today, colorful folklore is being revived as an assertion of the indigenous peoples‚Äô identity. But it is in terms of hard, everyday reality that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indians</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Inuit</ENAMEX> have insisted upon, and won‚ÄÇthe autonomy of partial provincial status for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yukon</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Northwest Territories</ENAMEX>. They are continually pressing for a greater share in the profits of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">uranium</ENAMEX>, and other energy resources found on the lands allotted them in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th century</TIMEX>, before these riches were ever dreamed of.
After years of paternalistic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> of the native <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peoples‚</ENAMEX>Äô property, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> now gives them a free hand in running their own <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX>, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> and shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> financed from oil revenues in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alberta</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Native</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peoples</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Inuit</ENAMEX> prefer to mount their own campaigns against <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">alcoholism</ENAMEX>, the legacy of centuries of colonial abuse, as an alternative to reliance on <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">government-run Alcoholics Anonymous groups</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Inuit</ENAMEX> want their own TV system, and demand that local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">airline</ENAMEX> schedules use <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Inuit</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> names.
Beyond the issues of personal and collective dignity, the earliest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peoples</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> remind us that long before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cabot</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cartier</ENAMEX>, C.P.R. and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C.N.R.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diefenbaker</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trudeau</ENAMEX>, this land was theirs.
