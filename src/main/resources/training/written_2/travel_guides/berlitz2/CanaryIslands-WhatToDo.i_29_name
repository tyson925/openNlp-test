What to Do
Sports
With the wonderfully mild climate of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canaries</ENAMEX>, most sports are a year-round pleasure. Although water sports obviously dominate the scene there are some surprisesÂ<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE"> â€”Â from Canaries</ENAMEX> wrestling to parachuting.
Fishing: <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Deep</ENAMEX>-sea fishing charters for the likes of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">shark</ENAMEX>, barracuda, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">marlin</ENAMEX>, and tuna are available at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Cristianos Harbor</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tenerife</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gran Canaria</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peurto Calero</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lanzarote</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Corralejo</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fuerteventura</ENAMEX>).
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golf</ENAMEX>: The following are mostly 18-hole championship-standard golf <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX>:
On <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tenerife</ENAMEX>, youâ€™ll find a multitude of courses including the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Amarilla Golf and Country Club</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Costa Golf Adeje</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Golf Las AmÃ©ricas</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golf del Sur</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Centro de Golf Los Palos</ENAMEX>. Check with the various <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX> for specific information. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Real Club de Golf de Las Palmas</ENAMEX> (situated on the rim of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bandama</ENAMEX> volcanic crater, and the oldest in all <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>), and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campo de Golf</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maspalomas</ENAMEX>) are both on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gran Canaria</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Club de Golf de Costa Teguise</ENAMEX> is located in the north of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lanzarote</ENAMEX>.
Off <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Road Vehicle Adventures</ENAMEX>: These are becoming very popular, and a selection of them is listed below.
On <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tenerife, Quad Aventura</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TanarÃ¡n Jeep</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Safari</ENAMEX> are both located at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Playa de las AmÃ©ricas</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto de La Cruz</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Miguelâ€™s Jeep-Safaris</ENAMEX> operate on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gran Canaria</ENAMEX>.
Horseback-riding: There are stables with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">instructors</ENAMEX> at a number of locations, one of which is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los Caballos Horse Center</ENAMEX>. Take the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Caleta/FaÃ±abe</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">exit</ENAMEX> off <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-822</ENAMEX> and follow the signs to one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tenerifeâ</ENAMEX>€™s largest private <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plantations</ENAMEX>.
Mountain biking: <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mountain</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bikes</ENAMEX> can be hired without any problems at most major <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX>.
Skydiving: <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Sky Dive, Gran Canaria</ENAMEX>, offer the really adventurous the chance to skydive. Donâ€™t worry, you will be attached to a qualified <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">instructor</ENAMEX> who will control the dive. All you need is the nerve, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27,000</NUMEX> ptas, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">r62.27</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tennis</ENAMEX>: Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">urbanizaciones</ENAMEX> and large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> have their own <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX>. Public <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX> are few and far between.
Walking: All the islands except <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fuerteventura</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lanzarote</ENAMEX> are good for serious walkers. Guided walks and special <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">trails</ENAMEX> are mapped out for those intending to walk <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mount Teide</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tenerife</ENAMEX>, and local tourist information <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> may be able to help with <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">trails</ENAMEX> in other national <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Water Sports</ENAMEX>
Scuba diving: This is becoming more and more popular, and the following <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> offer excursions.
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Diving Center Los Cristianos</ENAMEX>, <www.tenerifesub.home.ml.org>, (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tenerife</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Canary Diving Adventures</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Playa de Taurito; Atlantik Diving</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hotel Club de Mar</ENAMEX>, <www.clubdemar.com/atlantic>, (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gran Canaria</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barrkuda Club</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Playa Blanca</ENAMEX>, (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lanzarote</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Deep Blue</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caleta de Fuste</ENAMEX>, (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fuerteventura</ENAMEX>).
Surfing: A few beaches have the right conditions for surfing. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Playa de MartiÃ</ENAMEX>¡nez at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Puerto de la Cruz</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tenerife</ENAMEX>) is very popular and you can also ride the waves at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Playa de las Canteras</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Palmas</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gran Canaria</ENAMEX>).
Swimming: There are many safe family beaches at all the major <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">breakwaters</ENAMEX> have created lagoon-like conditions. Be careful at all times on all other beaches. Even seemingly calm <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX> can hide dangerous undertows. Never swim alone. Some of the popular beaches have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lifeguards</ENAMEX> and many now use a flag <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">redÂ â€”Â donâ€™t swim</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">yellowÂ â€”Â swim</ENAMEX> with caution; <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">greenÂ â€”Â safe</ENAMEX> to swim.
Water-skiing: This is less popular than windsurfing in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canaries</ENAMEX>, but is still usually available at all the major watersport <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scuba</ENAMEX> diving). Jet-skiing is also widely available.
Windsurfing: The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canaries</ENAMEX> are a windsurfers delight, particularly for the more experienced. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fuerteventura</ENAMEX> is the mecca. The winds at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sotavento Beach</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JandÃ</ENAMEX>­a are regularly strong, and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July</TIMEX> the world championships are held here.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spectator Sports</ENAMEX>
Canaries wrestling (lucha canaria): Rather like sumo wrestling, lucha canaria is a mixture of civilized ritual and caveman huffing and puffing. The basic aim is to throw the other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> to the ground. The roots of the sport are hard to trace. Some say it came from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX>, others that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guanches</ENAMEX> may have devised it.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fiestas</ENAMEX> and folklore exhibitions are still the touristâ€™s best chance of seeing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">la lucha</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vela Latina</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lateens</ENAMEX>, old-fashioned <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canaries</ENAMEX> sailing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rigs</ENAMEX> with triangular sails, race against each other on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoons</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">mornings</TIMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Las Palmas</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gran Canaria</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between April</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September</TIMEX>.
Other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Activities</ENAMEX>
Folklore
The folk music of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canaries</ENAMEX> stands as a reminder that the archipelago has always been a bridge between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New World</ENAMEX>. While most local songs sound <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX>, others would be perfectly at home in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South America</ENAMEX>. Many can be traced far back into the islandsâ€™ history.
Carnaval
For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten days each year</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carnaval</ENAMEX> is the time when <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canarios</ENAMEX> celebrate <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the spring</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Shops</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX> close, and young and old flood the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> in fancy dress, dancing to pulsating <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> rhythms.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">Villages</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> kind or another dress according to chosen themes, with magnificent and often outrageous costumes that can take a whole year to put together. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bands</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dancers</ENAMEX> mingle with the elaborate floats. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Tourists</ENAMEX> are treated with good-natured humor, and many don masks and costumes to join in the fun. The music and dancing continue until late, with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> everywhere.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carnaval</ENAMEX> is biggest and best in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Cruz</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Puerto de la Cruz on Tenerife</ENAMEX> and in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Las Palmas</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gran Canaria</ENAMEX>, where it has all the razzmatazz of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rioâ€™s Carnaval</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mardi Gras</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Orleans</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Visitors</ENAMEX> come from all over the world for these events, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> are often full, so book well ahead if you plan to visit <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at this time of year</TIMEX>.
Corpus Christi
After <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carnaval</ENAMEX>, this is the most spectacular celebration on the islands, though it is of a completely different nature.
As an act of devotion at this religious time, colored volcanic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sand</ENAMEX>, colored <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX>, or flower petals are painstakingly arranged on central paved areas to make up enormous artworks in the form of either elaborate abstract patterns or religious pictures, possibly copied from an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Old</ENAMEX> Master. The most extravagant are to be seen in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">La Orotava and La Laguna on Tenerife</ENAMEX>, but <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Las Palmas</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gran Canaria</ENAMEX> and many other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> throughout the islands also participate. The pictures are ruined, sometimes in a matter of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">moments</TIMEX>, by the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">feet</NUMEX> of the ensuing procession and certainly by the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rainfall</ENAMEX>. Only photographs preserve the memory of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> of hard work.
Colorful fiestas of song and dance, food and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX>, known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RomerÃ­as</ENAMEX>, follow hard on the heels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corpus Christi</ENAMEX> to redress the sobriety.
For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Children</ENAMEX>
With almost guaranteed sunshine, soft sandy beaches, and lots of amusement options off the beach, the more popular <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canary Islands</ENAMEX> are perfect for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> of all ages. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> have special features for the young, ranging from poolside games to babysitters.
Ride a camel. Camel <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX> and rides are popular on the largest islands, where a dromedary (one hump, not <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>) will take you on a variety of trips. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">riders</ENAMEX> are accommodated at a time, slung on yoked seats on either side of the camelâ€™s neck, so itâ€™s a great adventure for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>. The most popular ones are at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maspalomas</ENAMEX> sand dunes on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gran Canaria</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MontaÃ±as del Fuego</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lanzarote</ENAMEX>.
Go-carting. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">carts</ENAMEX> never travel too quickly and are so low to the ground that they canâ€™t tip over. However, being so low they also give a thrilling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sensation</ENAMEX> of speed, and your only problem will be getting your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> off when itâ€™s time to go. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Adult drivers</ENAMEX> are usually welcome too.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Karting Club Tenerife Arona</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">ten minutes</TIMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Playa de las AmÃ©ricas</ENAMEX>) has a normal speed track (admission: 1,300 ptas, [<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">es</ENAMEX>]<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.81</NUMEX>), and a fast track (admission: 1,900 ptas, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">r11.42</ENAMEX>), and various other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX>. Open <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily 10amâ€“8pm</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gran Karting Club</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maspalomas</ENAMEX> (on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gran Canaria</ENAMEX>). An <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">eight-minute</TIMEX> drive will cost <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,500</NUMEX> ptas, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">r9.02</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gran Karting Club</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 km {about a mile}</NUMEX>from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lanzarote</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX>) has a senior track that is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,281 m</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,400 yards</NUMEX>) long with go-<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">carts</ENAMEX> that can reach <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kph</ENAMEX>. (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,500</NUMEX> ptas, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">r9.02</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8 minutes</TIMEX>). There is also a junior track, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">865 m</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">880 yards</NUMEX>). Admission is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,000 ptas</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">r6.01</ENAMEX> for (ages <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12â€“16</NUMEX>), and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">600</NUMEX> ptas, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">r3.61</NUMEX> (ages <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5â€“11</NUMEX>).
Go sailing. There are numerous trips throughout the islands on a variety of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX> and memorable <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">whale</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dolphin safaris</ENAMEX> for spotting pilot <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">whales</ENAMEX> and friendly porpoises. However, do be aware that some of these trips can be too long for younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>. 
Playa <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Juan</ENAMEX> (between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Playa de AmÃ©ricas</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Gigantes</ENAMEX>) offers <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nostramo</ENAMEX>, an original <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1918</TIMEX> schooner; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Playa de AmÃ©ricas/Los Cristianos</ENAMEX> has the only glass bottom <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">catamaran</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto ColÃ³n</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tropical Delfin</ENAMEX>. In south <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tenerife</ENAMEX> you can also try <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bonadea II</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto ColÃ³n</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dock</ENAMEX> pantalan <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>); <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sea Quest</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto ColÃ³n</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dock</ENAMEX> pantalan <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>). 
Pick a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">banana</ENAMEX>. A trip to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">banana</ENAMEX> plantation of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bananera El Guanche</ENAMEX> (see pages <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>), outside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de la Cruz</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tenerife</ENAMEX>, may not initially sound very exciting to a youngster. But the sight of whole <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">banana fists</ENAMEX> growing wild is a novelty and the easy-to-follow video that precedes the self-guided tour makes learning fun. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Adults</ENAMEX> get a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">banana liqueur</ENAMEX> at the end of the tour.
Watch the birdie (and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dolphins</ENAMEX>). There are several animal/bird <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX> in the islands, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Tenerifeâ€™s Loro Park</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Gran Canariaâ€™s Palmitos Park</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lanzaroteâ€™s Guinate Tropical Park</ENAMEX> are all described in the Where To Go section of this guide. Others include the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Parque Las Aguilas</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Cristianos</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arona</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tenerife</ENAMEX>), which as the name implies, has an eagle show, all kinds of other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, and the new <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">JungleRaid</ENAMEX> where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> of all ages can work their way through all kinds of obstacles.
Meet the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guanches</ENAMEX>. Older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> are sure to be fascinated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guanche</ENAMEX> skulls, skeletons, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mummies</ENAMEX> kept at both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museo Canario</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Palmas</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museo ArqueolÃ³gico</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Cruz</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tenerife</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Submarine Trips: see Where To Go</ENAMEX> for info on these excursions. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Puerto ColÃ³n, Playa de AmÃ©ricas</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tenerife</ENAMEX>); <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peurto de MogÃ¡n</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gran Canaria</ENAMEX>); and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Calero</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lanzarote</ENAMEX>).
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shopping</ENAMEX>
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1852</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canary Islands</ENAMEX> were declared a duty-free zone in order to stimulate the development of the archipelago and its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ports</ENAMEX> as an <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Atlantic</ENAMEX> staging base. The plan worked, and the islands still boast some of the largest, busiest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">seaports</ENAMEX> in the whole of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX> the duty-free zone has been transformed into a trade-free zone, into which goods are imported without restrictions from all over the world, and the luxury tax is lower than in most <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>.
Many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> in the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX> stock cameras, calculators, watches, perfume, jewelry, leather goods, spirits, and tobaccoÂ â€”Â in fact, all the things that you can buy in airport duty-free <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>. Aside from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spirits</ENAMEX> and local tobacco, however, there are few real bargains.
Best Buys
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Spirits</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tobacco</ENAMEX> are the best bargains. Local brands of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spirits</ENAMEX> are the cheapest, though rarely of high quality, and most international brands are also bargains. Local cigarettes are fairly rough but cigar <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">smokers</ENAMEX> can find both price and quality. The cigars of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">La Palma</ENAMEX> in particular draw high praise.
For the really keen shopper, uncut gems, silver jewelry, silks, leatherwear, and furs may be of interest.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indian Bazaars</ENAMEX>. Many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> selling luxury goods are owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">entrepreneurs</ENAMEX>. Generally prices are flexible and haggling is accepted as part of the shopping process. You may assume that this is the case in any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop</ENAMEX> where prices are not marked.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mercados</ENAMEX>. The most colorful shopping opportunities in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canaries</ENAMEX> are at the open-air markets usually held on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">mornings</TIMEX>. The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> rastro (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">flea</ENAMEX> market) near the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Palmas</ENAMEX> is particularly good, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mercado de Nuestra SeÃ±ora de Africa</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Cruz de Tenerife</ENAMEX> is recommended at any time.
Many provincial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> hold <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> markets where haggling is, of course, all part of the fun.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Island Products</ENAMEX>. The most celebrated local handicraft is embroidery. Many excursions visit craft workshops where local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> are engaged in delicate needlework on bedspreads, towels, and napkins and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">lace</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">makers</ENAMEX> work on doilies, tablecloths, and other items. The beauty of these places is that you can see that what you are getting is authentic. Your purchase will also help keep the islandâ€™s unique craft industry alive. Do not expect great bargains, however. If you are offered lace or embroidery cheap in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> it was probably made on a machine in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Far East</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pottery</ENAMEX> is another possibility, albeit a more weighty <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>. There are several charmingly primitive styles practiced in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canaries</ENAMEX>.
Centras artesanÃ¬as is a small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> of state-subsidized crafts <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tenerife</ENAMEX> selling pottery, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wood carvings</ENAMEX>, jewelry, and paintings.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last-Day</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Special</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A few days</TIMEX> before you are due to fly home, order some strelitziasÂ â€”Â Bird of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paradise</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>. Compared with the price of exotic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flora</ENAMEX> elsewhere these really are a bargain, even when packed into an air-freight box that makes them very easy to transport <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX>.
Nightlife
In the main tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canaries</ENAMEX> you can find almost any style of nightlife you require, from extravagant and formal floorshows to cheap and rowdy karaoke bars.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cabaret</ENAMEX>. Most of the large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX>, and some smaller ones, boast of an array of cabaret attractions. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">favorites</ENAMEX> include:
