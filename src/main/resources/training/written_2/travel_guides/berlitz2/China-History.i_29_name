A Brief History
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Hundreds of thousands</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> before <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> was to become the world‚Äôs longest-running civilization, the prologue was enacted by means of the flicker of a carefully tended fire. <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Peking Man</ENAMEX>, a forebear of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Homo sapiens</ENAMEX>, achieved a mastery of fire. We might call it the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> invention. Not that he devised flint and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steel</ENAMEX>, matches, or any other way of creating fire. <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Peking Man</ENAMEX> simply learned how to capture flame, perhaps from a forest fire, and keep it alight. He thus enjoyed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> revolutionary luxuries: light and heat.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Technologically</ENAMEX> and sociologically, it was a phenomenal breakthrough: with fire, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> could live year ‚Äôround in one cave, in which cooking and even smelting could be pursued. And so, by <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">600,000 b.c., about 50 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">31 miles</NUMEX>) southwest of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">present-day</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX>, the ancestors of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mankind</ENAMEX> were ready to settle down. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Several hundred thousand</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years later</TIMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marco Polo</ENAMEX> reached the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>, he was astonished by a further development in fire technology. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX>, he announced, used <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">black stones</ENAMEX> dug out of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">mountains</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fuel</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Europeans</ENAMEX> did not yet have a word for ‚Äúcoal,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù</ENAMEX> nor had they discovered a use for it.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Dynasty</ENAMEX>
The confluence of mythology and history in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> took place around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4,000 years ago</TIMEX> during what is referred to as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xia</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hsia</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dynasty</ENAMEX>. This was still the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stone Age</ENAMEX>, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are thought to have made silk from thread produced by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worms</ENAMEX> they cultivated on the leaves of their mulberry <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>. And written language (which evolved as early as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,500 to 5,000</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX>) was already in use, originally by oracles and then by official scribes¬<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">†‚Äî¬†China‚Äôs</ENAMEX> first <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX>.
During the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> of the quasi-legendary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dynasties</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shang</ENAMEX> (from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about the 16th</TIMEX> to 11th <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries b.c.</TIMEX>), the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> developed an interest in art. Careful geometric designs as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dragon</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bird motifs adorned bowls</ENAMEX> and implements. And with the arrival of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bronze Age</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> created bronze <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX> of such beauty and originality that, until modern times, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">archaeologists</ENAMEX> refused to believe they were cast <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,000</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shang Dynasty</ENAMEX> gave rise to the concept of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> under one <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>. Among the advances of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">era</TIMEX> were the introduction of astronomical calculations, chariots, the use of cowrie shells as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX>, the construction of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palaces</ENAMEX> and temples, and the refinement of table manners through the introduction of chopsticks.
The most durable dynasty in the long history of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> followed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shang</ENAMEX>: the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhou</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chou</ENAMEX>), which kept power from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 11th</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX> b.c. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> boundaries were expanded, land reform was instituted, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> were built. But perhaps more significantly, the declining <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhou</ENAMEX> era produced <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most influential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">thinkers</ENAMEX>.
In the rest of the world, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China‚</ENAMEX>Äôs supreme <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sage</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kongfuzi</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">K‚Äôung Fu-tzu</ENAMEX>), is better known by the romanized name <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚ÄúConfucius</ENAMEX>.‚Äù He was born in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">551 b.c.</TIMEX> in what is now <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shandong Province</ENAMEX> in eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>. So profound was his influence that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eleven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emperors</ENAMEX> made pilgrimages to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">birthplace</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Great Teacher</ENAMEX>. You, too, can pay your respects at the vast <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> raised on the site of his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> in the small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qufu</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chufu</ENAMEX>), and at his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tomb</ENAMEX> in the woods just to the north.
The classics of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Confucius</ENAMEX>, while seldom addressing spiritual and metaphysical matters, set standards for social and political conduct that still underlie many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> ways of doing and perceiving. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Confucius</ENAMEX> laid great stress on the proper and harmonious relationships between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ruler</ENAMEX> and subject, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. These relationships were deemed to be hierarchical and dictatorial. If the order was disturbed, dire consequences inevitably resulted. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> who disobeyed the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> would bring disaster upon himself and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, just as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emperor</ENAMEX> who defied the ‚Äúmandate of heaven‚Äù or ignored the good of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX> brought ruin upon the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>.
Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the centuries</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Confucius</ENAMEX> has suffered more changes of fortune than probably any other philosopher. Honored soon after his death as the greatest of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX>, he was later revered as semi-divine; you can still visit temples to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Confucius</ENAMEX> in many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>. During the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Cultural Revolution</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1966‚Äì1976</ENAMEX>), however, he was denounced as a counter-revolutionary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX>. It was only after the death of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mao</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1976</TIMEX>) and the opening of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> to the outside world under more progressive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reformers</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Confucius</ENAMEX>, too, was ‚Äúrehabilitated.‚Äù
Unlike <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Confucius</ENAMEX>, about whose life many specific and even colorful details are known, the philosopher <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laozi</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lao Tse</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lao-Tzu</ENAMEX>) is an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enigma</ENAMEX>. Estimates of his date of birth vary by well over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a century</TIMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> legend even says he taught the young <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Confucius</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Laozi</ENAMEX> is immortalized by his book of thoughts on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>, nature, and the universe, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Daodejing (‚ÄúThe Way</ENAMEX> and Its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Power‚Äù</ENAMEX>), which became the major text of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China‚</ENAMEX>Äôs greatest indigenous religion, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daoism</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taoism</ENAMEX>). With its emphasis on nature, intuition, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX>, paradox (‚Äúthe knowledge which is not knowledge‚Äù), and the cosmic flow known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚Äúthe Way</ENAMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù Daoism</ENAMEX> became the religion of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">philosophers</ENAMEX>.
After the death of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Confucius</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhou Dynasty</ENAMEX> entered a period of strife known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚ÄúWarring States‚</ENAMEX>Äù <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">period</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">475‚Äì221 b.c.</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Orthodox Communist</ENAMEX> histories make the advent of this era the dividing line between a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúslave society‚Äù</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">‚Äúfeudal</ENAMEX> society.‚Äù It would give birth to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emperor</ENAMEX> to unify <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chinese Empire</ENAMEX>
The word <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> is a relatively recent innovation, believed to be derived by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreigners</ENAMEX> from the name <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚ÄúQin‚Äù</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ch‚Äôin</ENAMEX>), the first dynasty to unify <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> after the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Warring States</ENAMEX> period. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>, of course, is a non-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> term. Even <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> still call their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> ‚ÄúZhongguo‚Äù (literally, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚ÄúCentral Kingdom‚Äù</ENAMEX>), referring to its position at the center of the universe in respect to both heaven and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">earth</ENAMEX>.
Under the First <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Emperor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Qinshi Huangdi</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">221‚Äì206 b.c.</ENAMEX>), the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX> was organized along strict lines. Land was divided into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">provinces</ENAMEX> and prefectures, with power vested in a central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> staffed by highly educated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bureaucrats</ENAMEX>. Disapproved books were burned and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dissidents</ENAMEX> executed or exiled. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Canals</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Great Wall</ENAMEX> were built under the auspices of an extensive public works program staffed mostly by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conscripts</ENAMEX>. Official decrees standardized weights and measures and even the axle dimensions of all <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">wagons</ENAMEX> (the latter edict kept transport in the same ruts for countless <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>). You can visit a site of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qin Dynasty</ENAMEX> today at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xi‚Äôan</ENAMEX>, where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Emperor‚</ENAMEX>Äôs terra cotta <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX> was unearthed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1974</TIMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">185</NUMEX>).
The great <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Han Dynasty</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">206 b.c.‚Äìa.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">d. 220</ENAMEX>), which followed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qin</ENAMEX>, consolidated the imperialistic order. Civil <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">servants</ENAMEX> were selected by competitive exams, the centralized government standardized currency, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚ÄúSilk Road‚</ENAMEX>Äù across <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">central Asia</ENAMEX> opened up trade with the rest of the world. On the military front, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Han</ENAMEX> triumphed over marauding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Huns</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Central Asian</ENAMEX> nomads, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> sovereignty was extended almost to today‚Äôs frontiers. The development of a new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">crossbow¬†‚Äî¬†which</ENAMEX> was a longer-range and more accurate weapon than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foes</ENAMEX> could deploy¬<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">†‚Äî¬†ensured Han supremacy</ENAMEX>.
A golden age began, and a university was established in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital city</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chang‚Äôan</ENAMEX> (now <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xi‚Äôan</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Intellectuals</ENAMEX>, who had been harried by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qin</ENAMEX>, were encouraged in their creative endeavors; with the invention of paper, the influence of their writings spread. Sculpture, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ceramics</ENAMEX>, and silk manufacture flourished. And <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buddhism</ENAMEX>, a new religion, came to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> via <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tibet</ENAMEX>; it was to have an enduring effect on <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> life and art.
Like many dynasties before and after, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Han</ENAMEX> succession ended in a new struggle for power and anarchy. As a result, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> was split into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> competing kingdoms. The era of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Three Kingdoms</ENAMEX> lasted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only about half</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a century</TIMEX>, but it had as a legacy some thrilling tales of derring-do that later inspired various plays and a classic <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ming Dynasty</ENAMEX> novel. And the first mention of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX>-drinking in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> occurs in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the third century</TIMEX>, a footnote of fascination for social <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">historians</ENAMEX>.
Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next several hundred years</TIMEX> a series of dynasties, some led by foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rulers</ENAMEX>, held power under almost constant threat from usurpers at home and abroad. During this unsettled period many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> moved to the south; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yangzi</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Yangtze</ENAMEX>) valley developed into the leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">center</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> culture. As for foreign invaders, they brought new ideas but, as often happened in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> history, were assimilated into the more advanced society of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Middle Kingdom</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National</ENAMEX> unity and strength were renewed under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sui Dynasty</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">a.d. 581‚Äì618</ENAMEX>), a brief prelude to the highest achievements of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> art. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sui</ENAMEX> built a stately new metropolis at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chang‚Äôan</ENAMEX>, near the site of the old <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Han</ENAMEX> capital (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">present-day</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Xi‚Äôan</ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shaanxi Province</ENAMEX>). They also began work on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Grand Canal</ENAMEX>, which was to link the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX>-growing areas of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Yangzi valley</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX>, an engineering achievement comparable to the construction of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Great Wall</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Glory of the Tang</ENAMEX>
In the realm of culture, no era of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> history has surpassed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tang</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T‚Äôang</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dynasty</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">618‚Äì907</ENAMEX>), during which poetry and art reached a brilliant apex. <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">China‚Äôs Imperial Academy of Letters</ENAMEX> was founded, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about 900 years</TIMEX> before any such <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX> was established in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> known printed book, a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX> scripture, was published in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">868</NUMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital city</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chang‚Äôan</ENAMEX>, had a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than a million</NUMEX>, which was far more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> than contemporaneous <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> had. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chang‚Äôan</ENAMEX>, extravagant <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palaces</ENAMEX> and temples were interspersed with markets stocked with exotica from as far away as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Byzantium</ENAMEX>. Foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> journeyed here to purchase silk, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">porcelain</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spices</ENAMEX>, and, by so doing, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">incidentally</ENAMEX> introduced the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> to foreign ideas.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Scholars</ENAMEX>, poets, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> all achieved prominence. Encyclopedias were compiled, and poetry evolved a metric system and lines that rhymed. As <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buddhism</ENAMEX> gained strength and took on a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> character, it inspired the construction of great temples and pagodas adorned with frescoes and statues. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Artists</ENAMEX> painted sensitive landscapes and perfected the subtle brushwork of calligraphy. Sculptors excelled in portraying lifelike human, animal, and religious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">figures</ENAMEX>.
Yet by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the beginning of the tenth century</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Tang</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rulers</ENAMEX> had lost their grip on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. Revenues from tax collection dwindled, ambitious palace eunuchs plotted, reform schemes failed, and rebellious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> threatened. The emperors distributed their largess to too many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">warlords</ENAMEX>, hoping to pacify them. By <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">907</NUMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> could see, through all the turmoil and confusion, that the dynasty had lost the ‚Äúmandate of heaven,‚Äù and so it was that the last of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tang</ENAMEX> monarchs abdicated.
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">historians</ENAMEX> designate <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next 50 years</TIMEX> as the era of ‚ÄúThe Five <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dynasties</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ten Kingdoms</ENAMEX>.‚Äù This transitional period was marred by political and military infighting, and by rivalry, intrigue, and cruelty. Then, an able general named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhaokuangyin</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chao K‚</ENAMEX>Äôuang-yin) came onto the scene and founded the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Song</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sung</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dynasty</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">960‚Äì1280</ENAMEX>), which ensured <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> cultural supremacy for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next three centuries</TIMEX>.
The number of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> increased dramatically under the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Song</ENAMEX>, mostly in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Yangzi valley</ENAMEX> and in the southeast. Where there were <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>, there were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX>, and artisans. Movable type revolutionized printing, books became more common, and literacy increased; <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> published works on botany, astronomy, mathematics, and geography. Emperors appointed court <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painters</ENAMEX>, and glazed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">porcelain</ENAMEX> was received abroad with admiration and awe.
But while art and scholarship continued to thrive, the political and military situation deteriorated under the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Song</ENAMEX>. Foreign invaders chipped away at the fringes of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Taxpayers groaned</ENAMEX> under the burden of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX> and the tribute paid to foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">rivals</ENAMEX> and complained about the luxuries of palace life. Disaster was inevitable: invaders from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manchuria</ENAMEX> forced the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Song</ENAMEX> to retreat to the south. And the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mongol</ENAMEX> invaders, headed by the redoubtable <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Genghis Khan</ENAMEX>, swept across <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>, bringing the whole <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> under foreign rule for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time.
Under <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mongol Rule</ENAMEX>
A poignant drama signaled the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mongol</ENAMEX> conquest of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1279‚Äì1368</ENAMEX>). After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20 years</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Song</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">armies</ENAMEX> were finally ready to capitulate. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy emperor</ENAMEX> was hidden aboard a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ship</ENAMEX>. But when it was surrounded by enemy <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">craft</ENAMEX>, the last of the loyal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commanders</ENAMEX> seized the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eight-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">monarch</ENAMEX> in his <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX> and leaped with him to death in the sea.
The new era, known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yuan Dynasty</ENAMEX>, lasted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">less than a century</TIMEX>. Creativity declined, but the new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ruler</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kublai Khan</ENAMEX> (who was <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandson</ENAMEX> of the great <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Genghis Khan</ENAMEX>), had an open mind and a generally humane attitude towards his new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>. He appointed <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bureaucrats</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX> to help rule the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. Foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">historians</ENAMEX> generally conclude that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kublai Khan</ENAMEX> became an ‚Äúalmost authentic‚Äù <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emperor</ENAMEX>, that the conquerors changed more profoundly than the conquered.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> of the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX> was built on the site of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">present-day</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> and was called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚ÄúDadu‚Äù</ENAMEX> or, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mongolian</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚ÄúCambaluc‚Äù¬†‚Äî¬†spelled Kanbalu</ENAMEX> by that most renowned of medieval <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">travelers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marco Polo</ENAMEX>. His account of the vast new capital throbs with admiration for the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palaces</ENAMEX> and bazaars and the profusion of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">shade trees</ENAMEX>. He regards with wonder the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Great Khan‚</ENAMEX>Äôs religious tolerance, all-encompassing generosity, and admirable taste in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wives</ENAMEX>. He reports all manner of innovations, not least the invention of paper money. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Counterfeiting</ENAMEX>, he reports, had also been discovered.)
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marco Polo‚</ENAMEX>Äôs account of life in legendary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cathay</ENAMEX> was received with incredulity in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, where it was suggested that his imagination had run wild. What else could the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venice</ENAMEX> make of his report that the ‚Äúnoble and magnificent <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kin-sai‚Äù</ENAMEX> (now <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hangzhou</ENAMEX>) had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridges</ENAMEX>, many so high that sailing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX> could pass under them? In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">schoolboys</ENAMEX> came to call a whopping exaggeration a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">‚ÄúMarco Polo</ENAMEX>.‚Äù
With the death of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kublai Khan</ENAMEX> (in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1294</TIMEX>, at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 80</TIMEX>), the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mongols</ENAMEX> started to lose their grip on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>. The great emperor‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">successors</ENAMEX> lacked his vision and vigor. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Insurrection</ENAMEX> was in the air, met by oppression and resulting in ever more sustained <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX>. Finally, a full-scale uprising led by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peasant general</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhuyuanzhang</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Chu Y√ºan-chang</ENAMEX>), routed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yuan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rulers</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1368</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zhuyuanzhang</ENAMEX> assumed the throne of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Middle Kingdom</ENAMEX>, founding yet another dynasty of brilliant promise¬<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">†‚Äî¬†the Ming</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Elegance of Ming</ENAMEX>
In <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX>, the word <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ming</ENAMEX> is written as a composite of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">‚Äúsun‚Äù and ‚Äúmoon,‚</ENAMEX>Äù which are combined to mean ‚Äúbrilliant‚Äù or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúglorious.‚Äù In fact, the dynasty (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1368‚Äì1644</ENAMEX>) didn‚Äôt quite live up to its name. Beauty was achieved in architecture, sculpture, and the decorative arts. But literature, now serving an ever-wider <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX>, produced few masterworks, and philosophy saw no new developments. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Science</ENAMEX>, which had been far more advanced than in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, was so gravely neglected that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> became a technological backwater.
Perhaps to compensate for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mongol</ENAMEX> interlude, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ming</ENAMEX> emperors opted for traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> values. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">keeper</ENAMEX> of the ‚Äúmandate of heaven‚Äù played his role to the autocratic hilt, while <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bureaucrats</ENAMEX> kept their jobs (and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heads</ENAMEX>) by paying him lip service.
Conservatism and hostility to foreign ideas, however, couldn‚Äôt be absolutely maintained. During the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ming</ENAMEX> era, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> imported <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tobacco</ENAMEX>, pineapples, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peanuts</ENAMEX>, and syphilis. Thanks to the emancipated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Confucian</ENAMEX> tradition, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">missionaries</ENAMEX> were usually welcomed, although they hardly achieved mass conversions. From the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jesuits</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> learned mathematics and astronomy; the old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">observatory</ENAMEX> still stands in downtown <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX>.
At first the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Ming</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX> were moved south to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Yangzi River</ENAMEX> port of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nanjing (‚ÄúSouthern Capital‚Äù</ENAMEX>), but at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the beginning of the 15th century</TIMEX> the capital returned to what was now renamed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beijing (‚ÄúNorthern Capital‚Äù</ENAMEX>). Here Ming <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architects</ENAMEX> and artisans produced some of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most elegant <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palaces</ENAMEX>, temples, and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX>, including the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Forbidden City</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX> of Heaven, masterpieces that survive <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>.
The move northward made the supervision of defense efforts on the ever-sensitive borders of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX> easier. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Ming</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rulers</ENAMEX> oversaw the construction and renovation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Great Wall sections</ENAMEX> that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> visit <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, but this wall<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">-</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> eventually proved incapable of keeping out enemies. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th century</TIMEX>, after repeated forays, infiltrations, and invasions, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manchuria</ENAMEX> capitalized on domestic upheavals in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> to take power in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX>, almost by default. Consolidating control over the rest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, though, was a long and brutal business. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manchu</ENAMEX> invaders called their new dynasty the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qing</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ch‚Äôing</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fated</ENAMEX> to be the last of all the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dynasties</ENAMEX>, it held power until modern times (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1644‚Äì1911</ENAMEX>).
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pigtails</ENAMEX> and Prosperity
The invading <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚Äúbarbarians,‚Äù the Manchu</ENAMEX>, adopted all the refinements of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> civilization, installing a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX> so conservative that it began to hold back progress. But for all their Confucian outlook and traditionalism, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manchu</ENAMEX> imposed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> singular feature of their own culture: the wearing of pigtails. Ironically, this was one peculiarity the rest of the world came to consider typically <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the most dynamic emperors was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kangxi</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">K‚Äôang-hsi</ENAMEX>), who reigned at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">almost the same time</TIMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Louis XIV</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>. He presided over a period of prosperity and positive achievement, rebuilding <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX>, encouraging scholarship, and expanding the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX> to its greatest area. By the standards of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">predecessors</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kangxi</ENAMEX> lived modestly enough; his concubines numbered <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">no more than 300</NUMEX>.
Under the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Emperor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Qianlong</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ch‚Äôien Lung</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kangxi‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandson</ENAMEX>, conflict arose between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Europe‚</ENAMEX>Äôs empires and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Middle Kingdom</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">England‚Äôs King George III</ENAMEX> sent an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emissary</ENAMEX> to negotiate conventional diplomatic and trade relations. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emperor</ENAMEX> flatly turned him down but thanked him for showing such ‚Äúsubmissive loyalty in sending this tribute mission.‚Äù No insult appears to have been intended, even though the message referred to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX> as ‚Äúthe <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lonely remoteness</ENAMEX> of your island, cut off from the world by intervening wastes of sea.‚Äù <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> sincerely believed itself to be the center of the world: it had nothing to learn or gain from so-called foreign devils. But such sublime self-assurance was to be short-lived.
The soaring demand in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX>, silk, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">porcelain</ENAMEX> brought increasing pressure for freer trade. However, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> were stubborn. Needing no commodities, they would accept only silver bullion in exchange for goods, thus undermining <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Britain‚</ENAMEX>Äôs balance of payments. Then, at about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the turn of the 19th century</TIMEX>, wily foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> thought of an alternative medium of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">payment¬†‚Äî¬†opium</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Tons</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> were brought into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1839</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> finally cracked down on this drain on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">treasury</ENAMEX>, which was also causing mass addiction among the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Some 20,000</NUMEX> chests of opium were confiscated from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">merchants</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guangzhou</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canton</ENAMEX>). Retaliation came <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year later</TIMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Opium Wars</ENAMEX>, which culminated in a series of ‚Äúunequal treaties‚Äù forced on an increasingly weak <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Manchu</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> was obliged to open major <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ports</ENAMEX> to foreign political and economic penetration; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> was ceded to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>.
Infinitely more costly in human terms was the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Taiping Rebellion</ENAMEX>, which began in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1850</TIMEX> as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peasant</ENAMEX> revolt. There was a struggle between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qing Dynasty</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rebels</ENAMEX> determined to overthrow such traditional values as respect for religion, private property, and male supremacy. The revolt lasted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14 years</TIMEX> and cost more lives than would <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">I.</ENAMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> finally won, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> would never be the same.
This became patently clear during the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Sino-Japanese War</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1894‚Äì1895</NUMEX>, in which the inadequacy of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX> was starkly displayed. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> and Western <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">powers</ENAMEX> were dismantling the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Empire</ENAMEX>. Demands for reform won the support of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emperor</ENAMEX>, but his notoriously scheming <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aunt</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Empress Dowager Cixi</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tz‚Äôu Hsi</ENAMEX>), edged him off the throne. Soon after, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cixi</ENAMEX> had the chance to exploit the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Boxer Rebellion</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1900</TIMEX>), a revolt against foreign influence. It was finally put down by the intervention of all the great powers, which joined together in an unprecedented alliance. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> was saddled with payment of a humiliating indemnity and a further loss of respect.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elderly empress</ENAMEX> died in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1908</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX> after the mysterious death of her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nephew</ENAMEX>, the unseated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emperor</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heir</ENAMEX> apparent was a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prince</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Puyi¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†hardly the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> the dynasty and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> needed in the face of civil disorder and foreign threats. Less than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three years later</TIMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX> uprising took place in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wuhan</ENAMEX> and quickly won widespread support. The success of the revolution surprised many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observers</ENAMEX>. It came so suddenly that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sun Yat-sen</ENAMEX>, the inveterate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">revolutionary</ENAMEX> who had led several earlier insurrections, was still abroad at the time. He returned in triumph to accept the presidency of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Republic</ENAMEX>. With a stroke of the brush, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manchu Dynasty</ENAMEX> and its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emperor</ENAMEX> surrendered in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1911</TIMEX>. The imperial tradition, going back <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, was snapped like a twig.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Unity Eludes</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chinese</ENAMEX>
But the path of the new <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">republic</ENAMEX> was strewn with dangers. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">warlord</ENAMEX> seized power in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX>, hoping to restore the monarchy. A harried <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sun Yat-sen</ENAMEX> then moved his new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kuomintang</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> south to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guangzhou</ENAMEX>.
Towards the end of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hostilities</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> entered <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War I</ENAMEX> on the side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Allies</ENAMEX>. But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Versailles Peace</ENAMEX> conference proved a bitter disappointment when <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>, and not <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>, won control over <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Germany‚</ENAMEX>Äôs former holdings in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shandong Province</ENAMEX>. Frustration inspired protest demonstrations. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> of increasing bitterness were the foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">powers</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX>, as agitation for drastic social reforms caught the imagination of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> and factory <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1921</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Communist Party of China</ENAMEX> (with a total membership of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">53</NUMEX>) held its first national <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">congress</ENAMEX>, in secret, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shanghai</ENAMEX>. A cautious <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Communist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">alliance</ENAMEX> was arranged with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nationalist Party</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guomindang</ENAMEX>) in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1924</TIMEX>. Disappointed with the Western <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">powers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sun Yat-sen</ENAMEX> turned for support to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> of the young <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kremlin</ENAMEX> obliged by sending political and military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisors</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Nationalists</ENAMEX>. In turn, Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sun</ENAMEX> dispatched <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">his 37-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">follower</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chiang Kai-shek</ENAMEX>, as head of a mission to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moscow</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sun</ENAMEX>, who rallied the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> with his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Three Principles¬†‚Äî¬†Nationalism</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Democracy</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">People‚Äôs Livelihood¬†‚Äî¬†died</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1925</TIMEX>. His <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">successor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chiang Kai-shek</ENAMEX>, took over the campaign, moving the capital to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nanjing</ENAMEX>.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1927</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chiang</ENAMEX> turned on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Communists</ENAMEX> as well as on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leftists</ENAMEX> within his own <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX>, unleashing a vehement, bloody purge. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Communists</ENAMEX>, who had already organized the support of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peasants</ENAMEX>, gathered strength in the south. But, facing increasing military pressure, they set forth on the epic Long <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX> to northwest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>, a distance of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">some 10,000 perilous kilometers</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">over 6,200 miles</NUMEX>). During one of history‚Äôs greatest strategic retreats, one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founders</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Communist Party</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mao Zedong</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mao Tse-tung</ENAMEX>), was chosen as party <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX>. It was a mandate he was to retain for the rest of his life.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bitter Years of War</ENAMEX>
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1931</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> seized <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Manchuria</ENAMEX>, proclaiming it the ‚Äúindependent‚Äù state of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manchukuo</ENAMEX>. This was to be a fatal prologue to <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War</ENAMEX> II. Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next few years</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> advanced into several other areas of northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chiang Kai-shek</ENAMEX> was so busy tracking down the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Communists</ENAMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foe</ENAMEX> merited only casual attention. At <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> point <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chiang</ENAMEX> himself was kidnapped by some of his own <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX>, a sensational interlude known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sian</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xi‚Äôan</ENAMEX>) Incident. Its aim was to convince him to form a united front with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Communists</ENAMEX>.
But by the time concerted action could be planned, the invaders had moved onto a broad offensive. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> juggernaut crushed all the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> in the big coastal <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> as well as in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nanjing</ENAMEX>. The retreat ended in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1938</TIMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Nationalist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> dug in behind the gorges of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Yangzi River</ENAMEX>, in the last-ditch capital of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chongqing</ENAMEX>.
Even before entering <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> was supporting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">armies</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chiang Kai-shek</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fuel</ENAMEX>, and transport. However, once in the field, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> soon became disheartened with the confusion, corruption, and stalling. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chiang</ENAMEX>, they believed, was hoarding everything from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">airplanes</ENAMEX> in the struggle against the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese Communists</ENAMEX> and leaving the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Allies</ENAMEX> to worry about the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX>.
When <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> surrendered in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1945</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chiang Kai-shek</ENAMEX> could share the victory toasts as one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Allies</ENAMEX>. But he was already losing the battle of his lifetime¬†‚Äî¬†for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>. By V-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J Day</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15 August</TIMEX>), when <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> officially surrendered, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese Communists</ENAMEX> controlled an area inhabited by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly one-quarter</NUMEX> of the nation‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. At first the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> tried to mediate between the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Communists</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Nationalists</ENAMEX>, even while continuing to supply the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Nationalists</ENAMEX>. But any chances for postwar cooperation between right and left were wrecked in a matter of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> was sinking into civil war.
Despite some early setbacks, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Communist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">armies</ENAMEX> became an overwhelming <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX>. They were greeted as liberators by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peasants</ENAMEX> and met only desultory resistance in most <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Nationalists</ENAMEX>, in despair, fell back and finally fled the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, moving the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Nationalist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> and countless national treasures to the island of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX>, pledging to fight their way back <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX>.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Tiananmen Square</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 October 1949</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mao Zedong</ENAMEX> proclaimed the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">‚ÄúPeople‚Äôs Republic of China</ENAMEX>.‚Äù After <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few decades</TIMEX> of violent transition, the most populous <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> in the world was committed to communism.
Imposing the New Order
Before any grandiose plans could be implemented, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China‚</ENAMEX>Äôs fledgling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rulers</ENAMEX> had to rebuild society and a crippled economy. Agrarian reform was the first revolutionary innovation, followed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> under <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Party</ENAMEX> control.
Hardly had the groundwork been laid when <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> entered the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Korean War</ENAMEX>, sending ‚Äúvolunteers‚Äù to fight against <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX>-led <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Nations</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX>. Relations between the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> suffered, but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beijing‚Äôs</ENAMEX> ties with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moscow</ENAMEX> prospered in comradely harmony. The world‚Äôs first communist <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USSR</ENAMEX> shipped technical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisors</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">rubles</NUMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>, which patterned many new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX>. As in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">farms</ENAMEX> were collectivized and heavy industry took economic precedence.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mao Zedong‚Äôs ‚ÄúGreat Leap Forward‚Äù</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1959</TIMEX>) was designed to mobilize the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">masses</ENAMEX> in a crash program of economic growth, but it kept the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> in turmoil and brought unconvincing results. At about the time the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leap</ENAMEX> was suddenly reversed, relations between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> plunged from polite to frosty to hostile. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> cut off relations with the world and tested its own nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bomb</ENAMEX>.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">From 1966 to 1976</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> was convulsed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Millions</NUMEX> of young <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Red Guards</ENAMEX> went on the rampage, and the whole <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> set about memorizing the maxims in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Mao‚Äôs Little Red Book</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Thousands</NUMEX> perished and much of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China‚</ENAMEX>Äôs cultural heritage was destroyed as a vestige of feudalism. Changes came in quick succession in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1970s</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Nixon</ENAMEX>, visited <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1972</TIMEX>, thus normalizing relations between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 1976</TIMEX> the widely admired <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prime minister</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhou Enlai</ENAMEX>, died. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Eight months later</TIMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September</TIMEX>, death came to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mao</ENAMEX> himself.
Mao‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">widow</ENAMEX>, the one-time film <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actress</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jiangqing</ENAMEX>, and her close <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">associates</ENAMEX> (the so-called <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Gang</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX>) were arrested, tried, and imprisoned for encouraging the excesses of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Cultural Revolution</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Thousands</NUMEX> who had suffered during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fervid 1960s and 1970s</TIMEX>, including the forceful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pragmatist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Deng Xiaoping</ENAMEX>, were rehabilitated. At the same time as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mao Zedong‚</ENAMEX>Äôs portraits and slogans were being removed from billboards and schoolrooms, a new flexibility was coming to the fore. Top priority was now assigned to the modernization of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China‚</ENAMEX>Äôs underdeveloped economy. This opened the way for major scientific and commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchanges</ENAMEX> with the West. And foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> soon began flooding into the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> to see the splendors that had been inaccessible for so long.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX> ‚ÄúSupreme <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leader‚Äù Deng Xiaoping</ENAMEX> set into motion a rapid <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Westernization of China‚Äôs</ENAMEX> economy. Deng‚Äôs death and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hong Kong‚</ENAMEX>Äôs return to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> sovereignty in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX> together marked another new era in the creation of a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New China</ENAMEX>, this time as an economic superpower designed to rival the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 21st century</TIMEX>. 
In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> important respect, however, nothing has changed all that much since the time of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Marco Polo</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> is still a unique experience, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> like no other.
