A Brief History
It seems like a rather strange site for a colonial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mississippi</ENAMEX> was untamed when the location was found by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> and changed course regularly through the vast flat delta its power had created. The site is below sea level (even below river level), hot and sticky in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the long summer</TIMEX>, surrounded by pestilential swamps, vulnerable to every flood and hurricane, and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">more than 100 miles</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">160 km</NUMEX>) from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gulf of MexicoÂ â€”Â</ENAMEX> or anywhere else. How did it hope to compete with the great coastal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">settlements</ENAMEX> in other parts of the New World?
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Native Americans</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Choctaws</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tribes</ENAMEX>) who settled here <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> before the arrival of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">colonists</ENAMEX> lived a simple life. Although they needed to avoid water <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">snakes</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">alligators</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>-carrying <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes</ENAMEX>, they enjoyed a cornucopia of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seafood</ENAMEX> and game, flavoring it with a hot <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sauce</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Creoles</ENAMEX> would later adopt. They used the waterways of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mississippi</ENAMEX> delta as <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">highways</ENAMEX>, navigating their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dugout canoes</ENAMEX> through the impenetrable and ever-changing maze of bayous.
The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> to see the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mississippi</ENAMEX> was the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Conquistador</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hernando de Soto</ENAMEX>, brother-in-law of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Balboa</ENAMEX> and the discoverer of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> connection was to begin in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1682</TIMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">RenÃ© Robert Cavelier</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sieur de La Salle</ENAMEX>, claimed for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> a huge swath of territory radiating from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mississippi</ENAMEX>. In honor of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Louis XIV</ENAMEX>, he gave it the name <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Louisiane</ENAMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Seventeen</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years later</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> sent a further expedition, led by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierre le Moyne</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sieur</ENAMEX> dâ€™Iberville. Along with his younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jean-Baptiste</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sieur de Bienville</ENAMEX>, he established several tentative settlements along the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mississippi</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1718</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bienville</ENAMEX> marked the spot for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Orleans</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brothers</ENAMEX> are remembered <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> as the true <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founders</ENAMEX> of both the state and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cityÂ â€”Â Bienville</ENAMEX> later served as the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Louisiana</ENAMEX>. Interestingly, they were <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Creole FrenchÂ â€”Â offspring</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nationals</ENAMEX> born in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Montreal</ENAMEX>.
Hanky-Panky by Law
Meanwhile, a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> with an eye for chance had ingratiated his way into the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Versailles</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">John Law</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Scotsman</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">financier</ENAMEX>, and high-rolling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gambler</ENAMEX>, on the run from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX> after a fatal duel, saw the possibility of promoting this distant marshland as a paradise. Luckily for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Orleans</ENAMEX>, his scheme was a remarkable success.
Law brokered a deal with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>, giving him a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25-year</TIMEX> charter to develop the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Louisiana Territory</ENAMEX>. All he needed were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">settlers</ENAMEX>, whom he lured with a campaign of propaganda. On posters Law distributed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Orleans</ENAMEX> was pictured as a prosperous seaport. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawâ</ENAMEX>€™s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> arrived after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> at sea, the truth of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mississippi Bubble</ENAMEX> was plain. The only housing available was huts or <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tents</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX> were generally quagmires. But there was nowhere else to go, so the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pioneers</ENAMEX> were forced to pitch in and try to survive.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Lawâ</ENAMEX>€™s promotional activities werenâ€™t confined to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>. He signed up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 10,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Germans</ENAMEX>, mostly <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rhinelanders</ENAMEX>, to share the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œgolden futureâ€</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Louisiana</ENAMEX>. Today, west of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Orleans</ENAMEX> along what is called the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">German Coast</ENAMEX>, you can see <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> with names like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hahnville, Kraemer</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Des Allemands</ENAMEX>. Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">descendants</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pioneers</ENAMEX>, however, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Frenchified</ENAMEX> their names, thus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delmaire</ENAMEX> was originally <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edelmeyer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fauquel</ENAMEX> was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vogel</ENAMEX>.
Black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">slaves</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX> also arrived in the earliest years of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1724</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bienville</ENAMEX> enacted the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Code Noir</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Black Code</ENAMEX>), which regulated the conditions of slavery and the rights of free <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX>. The code, more liberal than the laws elsewhere in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South</ENAMEX>, remained in force in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Louisiana</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a century</TIMEX>. As for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mississippi Bubble</ENAMEX>, it burst in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1720</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> came out of the deal bankrupt and with huge pieces of land considered to be worthless. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Law</ENAMEX> died in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1729</TIMEX>, dispossessed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venice</ENAMEX>.
High <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Society</ENAMEX>
By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the middle of the 18th century</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Orleans</ENAMEX> had grown into a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">townÂ â€”Â not</ENAMEX> exactly self-sufficient, but beyond the survival stage. To carry this a step farther, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marquis de Vaudreuil, Governor Bienvilleâ</ENAMEX>€™s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">successor</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1743</TIMEX>, attempted to transform <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Orleans</ENAMEX> into an overseas <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Versailles</ENAMEX>. A bon <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vivant</ENAMEX> who held extravagant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vaudreuil</ENAMEX> and his elegant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> presided over a sort of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">â€œGolden Ageâ</ENAMEX>€ of social grace, when the colonial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elite</ENAMEX> were invited to plays, musicales, and balls. His serious business included organizing the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> system of man-made levees to protect the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mississippi</ENAMEX>. At the same time, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cronies</ENAMEX> were busily pocketing bribes, as was the custom in the self-financing <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> colonial service. He can therefore be considered as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX> of a grand old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Louisiana</ENAMEX> traditionÂ â€”Â political corruption.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Â¡Caramba</ENAMEX>!
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Treaty of Fontainebleau</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1762</TIMEX> brought a shattering blow to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Louisiana</ENAMEX>. Overnight, it appeared, they had been handed over to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles III</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">SpainÂ â€”Â though the treaty</ENAMEX> was not announced until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1764</TIMEX>. It all made perfect sense to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis XV</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cousin</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles</ENAMEX> (both were <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bourbons</ENAMEX>), for the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">French and Indian War</ENAMEX>, known in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> as the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Seven Years War</ENAMEX>, had been disastrous for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">interests</ENAMEX> abroad. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> won <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> and everything east of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mississippi</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX>. To <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Louis</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Louisiana</ENAMEX> was now isolated in a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX>-ruled part of the world, a money-losing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outpost</ENAMEX> that seemed to have no future.
It must have come as an almost unbearable shock to the patriotic <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frenchmen</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Orleans</ENAMEX> to be told that they were <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX>. Waiting for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first Spanish</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX> to arrive put a huge strain on the disillusioned society. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Governor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Antonio de Ulloa</ENAMEX> finally sailed up the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mississippi</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1766</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four years</TIMEX> after the treaty was signed, a crashing storm erupted, as if an omen for the climate ahead. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX>, a scholarly retired naval <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> with good intentions, was accompanied by a contingent of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX>, most of retirement age.
The high-society frolics of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Vaudreuil</ENAMEX> era were over; the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> governorâ€™s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> froze out the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Creole</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ladies</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Orleans</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> invitation lists. French-speaking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> protested the snub with a petition and a demonstration that got out of control and turned into violence. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> called it treason. The harassed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ulloa</ENAMEX> could take no more and sailed into exile.
The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX> sent from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lieutenant General</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Don Alejandro Oâ€™Reilly</ENAMEX>, cracked down on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rebels</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oâ€™Reilly</ENAMEX> created the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cabildo</ENAMEX>, or town <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">council</ENAMEX>, and led <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Orleans</ENAMEX> toward prosperity. But he is remembered with bitterness. To assert <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spainâ€™s</ENAMEX> authority and extinguish dissent, he ordered the execution of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Creole</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rebels</ENAMEX>. They stood before the firing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">squad</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Esplanade</ENAMEX> near where it crosses <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Frenchmen Street</ENAMEX>, named in their memory.
The Acadians
During the troubled <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> era, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> exiles from eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">CanadaÂ â€”Â Acadians</ENAMEX>, shortened to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CajunsÂ â€”Â </ENAMEX> migrated to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Louisiana</ENAMEX>. For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">territory</ENAMEX> had been the target of a struggle between the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>, and the emphatic <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> victory in the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">French and Indian War</ENAMEX> forced them to leave, when they refused to swear allegiance to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Crown</ENAMEX>.
The hubbub of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Orleans</ENAMEX> was too much for them and they settled into the surrounding countryside. Unlike the other <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">colonists</ENAMEX>, who eventually melted into the culture, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cajuns</ENAMEX> kept to themselves in the bayou, retaining their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17th-century</TIMEX> language and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">customs</ENAMEX>. Only in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 20th century</TIMEX> did they start to communicate in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> as well. The present <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cajun</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Louisiana</ENAMEX>, numbering in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds of thousands</NUMEX>, is still largely parochial. But one aspect of their culture, their spicy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cuisine</ENAMEX>, has become fashionable across the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> and, more recently, the world.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">French Quarter</ENAMEX>
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1788</TIMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX>, lighting a devotional candle in the private <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">chapel</ENAMEX> in his home on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Chartres Street</ENAMEX>, started a fire which spread, fanned by the wind, to devour <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly half</NUMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1794</TIMEX> another blaze swept through the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Orleans</ENAMEX> looked on the positive side of these disasters. Taking note of the obvious vulnerability of the old wooden <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> set up new building standards. Tile roofs became the rule, and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> with more than a single <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX> had to be built of brick. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish-</ENAMEX>colonial touches such as garden <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">patios</ENAMEX>, shaded <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">balconies</ENAMEX>, and adornments of wrought iron gave the area its almost <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX> air. This new <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> became known, ironically, as the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Quarter</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vieux CarrÃ©.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Revolutionary Antics</ENAMEX>
During the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Revolution</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Orleans</ENAMEX> plunged in on the revolutionist side. It wasnâ€™t only enthusiasm for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yankees</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> declared war on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1779</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Orleans</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Don Bernardo de GÃ¡lvez</ENAMEX>, seized the chance to help the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">colonists</ENAMEX> in their struggle against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George III</ENAMEX>, and led raiding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> that kept the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> outposts along the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mississippi</ENAMEX> on the defensive.
After the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Revolution</ENAMEX> came the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">French Revolution</ENAMEX> and a new world order. The ambitions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NapolÃ©on Bonaparte</ENAMEX> stretched as far as the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Western Hemisphere</ENAMEX>, and an influx of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> aristocrats buoyed <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> sentiments. By the secret <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Treaty of Ildefonso</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1800</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> regained <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Louisiana</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38 years</TIMEX>.
But in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1803</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">only three years</TIMEX> after retaking it, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> sold <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Louisiana</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$15 million</NUMEX>. It was a controversial amount at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">timeÂ â€”Â more</ENAMEX> than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US Treasury</ENAMEX> ownedÂ â€”Â but the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Louisiana Purchase</ENAMEX>, as it became known, covered land from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rockies</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gulf of Mexico</ENAMEX>, and almost doubled the area of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. The deal turned out to be the bargain of all timeÂ â€”Â something like <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">four cents</NUMEX> an acre for what became <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iowa</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arkansas</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Missouri</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nebraska</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Dakota</ENAMEX>, and most of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kansas</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Louisiana</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oklahoma</ENAMEX>.
As usual, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Orleans</ENAMEX> was among the last to learn this, thanks to the secrecy of diplomatic negotiations and the slow communications of the age. In the event, within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one month</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> different flags flew over the Place dâ€™Armes (now <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jackson Square</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Stars and Stripes</ENAMEX> replaced the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> flag on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20 December 1803</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">only three weeks</TIMEX> after the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> gave way to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>. Once again, the stunned <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> felt abandoned and betrayed.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yanks</ENAMEX> Are Coming!
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeffersonâ</ENAMEX>€™s choice of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Territory of Orleans</ENAMEX> seemed, to say the least, inauspicious. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Charles Cole Claiborne</ENAMEX> was a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Protestant</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX> who needed interpreters to communicate in both <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish</ENAMEX>. He judged the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Creoles</ENAMEX> honest but lazy and illeducated, their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> ugly and filthyÂ â€”Â though his horror at the cityâ€™s sanitation was understandable; he would lose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wives</ENAMEX> to yellow fever in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Orleans</ENAMEX>. In return, the local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Creoles</ENAMEX> considered themselves â€œmore worldlyâ€ than the rustic <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Claiborne</ENAMEX> persevered, however, learned <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>, changed the laws, and brought his carping <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">constituents</ENAMEX> into the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> fold as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> of the new <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">State of Louisiana</ENAMEX>, even though it was very much unlike any other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>.
War on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mississippi</ENAMEX>
Less than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two months</TIMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Louisiana</ENAMEX> won its statehood, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> went to war with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BritainÂ â€”Â</ENAMEX> for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> and last time. To everyoneâ€™s surprise, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Orleans</ENAMEX> became the stage for the most glorious, indeed the only, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX> victory of the whole conflict.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">War of 1812</ENAMEX> was fostered by accumulated <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> grievances. There were dramatic naval battles and a final ghastly defeat for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> when the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> burned down the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>. Finally, the warring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> focused on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Orleans</ENAMEX>. A <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> flotilla, diverted from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX>, sailed up the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mississippi</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 10,000</NUMEX> first-class <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> rushed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Major General</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrew Jackson</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Orleans</ENAMEX> to command the cityâ€™s defense. Out-manned and outgunned, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackson</ENAMEX> mobilized a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> of somewhat irregular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>: an unlikely <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">coalition</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">militiamen</ENAMEX>, local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Creoles</ENAMEX>, free <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Choctaws</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">associates</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">privateers</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jean</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierre Lafitte</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">74</NUMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pirates</ENAMEX> may well have been the key to the outcome, for they alone knew the ins and outs of the bayou <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, from where the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> attack would come.
In the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Battle of OrleansÂ â€”Â fought in Chalmette</ENAMEX> down the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">riverÂ â€”Â General</ENAMEX> Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward Packenham</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">redcoats</ENAMEX> marched in proper formation across the battlefield like toy <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">soldiersÂ â€”Â straight</ENAMEX> into the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">artillery</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">less than half an hour</TIMEX> it was all over: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Packenham</ENAMEX>, the brother-in-law of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Duke</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wellington</ENAMEX> (famous for his war successes), had been shot, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> had been killed, and the tattered <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">survivors</ENAMEX> withdrew in disarray. Ironically, the war was already over. A peace treaty had been signed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Belgium</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks</TIMEX> before, but news traveled no faster than a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ship</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">those days</TIMEX>.
Between Wars
By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1830s</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Orleans</ENAMEX> had reached its heyday. The sound of post-war prosperity was the blast of steam whistles on the river. With the development of powerful steamboats, navigation on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mississippi</ENAMEX> became a practical, economical matter. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Freighters</ENAMEX> moved <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">cotton</ENAMEX>, tobacco, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sugar</ENAMEX> downriver and worldwide. Passenger <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX> like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Natchez</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Belle</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Memphis</ENAMEX> were <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palaces</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX>, drink, music, and romance, at a time when even short journeys could take <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many days</TIMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Thousands</NUMEX> of steamboats docked along the quays <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every year</TIMEX>. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1840</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Orleans</ENAMEX> was the worldâ€™s largest cotton <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX>, second only to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> as a general port, and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> biggest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100,000</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>, who came south looking for a place to settle, found themselves unwelcome in the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">French Quarter</ENAMEX>. Instead they created a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> city <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">upriverÂ</ENAMEX> â€”Â now the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Garden DistrictÂ â</ENAMEX>€” using the plentiful land that once constituted sugar <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plantations</ENAMEX>.
It was also the era of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">benefactors</ENAMEX> both in social and cultural fields. One was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John McDonogh</ENAMEX>, who elevated conditions for the ordinary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. A plantation <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owner</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Scottish</ENAMEX> extraction, he educated and freed many slaves. Most of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">City Park</ENAMEX> is land he willed to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Orleans</ENAMEX>. When he died, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">millionaire</ENAMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1850</TIMEX> (back when <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a million dollars</NUMEX> really meant something), he left his money to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> to build <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> for the poor. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Dozens</NUMEX> are still named after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McDonogh</ENAMEX>, who, in effect, founded the cityâ€™s public school system.
At this time <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than half</NUMEX> of the black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> were slaves, and those that were led a less onerous life than in most other parts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South</ENAMEX>. â€œFree <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of colorâ€ ran their own <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX> and owned property. Free <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> of color were included among the concubines of white aristocrats, their lives organized according to arcane social codes.
Culture thrived in this climate. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carnival</ENAMEX> parades began in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1837</TIMEX>, although other aspects of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mardi Gras</ENAMEX> festivities had taken hold much earlier. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">French Opera House</ENAMEX>, at the corner of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bourbon</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toulouse</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>, opened in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1859</TIMEX> and supported the nationâ€™s <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">resident</ENAMEX> opera <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>. On quite another cultural <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX>, a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1798</TIMEX> law against gambling was ignored in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Orleans</ENAMEX>, where the card game of <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">poker</ENAMEX> is said to have originated. The merchant <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">seaman</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plantation</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">businessmen</ENAMEX> who thronged the city <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> also looked for the distraction of other pleasures, and prostitution was rife in the less salubrious parts of town.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">War</ENAMEX> between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">States</ENAMEX>
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 1861</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Louisiana</ENAMEX> joined other <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">cotton</ENAMEX> states in seceding from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lincolnâ€™s Union</ENAMEX>. After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two months</TIMEX> as an independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>, the state entered the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Confederacy</ENAMEX>, but because of its strategic significance, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Orleans</ENAMEX> became a high-priority target for the northern military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX>.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 1862</TIMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Union</ENAMEX> naval force led by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David G. Farragut</ENAMEX> capitalized on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Confederate</ENAMEX> unpreparedness and penetrated the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">defenses</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Orleans</ENAMEX>. Despite localized opposition, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">within a week</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Union</ENAMEX> flag was raised over the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. It announced a military occupation destined to endure beyond the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Civil War</ENAMEX> (or <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">War</ENAMEX> between the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">States</ENAMEX>, as it is known in the south) into the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Reconstruction periodÂ</ENAMEX> â€”Â for a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> bitter <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>. The reconstruction of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Orleans</ENAMEX> began in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1879</TIMEX>, when the jetties were built to speed the flow of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mississippi</ENAMEX> near its mouth. This improved navigation and returned the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port</ENAMEX> to a position of strength. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New</ENAMEX> railway lines linked the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> with the rest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1884</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> attempted to demonstrate its post-war recovery by staging an international fairÂ<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE"> â€”Â the Worldâ</ENAMEX>€™s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Industrial and Cotton Centennial ExpositionÂ</ENAMEX> â€”Â on the site of what is now <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Audubon Park</ENAMEX>. The morale-boosting exercise lost money, but the rest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> had started to hear about the industrious but amusing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mississippi</ENAMEX> as a place worth visiting.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Storyville Story</ENAMEX>
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1897</TIMEX>, in an attempt to curb the worst excesses of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Big Easy, Alderman Sidney Story</ENAMEX> created a city ordinance outlawing prostitution everywhere in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> except for a small, specific area just beyond the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">French Quarter</ENAMEX>, where it could be contained and controlled. This area, known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Storyville</ENAMEX>, became a legend in its own time, where the mixture of glamour, depravity, and color in the local brothels attracted almost every visiting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">celebrity</ENAMEX>, and where saloon drinkers, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gamblers</ENAMEX>, and rakes waiting their turn could tap their feet to a developing style of musicÂ â€” jazz. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis Armstrong</ENAMEX> started playing his bent, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nickel</ENAMEX>-plated cornet in the dives of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Storyville</ENAMEX>. He improvised from <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</TIMEX> to daybreak for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">15 cents</NUMEX> a night.
Storyville lasted exactly <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20 years</TIMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War I</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US Navy Department</ENAMEX> ordered the creation of a vice-free zone for <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">five miles</NUMEX> around every naval <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base</ENAMEX>. That included <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Storyville</ENAMEX>, and the place closed down.
The Long Saga
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Louisiana</ENAMEX>, politics and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> have always been a fascinating businessÂ â€”Â and business is the wordÂ â€”Â but none of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bosses</ENAMEX> could compare with larger-than-life <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Huey P. Long</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1893â€“1935</ENAMEX>). Long was cagey, ambitious, poor, and so bright he graduated from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tulane Law School</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">less than a year</TIMEX> after he entered. At the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age of 25</TIMEX> he was elected to the state public service <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">commission</ENAMEX>; as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX> he built <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridges</ENAMEX> that were desperately needed, and supplied all the stateâ€™s school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> with free textbooks. His slogans were <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">â€œEvery Man a Kingâ€ and â€œA Chicken in Every Pot</ENAMEX>.â€
Elected to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US Senate</ENAMEX>, he still controlled <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Louisiana</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>, having installed a puppet in the governorâ€™s office. Long was starting to attract a national following when he was assassinated in the state <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">capitol</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baton Rouge</ENAMEX> on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 1935</TIMEX>.
During the latter years of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Longâ€™s</ENAMEX> reign, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">French Quarter</ENAMEX> had reached a nadir, with many fine <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> in a state of near <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">collapseÂ â€”Â some</ENAMEX> were even demolished to make parking <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lots</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1936</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> set up the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vieux CarrÃ© Commission</ENAMEX> with powers to protect <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> of architectural value. It still operates to control development in the area.
Meanwhile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> had been discovered in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Louisiana</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1901</TIMEX>. The land was transformed by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wells</ENAMEX> sunk to extract the precious liquid. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1947</TIMEX> the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> offshore <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rig</ENAMEX> was opened and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mississippi valley</ENAMEX> became a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">hub</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> and gas production and storage. After the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War</ENAMEX> new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">highways</ENAMEX> led to broader horizons, and suburbs began to sprawl. Following the construction of the impressive causeway across <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lake Pontchartrain</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1956</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commuters</ENAMEX> even began to move to the far side of the lake, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX> assembled <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">technicians</ENAMEX> at suburban <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Michoud</ENAMEX> to produce its booster <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">rockets</ENAMEX>.
Desegregation in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>, which hit many southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> hard in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s</TIMEX>, passed off in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Orleans</ENAMEX> with a minimum of trouble. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Whites</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> had always mixed more freely here than in most places in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Dixie</ENAMEX>, and the drive for racial equality reached an historic high in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1977</TIMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ernest â€œDutchâ€ Morial</ENAMEX> was elected the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African-American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mayor</ENAMEX>.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> â€œDutchâ€™sâ€ <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marc</ENAMEX> carries on the family tradition as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mayor</ENAMEX>. But if the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> seems to be moving in a positive direction, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> has other problems. As <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the third millennium</TIMEX> begins, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Louisiana</ENAMEX> is again suffering the problem that has plagued it throughout its history. Federal racketeering charges have been brought against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edwin EdwardsÂ</ENAMEX> â€”Â  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Louisiana State</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Governor</ENAMEX> until his retirement in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1996Â â</NUMEX>€”Â  and the huge trial in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baton Rouge</ENAMEX> is keeping the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> on the edge of its seat. It seems that little has changed since the times of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">John Law</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Orleans</ENAMEX> seems to move from strength to strength. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX> new cultural and recreational <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> have multiplied the cityâ€™s tourist potential. These include greatly expanded riverfront <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX>, a state-of-the-art <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">aquarium</ENAMEX>, and a revived warehouse district.
