<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> and its people
Thereâ€™s no other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> on earth like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX>. It is a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of superlatives, having more <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canals</ENAMEX> than <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venice</ENAMEX> and more <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridges</ENAMEX> than <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX>. It is also one of the prettiest in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 50</NUMEX> museumsÂ â€”Â featuring everything from the worlds most prominent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX>, to the history of hempÂ â€”Â quench the thirst for even the most ardent culture buff, and with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16th</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17th</TIMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th centuries</TIMEX>, the reflections of its illustrious history happily ripple on into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 21st century</TIMEX>. However, the lure of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amsterdamâ</ENAMEX>€™s bricks and mortar is only part of its excitement. Its contemporary culture is vibrantÂ<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL"> â€”Â itâ€™s</ENAMEX> definitely not a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> stuck in the past, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are open-minded, easygoing, and opinionated but also down to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">earth</ENAMEX> and welcoming to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> is situated in the north of The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Netherlands</ENAMEX> and was set where the outlet of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Amstel River</ENAMEX> meets the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salty tidal waters</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zuider Zee</ENAMEX>. With little dry land to build on, exactly why a small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">settlers</ENAMEX> chose this unpromising spot is difficult to understand. Yet it proved to be an excellent decision because <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amsterdammers</ENAMEX> (as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">natives</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> are called) soon came to control the waters of the river, and the trade which flowed along it. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th century</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> had become arguably the richest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> in the world, at the center of a huge <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> colonial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX>. It traded in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spices</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rum</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sugar cane</ENAMEX> among other commodities, and its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> demanded only the best. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> of this periodÂ â€”Â called the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golden AgeÂ</ENAMEX> â€”Â forms the heart of todayâ€™s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>.
Without doubt, the initial lure of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> is its numerous historic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>. The lines of tall, narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> with their pretty gables rest beside picture-perfect tree-lined <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canals</ENAMEX>. They are connected by ornate iron <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridges</ENAMEX> and cobbled walkways, which have changed little for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">over 300 years</TIMEX>, in fact, since they felt the footfall of such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhabitants</ENAMEX> as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rembrandt</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">explorer Abel Tasman</ENAMEX>, who gave his name to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tasmania</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> is a wonderful <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>. Small enough to stroll around, and with the canal side <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> too narrow for tour <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">buses</ENAMEX>, you canâ€™t drive past all the best attractions at high speed. Here, there is no glass window between you and reality. You have to feel the summer sun, or see your breath on a crisp <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> as you step out to see what <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> is all about. If you take a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canal</ENAMEX> tour, the quiet <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> allow you to float slowly along, away from the noise of the modern world.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX> could keep you busy for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX>. Art collections, historic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>, and memorials to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heroes</ENAMEX> and heroines can all be found here. For entertainment after the sun sets, there are over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> different performances in the city every <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Netherlands National Opera and National Ballet</ENAMEX> are based here, and there are numerous orchestral, musical, and comedy venues, along with revues and dance shows. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> also plays host to one of the most dynamic club scenes in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, with several major venues drawing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>.
Yet if the faÃ§ades of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> hark back to the past, the interiors do not. Internet banking, interactive information points, and resource recycling advice centersÂ â€”Â the concepts of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> are alive and thriving all around the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. This is no historic ghost <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> brims with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. Its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> are still lived in (although most are now <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartments</ENAMEX> rather than single-family <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX>), and its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> filled with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bakeries</ENAMEX>, delicatessens, and wine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">merchants</ENAMEX> where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> drop in to buy dinner on the way <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> in the evenings. Itâ€™s all part of the fascinating dichotomy you find at every turn here. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> strides into the future while still holding hands with the past.
The historic heart of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> has remained unchanged mainly because of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> power. As in most <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> in the world, during the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> part of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 20th century</TIMEX> property <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">developers</ENAMEX> eyed the old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canal houses</ENAMEX> with relish. The price of land was soaring, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">developers</ENAMEX> could make a tidy profit by demolishing them and replacing them with something modern. Unfashionable <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>, such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">warehouses</ENAMEX> of the old docks, were simply left to the elements, deemed to be worthless. Amsterdammers, though, had other ideas. They went out onto the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> to fight for their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, barricading historic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> and occupying empty <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">warehouse</ENAMEX> district.
This was typical of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populace</ENAMEX>, and it wasnâ€™t the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time; in fact <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amsterdammers</ENAMEX> have been standing up for what they believe in for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX>. When <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Protestants</ENAMEX> were persecuted in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16th century</TIMEX>, they flocked here from all around <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> to take refuge. During <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WWII</ENAMEX>, the dock <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> went on strike as an act of protest against the treatment of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. Although in the end the protest was futile, it shows the strength of feeling and social awareness that pervades every part of society here. As <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 21st century</TIMEX> begins, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 100</NUMEX> different nationalities living within the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> boundaries, a situation which could be fraught with difficulty and strain. Yet here it only adds to the cultural richness built up over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX> of exploration and trade.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amsterdammers</ENAMEX> seem to have the ability to find creative solutions to the problems of their world. When there wasnâ€™t enough housing on the land, they looked at the empty <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canals</ENAMEX> and decided that houseboats would help. There are now <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 2,500</NUMEX> on the waterways of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> became a problem in the old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> they gave the bicycle priority, and now there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 1,000,000</NUMEX> on the streetsÂ â€”Â and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an estimated 30,000</NUMEX> at the bottom of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canal system</ENAMEX> at any one time! <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Youâ€™ll</ENAMEX> quickly learn to listen for the warning bells and stand clear as their riders pedal by.
Perhaps the most widely publicized acts of tolerance in recent history have been in the areas of sex and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Amsterdammers</ENAMEX> looked at feasible and practical responses to the issues, and decriminalized some aspects of both. This does not make the city <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> huge den of iniquity and these areas are still controlled and regulated; in fact, you could visit <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> and be quite unaware of these activities. Thereâ€™s just a recognition here that provided no harm comes to you or others around you, then you should be free, as an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult</ENAMEX>, to make your own choices.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amsterdammers</ENAMEX> fight for everyoneâ€™s rights against oppression, or the right of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David</ENAMEX> to stand against the faceless <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goliath</ENAMEX> of bureaucracy. In fact in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several thousand</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Davids</ENAMEX> get together to form a pressure <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goliath</ENAMEX> has to sit up and take notice. This doesnâ€™t mean that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> is utopiaÂ â€”Â it is a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21st-century</TIMEX> pressures, particularly with continuing problems of traffic and litterÂ â€”Â but it does mean that the problems are faced realistically, debated passionately by the whole <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX>, and agreed solutions are put into action. When the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solutions donâ</ENAMEX>€™t work (as they often donâ€™t) the whole process starts over again. It is all seen as part of a huge learning curve.
Of course, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amsterdammers</ENAMEX> donâ€™t spend all their time waving protest banners. They are as industrious and hardworking as their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forefathers</ENAMEX>. They enjoy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">galleries</ENAMEX> and exhibitions as much as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">visitors doÂ â€”Â</ENAMEX> in fact it can be very hard to get tickets for performances because of local demand. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekends</TIMEX> they head to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX> to picnic, or out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> in large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> to do more cycling. They eat out in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cafÃ©sÂ â€”Â where</ENAMEX> they have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 50</NUMEX> different types of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cuisine</ENAMEX> to choose from. They love to socialize, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">barsÂ â€”Â particularly the famous â€œbrown barsâ€Â â€”Â</ENAMEX> are the place where they meet, usually to put the world to rights. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> they sit out with a drink as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> put out tables in the squares and on street <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">corners</ENAMEX>. Sit at a table and youâ€™ll soon find yourself engaged in conversation (most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amsterdammers</ENAMEX> speak good <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>). Within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an hour</TIMEX> youâ€™ll feel like a local.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> has many facets, almost as many as the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diamonds</ENAMEX> for which the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> is famous. Yet these seem to amalgamate into a coherent whole. It is a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of history, which shouts from every gable and street <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">corner</ENAMEX>; a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of cultureÂ â€”Â of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">musicians</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX>; a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of learning with a large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">university</ENAMEX>; a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of trade with banking at its core; a multi-ethnic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 100</NUMEX> different nationalities; a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of â€œlive and let liveâ€ as minority <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> are able to flourish and innovative ideas to develop; and of course, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of tourism, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 32 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> per year. The beauty of its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> is undisputed, but it is the sum of all these parts that makes <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> an unforgettable <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> to visit.
