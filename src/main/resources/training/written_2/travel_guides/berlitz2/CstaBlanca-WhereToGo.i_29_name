Where to Go
With such a long stretch of coast to cover and so many historic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> to visit inland, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Costa Blanca</ENAMEX> may seem difficult to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">navigate¬†‚Äî¬†particularly</ENAMEX> if you don‚Äôt have a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>. But the itineraries in the following pages take in all the tourist-worthy sights in this sprawling region, and every one of these important places of interest can easily be reached by public transport.
Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> will be staying within easy reach of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alicante</ENAMEX>, so our trips start out from here. At the centre of the region‚Äôs road <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alicante</ENAMEX> is also a logical base for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">motorists</ENAMEX> and for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX> and bus <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">connections</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Tourists</ENAMEX> who fly into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alicante‚Äôs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX> on package holidays usually begin their sightseeing with a visit to the provincial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX>.
From <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alicante</ENAMEX> we head north along the coast to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gandia</ENAMEX> and south to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cartagena</ENAMEX>. We then make for the historic inland <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Elche, Orihuela</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murcia</ENAMEX>, equally within easy reach.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Benidorm</ENAMEX> is the main destination for many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX>, and this popular <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> provides another good point of departure for excursions to nearby islands like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Isla de Benidorm</ENAMEX>, as well as to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">moody villages</ENAMEX>, like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guadalest</ENAMEX>, in the interior.
The southernmost stretch of coast south of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cartagena</ENAMEX> is not readily accessible by bus or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX>. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">motorists</ENAMEX> as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adventurers</ENAMEX> willing to brave infrequent, capricious transport <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">services</ENAMEX> will enjoy discovering the few remaining pockets of unspoiled, arid beauty and remote whitewashed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX>. Most of this coast, though, is filling with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX>, villas, and apartment <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">blocks</ENAMEX>.
Alicante
<ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">Swaying palms</ENAMEX> and luminous skies, along with some of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spain‚</ENAMEX>Äôs best <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tapas bars</ENAMEX>, lure <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> to the provincial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alicante</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> is as popular with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vacationers</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> as it was with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> colonizers in ancient times.
You‚Äôll always see cosmopolitan <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowds</ENAMEX> here, especially on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Explanada de Espa√±a</ENAMEX>, the splendid waterfront <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">promenade</ENAMEX> that stretches alongside the harbour, and on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paseo Maritimo</ENAMEX>. You can stroll to the music of the municipal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sundays</TIMEX> or try one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paseo</ENAMEX>. Just east of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Explanada</ENAMEX>, an irresistible stretch of sandy beach, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Playa del Postiguet</ENAMEX>, beckons.
The broad <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rambla de M√©ndez N√∫√±ez</ENAMEX>, running at a right angle to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Explanada</ENAMEX>, is good for a morning‚Äôs shopping and has a lively market at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one end</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">It‚Äôs</ENAMEX> also the route taken by patriotic, civic, and religious processions, most notably the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hogueras de San Juan</ENAMEX> parade held <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every June</TIMEX>. Off the rambla (the name given to a broad, tree-lined <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">avenue</ENAMEX>) to the right is the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Calle</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mayor</ENAMEX>, a pedestrian <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>. Here, street <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendors</ENAMEX> hawk pens, watches, and jewellery, and on religious <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">holidays</TIMEX> processions pass by on their way from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Catedral de San Nicol√°s de Bari</ENAMEX>. Situated a stone‚Äôs throw from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Calle</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mayor</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avenida General Sanjurjo</ENAMEX> in the old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">cathedral</ENAMEX> was considerably restored after <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the Civil War</ENAMEX>. Note the impressive nave and fa√ßade, excellent examples of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Juan de Herrera‚</ENAMEX>Äôs austere style, recalling the magnificent <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Escorial Palace</ENAMEX> near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX>, which he also designed.
Walk beyond the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Calle</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mayor</ENAMEX> and the tranquil <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Plaza de Santa Faz</ENAMEX> to get to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plaza del Ayuntamiento</ENAMEX>, where a coin and stamp market is held on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sundays</TIMEX> and public <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">holidays</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> is the site of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ayuntamiento</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Town Hall</ENAMEX>), with a beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baroque</ENAMEX> fa√ßade designed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 18th century</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lorenzo Ch√°puli</ENAMEX>, a local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX>. A highly polished <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brass</ENAMEX> stud on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step of the main staircase registers a height exactly <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> metres (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 feet</NUMEX>) above sea level. This is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spain‚Äôs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> altitude-measuring point. The handsome, red-lettered marble plaque on the same staircase is a copy of the city‚Äôs charter, presented by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferdinand II</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aragon</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1490</TIMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ayuntamiento</ENAMEX> houses a small picture <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">gallery</ENAMEX> and a chapel with tiles from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manises</ENAMEX>, an important <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Valencian</ENAMEX> ceramics centre. Look for the painting of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patron saint</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alicante, Saint</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nicholas</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bari</ENAMEX>, over the altar. There are <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th-century</TIMEX> royal portraits in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sal√≥n Azul</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blue Room</ENAMEX>) and archives that preserve the document of privileges granted to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alfonso X</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wise</ENAMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 13th century</TIMEX>.
A short distance uphill brings you to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Baroque west</ENAMEX> front of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iglesia de Santa Mar√≠a</ENAMEX> (between the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Calle</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mayor</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Calle Jorge Juan</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> dates from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 14th century</TIMEX>. This is one of many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX> built during the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Christianization</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">territory</ENAMEX> won from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moors</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">James I</ENAMEX> in legendary <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13th-century</TIMEX> battles; it stands on the site where a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX> originally stood. Works by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Braque, Chagall, Giacometti</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Picasso</ENAMEX>, and many other <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> hang next door in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museo de Arte del Siglo XX</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20th-Century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Art</ENAMEX>).
Beyond you‚Äôll find the tiny <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barrio de Santa Cruz</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">This quarter</TIMEX> is all that remains of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Villa Vieja</ENAMEX>, or old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>. You can still see fascinating glimpses of traditional narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> are decorated with potted <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> and wrought-iron grilles.
From this barrio you‚Äôll be able to see the most prominent sight in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alicante</ENAMEX>, the historic <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Castillo de</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa B√°rbara</ENAMEX>, perched <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">115</NUMEX> metres (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">350 feet</NUMEX>) above the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mount Benacantil</ENAMEX>. The site has been fortified since prehistoric times and offers beautiful views of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aitana</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Juan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Pola</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Benidorm</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tabarca</ENAMEX> islands in the distance. To get to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX>, drive up the winding road to the summit or use the lift at the far end of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Calle Juan Bautista Lafora</ENAMEX>, close to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Postiguet</ENAMEX> beach. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santa B√°rbara</ENAMEX>, built by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carthaginians</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the third century</TIMEX> b.c., was so well fortified that for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nearly 2,000 years</TIMEX> nobody conquered it. Only when the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> succeeded in blowing up part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garrison</ENAMEX>, during the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">War of the Spanish Succession</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1707</TIMEX>, was the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> taken.
On the opposite side of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Barrio San Blas</ENAMEX> is the smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Castillo de San Fernando</ENAMEX>, begun during the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">War</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Independence</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1808‚Äì1814</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX>, set above the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> of the small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parque Municipal</ENAMEX>, provides a favourite spot for viewing <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Santa B√°rbara</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the late afternoon</TIMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museo Arqueol√≥gico Provincial</ENAMEX>, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diputaci√≥n</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chamber of Deputies</ENAMEX>) in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avenida General Mola</ENAMEX>, contains an interesting ceramics collection, with some pieces dating back to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greeks</ENAMEX>. Be sure to take a look at the graceful pottery of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iberians</ENAMEX>, adorned with simple painted lines. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">You‚Äôll</ENAMEX> also be able to admire the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stone Age</ENAMEX> pottery and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone bracelets</ENAMEX>, as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carthaginian</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">carvings</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moorish</ENAMEX> relics.
Outskirts of Alicante
Outside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, on the main <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Valencia</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">highway</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monasterio de Santa Ver√≥nica</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint Veronica‚Äôs Monastery</ENAMEX>) attracts <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 15,000</NUMEX> pilgrims and a good many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hawkers</ENAMEX> during the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual May</TIMEX> celebration of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Faz</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holy Face</ENAMEX>). Armed with canes decorated with bunches of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rosemary</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> proceed on foot to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monastery</ENAMEX>, where they venerate the Holy Face cloth that, according to tradition, retained the bloodstained image of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Jesus‚Äô</ENAMEX> face after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint Veronica</ENAMEX> used it to wipe his brow as he went to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calvary</ENAMEX>.
The sacred relic was first worshipped in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alicante region</ENAMEX> during a drought in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1489</TIMEX>. As it was being carried across the site of the present-day <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monastery</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santa Faz</ENAMEX> is said to have suddenly become too heavy to hold, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">believers</ENAMEX> claim that a tear fell from the right eye of the image. This was interpreted as a sign to construct the building which has housed the cloth ever since. It can be seen at the high altar or in a chapel off the sacristy.
There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> other Holy <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Face handkerchiefs¬†‚Äî¬†one in Ja√©n</ENAMEX> and the other in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Vatican</ENAMEX>. According to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roman Catholic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX>, the original cloth was divided into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>.
The small, flat island of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nueva Tabarca</ENAMEX> lies about an hour by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alicante</ENAMEX>. (From <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-April</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> run <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alicante</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Pola</ENAMEX>, whence the sea voyage takes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> as long. There is no service in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the winter</TIMEX>.) You won‚Äôt see any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pirates</ENAMEX> here, as the last of them sailed away from their former stronghold in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1786</TIMEX>. But you will find <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fishermen</ENAMEX>, many of whom are direct <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">descendants</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 600</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Genoese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mercenaries King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles III</ENAMEX> rescued from captivity on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Tunisia‚Äôs Tabarka Island</ENAMEX>, hence the name. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have made <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nueva Tabarca</ENAMEX> their home for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than two centuries</TIMEX>, in spite of poor fishing and the lack of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priest</ENAMEX>, and schoolmaster. It was tourism that finally saved the declining <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> from fading away altogether, and provided <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">islanders</ENAMEX> with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priest</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> at last. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sun</ENAMEX>-seeking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>, mostly <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Spaniards</ENAMEX>, flock to the island on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sundays</TIMEX>, the most popular day for excursions. Even then, you‚Äôll always be able to find peace and quiet on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the tiny, seaweed-draped coves beyond the main sandy bay.
Inland from Alicante
For a change of scenery, drive north of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alicante</ENAMEX> into the rocky, lunar-like landscape of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cabe√</ENAMEX>ßo d‚ÄôOr mountains. This is where you‚Äôll find the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cuevas de Canalobre</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Candelabrum Cave</ENAMEX>), which is reached by following the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-340 from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Juan de Alicante</ENAMEX> until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the turn</TIMEX>-off for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Busot</ENAMEX>, where signs mark the way to the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">cave</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Floodlights</ENAMEX> dramatize the eerie ranks of gigantic stalagmites and stalactites, which crowd <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chambers</ENAMEX> up to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">115 metres</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">350 feet</NUMEX>) high. The acoustics are so exceptional that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> concerts are held in the caves.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jijona</ENAMEX> also lies within easy reach of the provincial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX>. This <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, just <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">27 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">14 miles</NUMEX>) from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alicante</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-340</ENAMEX>, is renowned for the manufacture of turr√≥n, an exotic sweet of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moorish</ENAMEX> origin, made from ground almonds, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">orange-blossom honey</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">egg</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">white</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sugar</ENAMEX>. Traditionally served by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas time</TIMEX>, the flat bars of turr√≥n are very hard. A softer, sweeter version called torta de turr√≥n is oval and made with extra <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">honey</ENAMEX> and whole almonds. You can learn all about this popular confection on a tour of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">El Lobo factory</ENAMEX>, founded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1725</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">There‚Äôs</ENAMEX> even a small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> on the premises.
From <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jijona</ENAMEX>, continue along the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">340</NUMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alcoy</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">56 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">36 miles</NUMEX>) from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alicante</ENAMEX>. Don‚Äôt be disappointed by this grey industrial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, for it manufactures some of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spain‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most popular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sweets</ENAMEX>: they are peladillas, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marcona</ENAMEX> almonds coated with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sugar</ENAMEX>. Sometimes pine kernels are sugar-coated, too, and the delicious result is called pinyonets.
Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alcoy</ENAMEX> has a reputation for dourness and occasional <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">snow</ENAMEX>, the townspeople are usually very friendly. At the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> celebration of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moors</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christians</ENAMEX> fiesta, for example, you‚Äôll be astonished by the colourful costumes and lively faces. If <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">you‚Äôre</ENAMEX> here out of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX>, the costumes, worn <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year after year</TIMEX>, will be on display in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 18th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Casal de San Jordi</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Museo Camilo Visedo</ENAMEX> nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> a fascinating collection of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iberian</ENAMEX> clay sculpture taken from a settlement in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sierra Serreta</ENAMEX>. To visit the site, just a few kilometres (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a couple of miles</NUMEX>) from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, take the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-3313</ENAMEX> road, but prepare yourself for a hard <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30-minute</TIMEX> scramble up the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Serreta</ENAMEX>.
From the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ibi</ENAMEX> onwards you‚Äôll see many castles and forts, some of them visible for <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">miles</NUMEX>. They were strategically positioned by ever-vigilant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Romans, Moors</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christians</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Castalla</ENAMEX>, just off the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Ibi-Villena</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>, is one of the most dramatically located in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>. It was built by the counts of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Castalla</ENAMEX>, but left incomplete. Farther along the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Villena</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> is the round <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Biar</ENAMEX>, of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moorish</ENAMEX> origin and still in reasonable condition. It was declared a national monument and is interesting both outside and in, especially the vaulted ceiling on the upper floor.
Continue <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">now</TIMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Villena</ENAMEX>, the farthest point from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alicante</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">64 km/39 miles</NUMEX> away) on this tour. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> here, noted for its double walls and high, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX>-turreted <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> rarely found south of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX>, also has national monument status. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Villena‚Äôs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> was originally built by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moors</ENAMEX>, though considerable additions were made in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 15th century</TIMEX>. The town‚Äôs priceless <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bronze Age treasure</ENAMEX>, discovered in a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">clay jar</ENAMEX> in the riverbed, is exhibited in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ayuntamiento</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Town Hall</ENAMEX>). The gold jewellery and objects attest to the artistry of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Villena‚</ENAMEX>Äôs early <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhabitants</ENAMEX>.
Swing south from Villena along the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">330</NUMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sax</ENAMEX>, site of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saxum</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">towers</ENAMEX> of the original <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX>, which has been fully restored, are still a look-out point. Back on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-330 you soon come to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Petrel‚Äôs Moorish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX>, reputed to have fabulous treasure buried in its grounds.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Unrestored medieval fortresses</ENAMEX> are found along the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-3212</ENAMEX> road to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elda</ENAMEX>, and beyond, at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mon√≥var</ENAMEX>. Elda itself is noted for excellent wine and lace-making. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> was the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">birthplace</ENAMEX> of the famous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jos√© Mart√≠nez Ruiz</ENAMEX>, better known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Azor√≠n.</ENAMEX> From <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Elda</ENAMEX>, follow the signs to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Novelda</ENAMEX> to find yet another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moorish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> set high on a hill. This one is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Castillo de la Mola</ENAMEX>, erected on the site of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roman fort</ENAMEX>. It has an unusual triangular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> dating from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 13th century</TIMEX>. Right next to it you‚Äôll see a strange structure reminiscent of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gaud√≠‚Äôs</ENAMEX> still unfinished <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Templo de la Sagrada Familia</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barcelona.</ENAMEX>
If, after all this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX>-viewing, you still haven‚Äôt had enough, a few kilometres (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a couple of miles</NUMEX>) farther on in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Aspe</ENAMEX>, you‚Äôll find las ruinas (the ruins). Local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> will direct you to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX>, which they never call by that name. Look out for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moorish</ENAMEX> relics, which are still sometimes discovered here. Then <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> back to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alicante</ENAMEX>, just <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">28 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">17 miles</NUMEX>) away.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North Coast</ENAMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Costa Blanca‚</ENAMEX>Äôs reputation for magnificent beaches and lively resorts comes from the northern stretch of coast. Take the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-332 from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alicante</ENAMEX> and drive through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campello</ENAMEX> to the fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Villajoyosa</ENAMEX>. This picturesque village, some <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">30 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">18 miles</NUMEX>) from the provincial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX>, is more authentically <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Benidorm</ENAMEX>, its cosmopolitan neighbour. 
Wind your way towards the sea through the narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> of the old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, and suddenly you‚Äôll see a group of housefronts in sun-bleached blues, pinks, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">yellows</ENAMEX>. White-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">rimmed</NUMEX> doors and windows, black wrought-iron grilles, green blinds, and a massive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gothic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> give the impression of a sparkling diadem¬†‚Äî¬†but then Villajoyosa literally means <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚ÄúJewelled Town</ENAMEX>.‚Äù
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">La Vila</ENAMEX>, as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Villajoyosa</ENAMEX> is affectionately called, boasts some <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moorish</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Visigothic</ENAMEX> remains, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spain‚</ENAMEX>Äôs oldest chocolate <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factories</ENAMEX>. But it‚Äôs the vivacious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moors</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christians</ENAMEX> fiesta, with its bare-bellied, flashing-eyed ‚Äúslave-girls‚Äù and swashbuckling ‚Äúcorsairs,‚Äù that really makes the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> unique. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last week of July</TIMEX>, many of the town‚Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhabitants</ENAMEX> parade and fight in richly costumed <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">companies¬†‚Äî¬†los piratas</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">los</ENAMEX> tuareg, and los moros <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">del Rif</ENAMEX> among them¬†‚Äî¬†re-enacting the defeat in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1538</TIMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Algerian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pirate Zala Arr√°ez</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scourge</ENAMEX> who started it all by sacking the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> in a daring dawn raid.
If you dress the part and stay on your feet for the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven days</TIMEX> the fiesta lasts, you can join the ranks of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Els Pollosos</ENAMEX>. This means <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚Äúthe Lousy Ones‚</ENAMEX>Äù in the valenciano dialect and refers to a ‚Äúmercenary‚Äù <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> open to all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">volunteers</ENAMEX>. As a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, you can take part in the famous <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Moorish</ENAMEX> attack, still faithfully acted out as it really happened <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">over 41‚ÅÑ2 centuries ago</TIMEX>. What with all the cannon-firing and colourful acting, the excitement can reach fever pitch.
Benidorm, one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spain‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most famous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX>, lies just <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">12 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">71‚ÅÑ2 miles</NUMEX>) north of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Villajoyosa</ENAMEX>. On the way, you‚Äôll pass the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Casino Costa Blanca</ENAMEX>, where the stakes are low and the excitement runs high. For an account of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Benidorm‚Äôs</ENAMEX> discovery by world tourism and a description of the town‚Äôs most interesting sights, see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43</NUMEX>.
Altea, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6 miles</NUMEX>) north of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Benidorm</ENAMEX>, was an important <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Phoenician</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moors</ENAMEX> called it <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Altaya</ENAMEX>, meaning <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚ÄúHealth for All</ENAMEX>,‚Äù but not before they had destroyed the first settlement and rebuilt the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Altea</ENAMEX> is one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spain‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most memorable and tranquil <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX>, and a careful development policy helps to keep it that way. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">You‚Äôll</ENAMEX> find small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bungalows</ENAMEX> here, rather than hotel <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">blocks</ENAMEX>, and a delightful seaside market held on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesdays</TIMEX>.
The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">257</NUMEX> steps that climb steeply above the main shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avenida Ferm√≠n Sanz Orrio</ENAMEX>, lead to the old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX>. Here the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> are almost always full of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, who congregate in local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Altea</ENAMEX> boasts a number of art <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">galleries</ENAMEX> and an artists‚Äô <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX> well-known in the region.
On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sundays</TIMEX> and fiestas, in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the afternoon</TIMEX>, traditional games of pelota are played in the narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Altea‚Äôs</ENAMEX> church <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Players</ENAMEX> strike the ball with their bare hands against walls, doors, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">windows¬†‚Äî¬†which</ENAMEX> are protected by grilles.
The best of the local beaches, most of which are pebbly, is south at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Albir</ENAMEX>, between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Altea</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sierra Helada</ENAMEX>.
Calpe‚Äôs popularity with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> is ensured by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> fine sandy beaches. This former fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">12 km/71‚ÅÑ2 miles</NUMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Altea</ENAMEX>) lies at the base of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pe√±√≥n de Ifach</ENAMEX>, a volcanic rock thrusting out of the sea to a height of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than 335 metres</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,000 feet</NUMEX>).
You don‚Äôt have to be a mountaineer to climb the rock; anyone fit can make it to the top of this coastal landmark. On the way up, you can admire the wildflowers, and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">autumn</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> you may catch sight of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Audouin‚Äôs Gull</ENAMEX> (a rare <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> with dark olive legs and a black-banded red bill). It‚Äôs a good idea to take a jersey (sweater)and something to drink.
If you have time, follow the coastal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calpe</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moraira</ENAMEX>, where flats and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">villas</ENAMEX> fill terraced hillsides high above rocky coves. Otherwise, take the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Alicante‚ÄìValencia road</ENAMEX>, which passes inland through rich, agricultural <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Gata de Gorgos¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> noted for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cane</ENAMEX>, basket-work, and even furniture¬†‚Äî¬†and rural <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">J√°vea</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J√°vea</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">27 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">16 miles</NUMEX>) from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Calpe</ENAMEX>, sprawls between pine-covered <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cape Nao</ENAMEX> to the south and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cape San Antonio</ENAMEX> to the north. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> is ideal for a quiet family holiday, especially in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">spring</TIMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J√</ENAMEX>°vea is magical with the scents of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lemon</ENAMEX> and orange blossoms. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Citrus fruit</ENAMEX> became the region‚Äôs principal cash <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crop</ENAMEX> around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the turn of the century</TIMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">grain</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">windmills</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cape San Antonio</ENAMEX> were abandoned. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">J√°vea</ENAMEX> has been proclaimed ‚Äúenvironmentally <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly perfect‚</NUMEX>Äù and you can bask in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Costa Blanca‚</ENAMEX>Äôs brightest sunshine here. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J√°vea</ENAMEX> also has an interesting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museo Hist√≥rico y Etnogr√</ENAMEX>°fico with an important collection of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iberian</ENAMEX> finds from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sierra de Montg√≥</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> strongly contrasting churches¬†‚Äî¬†an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 16th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">fortified building</ENAMEX>, and a modern, boat-shaped structure.
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Ten km</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6 miles</NUMEX>) from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">J√</ENAMEX>°vea is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Denia</ENAMEX>, with long sandy beaches, a lofty brooding <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">830</NUMEX> metres (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2,500 feet</NUMEX>) of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mount Montg√≥</ENAMEX> to climb. On a clear day you can see all the way to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ibiza</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">62 miles</NUMEX>) away. This <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> is another good centre for a family holiday. Once the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phoenicians</ENAMEX> unsuccessfully prospected for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">minerals</ENAMEX> here, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greeks</ENAMEX> established a port. Today‚Äôs growing industrial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, a centre of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wood</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plastics</ENAMEX>, and toy making, takes its name from a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diana</ENAMEX>, the remains of which are on view in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ayuntamiento</ENAMEX>. Just east of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Denia</ENAMEX>, you can visit the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cueva de Agua Dulce</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Freshwater Cave</ENAMEX>) with its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> lakes. A little farther away near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vergel</ENAMEX>, you can try the well-kept <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Safari Park</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> galore, a fine dolphin show, children‚Äôs amusement <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>, refreshments, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>.
At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gand√≠a</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">32 km/19 miles</NUMEX> north of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Denia</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-332</ENAMEX>), you‚Äôll be tempted to spend all your time on the town‚Äôs broad promenades and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">13 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">8 miles</NUMEX>) of splendid beaches. But it would be a pity to miss the quiet majesty of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Palacio de los Duques</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palace</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dukes of Gand√≠a</ENAMEX>), home of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint Francis Borja</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1510‚Äì1572</ENAMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Duke</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gand√≠a</ENAMEX>, who abandoned worldly pleasures to join the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jesuit</ENAMEX> order after the death of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX>, now a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jesuit</ENAMEX> college, is open to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">Guided tours</ENAMEX>, several times per day in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX>, visit <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartments</ENAMEX> with superbly tiled <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floors</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Duke‚Äôs private chapel</ENAMEX>.
Inland from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gand√</ENAMEX>≠a
From <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gand√≠a</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-320</ENAMEX>, then the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-322</ENAMEX>, lead inland through orange <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">groves</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">vineyards</ENAMEX>, and slowly rising <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">J√°tiva.</ENAMEX> This ‚Äúcity of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a thousand</NUMEX> fountains,‚Äù huge plane <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>, and a sprawling <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">fortress</ENAMEX> was probably founded by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hannibal</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">219 b.c. Europe‚</ENAMEX>Äôs first paper was made here in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 11th century</TIMEX>. Both the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painter</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jos√© de Ribera</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> infamous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">popes</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Calixtus III</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alexander VI</ENAMEX>, were born in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">J√°tiva.</ENAMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">popes</ENAMEX> were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Borja</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, better known to history as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Italy‚</ENAMEX>Äôs notorious <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Borgias</ENAMEX>.
Seek out <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">J√</ENAMEX>°tiva‚Äôs late-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance Colegiata</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Collegiate Church</ENAMEX>) in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Plaza de</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Calixto III</ENAMEX>. Just opposite is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ages old</TIMEX> but still in use. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">It‚Äôs</ENAMEX> noted for a splendid fa√ßade designed in the ornate <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Plateresque</ENAMEX> style. Find time, too, for the well-presented <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museo Municipal</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carrer de la Corretgeria</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX>. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX> round the corner, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 11th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Pila de los Moros</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Moorish Basin</ENAMEX>) was once used for traditional ablutions. The figures decorating the basin are rarely seen in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX> art, since Islam forbids human and animal representation.
Directly above the old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ermita de San Feli√∫</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Felix‚Äôs Hermitage</ENAMEX>) commands a wide view. Although it has been a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> bastion since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the third century</TIMEX>, it was a pagan sacrificial site long before that. Continue uphill to the fortress, which is, in fact, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> castles. Ramparts connect the smaller pre-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman Castillo Menor</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Small Castle</ENAMEX>) with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> and post-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman Castillo Mayor</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Main Castle</ENAMEX>), once notorious for its dungeon. Disgraced princes and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">noblemen</ENAMEX> were confined here, their only solace being the ruined <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">chapel</ENAMEX> adjacent. 
Leave <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">J√</ENAMEX>°tiva on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-340</ENAMEX> and drive up into the highlands where thick-fleeced <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sheep</ENAMEX> and isolated farmhouses complete a memorable vista. Pass through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Albaida</ENAMEX>, known for its candle-making, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Onteniente</ENAMEX>, an industrial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, to picturesque <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bocairente</ENAMEX>. Visit the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late summer</TIMEX> for the festival of folk dancing, or for <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">February‚Äôs Fiesta</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moors</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christians</ENAMEX>. The sombre bull-ring was hacked from solid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rock</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corrida</ENAMEX>.
For a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">barely 5,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhabitants</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bocairente‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX> are impressive: the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museo Hist√≥rico</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Historical Museum</ENAMEX>) is noted for a collection of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stone Age</ENAMEX> pottery, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museo Parroquial</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parish Museum</ENAMEX>) exhibits important paintings by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Juan de Juanes</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ribalta</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sorolla</ENAMEX>. In the hills nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">are Iberian cave tombs</ENAMEX>, referred to locally as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Covetes de Moros</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moorish Caves</ENAMEX>). Some were later lived in by hardy <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> holy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>.
Benidorm
With twin, crescent-moon beaches, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">7 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4 miles</NUMEX>) of golden <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sands</ENAMEX>, and an outstanding climate, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Benidorm</ENAMEX> is one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spain‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most popular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX>. But it wasn‚Äôt always so. Despite efforts over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a hundred years ago</TIMEX> by a local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">entrepreneur</ENAMEX>, who hoped to bring holiday-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">makers</ENAMEX> to the area by a regular stage coach service, large-scale tourism didn‚Äôt come to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Benidorm</ENAMEX> until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1960s</TIMEX>. Since then, a mass of apartment <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">blocks</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> has sprung up and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> has become known as an international fun <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Some 250,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> pack into the place in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX>.
Love it or hate it, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Benidorm</ENAMEX> is thoroughly cosmopolitan: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Restaurants</ENAMEX> here serve <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacon</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sauerkraut</ENAMEX>, smorgasbord, and ‚Äútea like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> makes it.‚Äù There are bars, cocktail <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lounges</ENAMEX>, ritzy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, modern <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX>, and a vast choice of discotheques and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">nightclubs</ENAMEX>. This makes for a happy, human, unending noise that contradicts those who say the town‚Äôs name derives from the valenciano words for ‚Äúsleep well.‚Äù
The delightful old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX>, the size of a postage stamp, is tucked away on the long spur of land that divides the two beaches. A fort stood here until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1812</TIMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> blew it up while dislodging the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> during <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Spain‚Äôs War</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Independence</ENAMEX>, leaving only ruins. The greatest concentration of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> and entertainments is to be found around the original <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX>. Away from the beaches there‚Äôs no end to the amusements, from bowling <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">alleys</ENAMEX> to water slides. 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Isla de Benidorm</ENAMEX>, a wedge-shaped rock of an island you can see from any of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Benidorm‚</ENAMEX>Äôs beaches, is an unofficial bird <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">sanctuary</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">uninhabited</ENAMEX> except for a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> bar. It‚Äôs a good spot for a picnic and swim, although the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> is deep. Boat trips from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Benidorm</ENAMEX> average <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20 minutes</TIMEX> each way; make arrangements to return on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of your boatman‚Äôs <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later</TIMEX> runs.
Inland from Benidorm
The mountains you see off in the distance on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Benidorm‚</ENAMEX>Äôs horizon are fragrant with wild herbs and lavender, and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">hedges</ENAMEX> are lush with blackberries that few local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> bother to pick. Drive south on the motorway to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Villajoyosa</ENAMEX>, then take the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> that leads to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sella</ENAMEX>. The countryside is undistinguished, until suddenly you look down on the emerald-green waters of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Amadorio Dam</ENAMEX>, a favourite haunt of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fishermen</ENAMEX> and discerning <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">picnickers</ENAMEX>. Within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">another 5 km</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 miles</NUMEX>) you arrive at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sella</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX>, dwarfed beneath an extraordinary plateau.
From <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sella</ENAMEX> the road winds higher through terraced <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hillsides</ENAMEX> filled with vines until it reaches its highest point at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Puerto de Tud√≥ns</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,015 metres/3,345 feet</NUMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">About 8 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 miles</NUMEX>) on, a secondary road leads to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pe√±aguila</ENAMEX>, an exquisite old <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Moorish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> with a sturdy ruined <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX>.
At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Benasau</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sella</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> meets the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-3313</ENAMEX>. To the west (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">16 km/10 miles</NUMEX>) lies <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alcoy</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>), to the east <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Confrides</ENAMEX>, a picturesque mountain <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>.
Now make for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guadalest</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">some 10 km/6miles</NUMEX> to the east), the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Costa Blanca‚</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Äôs famed ‚Äúeagle‚Äôs nest‚Äù fortress</ENAMEX>, built by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moors</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1,200 years ago</TIMEX>. Inaccessible except for a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tunnel</ENAMEX> carved through <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15 metres</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 feet</NUMEX>) of solid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rock</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guadalest</ENAMEX> was never conquered, though <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">James I of Aragon</ENAMEX> took it by siege during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 13th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Reconquest</ENAMEX>. The fortress even withstood an earthquake in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1644</TIMEX>, as well as attempts by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Austrian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Archduke</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles</ENAMEX> to blast his way in during the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">War of the Spanish Succession</ENAMEX>. Guadalest itself is just as spectacular as the view from it. Wandering round the compact <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX>, you‚Äôll understand why, for lack of space, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">belfry</ENAMEX> had to be built outside, and why the picturesque old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cemetery</ENAMEX> is so small.
From <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Guadalest</ENAMEX>, the road leads to the small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Callosa de Ensarri√°</ENAMEX>, centre of the honey industry, where you can taste before you buy, often <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six or eight</NUMEX> different flavours. From <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Callosa</ENAMEX> take the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Parcent</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>, follow it for <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">21‚ÅÑ2 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">11‚ÅÑ2 miles</NUMEX>), and make a right-hand turn at the entrance to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Algar</ENAMEX> waterfalls, a tumbling oasis beneath the massive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sierra Bernia</ENAMEX> formed by a tributary of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">River Guadalest</ENAMEX>. Leave your <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> in the parking <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">area</ENAMEX> and walk to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX>-metre (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">80-foot</NUMEX>) falls. You can swim beneath them in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">chilly</TIMEX> waters, then picnic by the cool, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">leafy</TIMEX> pools above. It‚Äôs easy to get away from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowds</ENAMEX> in this pleasant spot, but if you‚Äôre in the mood for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>, you‚Äôll find lots of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> near the car <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>.
The next stop is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T√°rbena</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 km/6 miles</NUMEX> farther along the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-3318</ENAMEX>), an invigorating mountain village famed for its <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">delicious sausages</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">They‚Äôre</ENAMEX> made from a secret recipe handed down to the present-day <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">villagers</ENAMEX> by their Mallorcan ancestors, who came here in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 17th century</TIMEX> as part of an official repopulation scheme. 
After <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T√°rbena</ENAMEX> comes the finest scenery of all: bold, terraced mountains, wide undulating valleys, and scattered <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">farms</ENAMEX> connected by mule <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tracks</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">spring</TIMEX> the countryside is covered with the pink and white of almond blossoms, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> is for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all seasons</TIMEX>, with groves of gnarled olive <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> alongside it, their leaves blowing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">silver</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the evening</TIMEX> light. Follow the road to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Coll de Rates</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> metres (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,500 feet</NUMEX>) above the wide orange- and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">vine</ENAMEX>-filled plains that sweep up to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">J√°vea</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Denia, Gand√≠a</ENAMEX>, and the deep-blue <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX>. Farther on, take the road to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jalon</ENAMEX>, where in late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX> sell <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">muscat grapes</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passers-by</ENAMEX>, and you can buy some of the strong local <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX>. Or carry on past <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Orba</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Benidoleig</ENAMEX> and visit the prehistoric caves, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Las Calaveras</ENAMEX>. Here <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">high-domed</NUMEX> ceilings drip with stalagtites, and human bones <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 50,000</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years old</TIMEX> have been found.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Six</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">km</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">31‚ÅÑ2 miles</NUMEX>) more bring you to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Valencia‚ÄìAlicante</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">highway</ENAMEX> near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ondara</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Coast</ENAMEX>
The fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Pola</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">18 km,</NUMEX> south of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alicante</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-332</ENAMEX>) has an extraordinary number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>. Nearby waters, particularly rich in prawns and red mullet, provide all manner of eating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>, both on the beach and in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, with some of the best <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seafood</ENAMEX> on the coast. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">There‚Äôs</ENAMEX> also a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> and several good beaches with fine, white <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sand</ENAMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Thousands</NUMEX> of pines, <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">palms</ENAMEX>, and eucalyptus <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>, planted to control shifting sand dunes, shade the beaches at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guardamar del Segura</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">17 km/10 miles</NUMEX> south again on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-332</ENAMEX>), an important fishing centre. Spiny lobsters are a speciality of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guardamar</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>. From here, the road travels a further <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">15 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">9 miles</NUMEX>), past the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX> flats of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Mata</ENAMEX>, to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Torrevieja</ENAMEX>.
The long-vanished ‚Äúold tower‚Äù from which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Torrevieja</ENAMEX> took its name has been replaced by a new one, built with funds raised by expatriate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX>. The expanding summer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> and its long, sandy beaches co-exist with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Europe‚</ENAMEX>Äôs largest and oldest salt industry. The enormous mountain of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt you‚</ENAMEX>Äôll see comes from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Mata</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Torrevieja</ENAMEX> pans. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Visitors</ENAMEX> are welcome <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesdays</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Thursdays</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5:00 p.m. Request</TIMEX> passes from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nueva Compa√±√</ENAMEX>≠a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arrendataria de las Salinas de Torrevieja</ENAMEX> on the port‚Äôs main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Photography</ENAMEX> permits are harder to get.)
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August</TIMEX> Torrevieja pulsates to the music of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Habaneras festival</ENAMEX>. The theme is the lively, song form of the same name (remember <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bizet‚Äôs Carmen</ENAMEX>?), brought back from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX>-export voyages. The festivities include musical competitions, concerts, and shows by <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">leading¬†‚Äî¬†sometimes international¬†‚Äî¬†companies</ENAMEX>.
On down the coast road we get to a string of growing resorts forming a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer holiday</TIMEX> centre¬<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">†‚Äî¬†La Zenia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cabo Roig</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campoamor</ENAMEX>.
Another <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6 miles</NUMEX>) to the south lies the natural wonder of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Costa C√°lida</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mar Menor</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt water</ENAMEX> lagoon separated from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> strips of land known collectively as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Manga</ENAMEX>. The shallow lagoon of is calmer and saltier than the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX>, so you sink less easily. It can also be several degrees warmer, which accounts for the thermal breezes and mellow summer temperatures. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">It‚Äôs</ENAMEX> even mildly <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rich¬†‚Äî¬†and becoming richer¬†‚Äî¬†in mineral salts</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mar Menor</ENAMEX> is a sportsman‚Äôs paradise. You can sign on for sailing, scuba-diving, and wind-surfing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX>, and water-ski on its tranquil waters. On shore there is considerable scope for <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">tennis</ENAMEX>, or you can try clay<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">-pigeon</NUMEX> shooting. For <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">golfers</ENAMEX> there are twin 18-hole <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kentucky</ENAMEX> blue-grass <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX>, and the local golf club has a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ranch</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hires</ENAMEX> out mounts for riding.
The area of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mar Menor</ENAMEX> is also noted for its windmills, some of them restored to perfect working condition. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Manga</ENAMEX> has been developed as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX>, with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> and apartment <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">blocks</ENAMEX> straddling the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">23 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">14 miles</NUMEX>) of sand that separate the two seas. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">You‚Äôll</ENAMEX> find the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Casino del Mar Menor</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hotel Doblemar</ENAMEX>, halfway along <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">La Manga</ENAMEX>. The mainland side of the lagoon boasts the smaller but thriving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santiago de la Ribera</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Alc√°zares</ENAMEX>, both of which are popular with service <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> from the air base inland at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">San Javier</ENAMEX>.
The compact, bustling <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cartagena</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">26 km/6 miles</NUMEX> south of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Alc√</ENAMEX>°zares on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-332</ENAMEX>) was a major naval <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX> long before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint James</ENAMEX> is said to have landed here with the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Gospel in a.d. 36</ENAMEX>. Romans, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Visigoths</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moors</ENAMEX> all squabbled over the strategically positioned <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, which was sacked by Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis Drake</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1588</TIMEX> and taken by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Archduke Charles</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1707</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Head</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX> and the large waterfront <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plaza del Ayuntamiento</ENAMEX>. The big, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">grey</ENAMEX>, cigar-shaped object you‚Äôll see on view here is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">submarine</ENAMEX>, built by the local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inventor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isaac Peral</ENAMEX> and launched in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1888</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten years</TIMEX> too late to make a world record.
Just north of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Plaza</ENAMEX>, take a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the open-air caf√©s on the traffic-free <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Calle</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mayor</ENAMEX>. Then head uphill to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Castillo de la Concepci√≥n</ENAMEX> at the highest point of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> dates back to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> and perhaps even <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carthaginian</ENAMEX> times. <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">It‚Äôs</ENAMEX> surrounded by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Parque de las Torres</ENAMEX>, a beautifully landscaped vantage point. The pepper-pot lighthouse in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>, of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> or Moorish origin, wrecked many a marauding <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ship</ENAMEX> when it was blacked out by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cartagena‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defenders</ENAMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> glance over the almost landlocked harbour explains why <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrea Doria</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Genoese</ENAMEX> admiral, remarked that the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX> had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only three</NUMEX> safe <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ports</ENAMEX>: <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cartagena</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">You‚Äôll</ENAMEX> also see why <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cartagena</ENAMEX> is called the ‚ÄúCity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Castles</ENAMEX>.‚Äù Almost every hill has one: to the northeast there‚Äôs a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moorish fort</ENAMEX>; no <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fewer than four</NUMEX> ruined fortresses guard the harbour entrance; and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> more, still in good <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">repair¬†‚Äî¬†the Atalaya</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Galeras castles¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†protect the sea-front <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">arsenal</ENAMEX>, of vital importance to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spain‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">military</ENAMEX>.
Immediately west of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Castillo de la Concepci√≥n</ENAMEX> are the ruins of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 13th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iglesia de Santa Mar√≠a Vieja</ENAMEX>. Its <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Romanesque</ENAMEX> portal is a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19th-century</TIMEX> restoration, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Byzantine</ENAMEX> columns, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> mosaic floor, are authentic. In the adjacent <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Calle del Ca√±√≥n</ENAMEX>, look for the well-head with weathered rope-marks that traditionally inspired <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint Isidore</ENAMEX>, the youngest of a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixth-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Visigoth</ENAMEX> duke‚Äôs four saintly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, to argue the merits of perseverance.
Quite a long trek to the northwest is the small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Museo Arqueol√≥gico</ENAMEX>, noted for its exceptional collection of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> mining tools used to extract the considerable mineral wealth of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Uni√≥n</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a neighbouring</NUMEX> inland <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mines</ENAMEX> there continue to yield lead, which is exported from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cartagena</ENAMEX> as it has been for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX>.
Although the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Costa C√</ENAMEX>°lida extending southwest beyond <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cartagena</ENAMEX> has opened up to property development, you can still find <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">quieter</ENAMEX> stretches of beach. It‚Äôs a campers‚Äô paradise, too, but drinking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> can be hard to find away from the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>.
The first stop is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto de Mazarr√≥n</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">34 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">21 miles</NUMEX>) beyond <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cartagena</ENAMEX>. The spacious beaches here have long been patronized by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX>. Now all of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> has caught on. You‚Äôll know √Åguilas, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23,000</NUMEX> people <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 50 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">30 miles</NUMEX>) farther on, by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">its 16th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX>, which dominates the area. The town offers a wide sandy bay and, to the north, swimming from the rocks around <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Cabo Cope</ENAMEX>. To the south lie long beaches, excellent for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year-round</TIMEX> camping.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-332</ENAMEX> now strikes inland for <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">32 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">19 miles</NUMEX>) to the small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cuevas de Almanzora</ENAMEX>, in a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">hilly</NUMEX> region once inhabited by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stone Age</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>. Many of the numerous caves hereabouts (from which the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> takes its name) are inhabited by local gypsies.
Follow the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-332</ENAMEX> a little farther to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vera</ENAMEX>, then take the road to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Garrucha</ENAMEX> and the coast (the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-340</ENAMEX> continues inland until <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Almer√≠a</ENAMEX>). There are <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6 miles</NUMEX>) of wild, rocky beaches with a dramatic mountain backdrop. 
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Five km</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 miles</NUMEX>) more bring you to thriving <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Moj√°car</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> planted on the eastern extremity of the rugged <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sierra Cabrera</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Purists</ENAMEX> complain that the cubist effect of steep hillsides dotted with <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>, flat-roofed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> has been spoiled by modern development, but the beaches all around are still pleasant.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">About 3,000 years ago</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moj√°car</ENAMEX> was an important <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Phoenician</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port</ENAMEX>, but earthquakes and major geological upheavals have left it high and dry. For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moj√</ENAMEX>°car were kept behind the veil, and the place is still known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚ÄúVillage of the Covered Ones</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Interestingly</ENAMEX>, there‚Äôs an elegant white statue of a veiled <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>.) Its renown as the ‚ÄúVillage of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Witches‚Äù</ENAMEX> comes from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moj√</ENAMEX>°car‚Äôs long and continuing flirtation with faith healing, spells, and magic brews. This isolated <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> is the last bastion of the mystical sign of the dalo, a figure holding a rainbow over his head that was believed to be a talisman against the evil eye. (The word comes from an old <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Iberian</ENAMEX> term meaning <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚ÄúLord of All</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù) Nowadays</ENAMEX>, you are more likely to see the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indalo</ENAMEX> in the form of a lucky charm on sale in souvenir <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> rather than painted, as it once was, on house doors. 
The narrow coastal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> continues another <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">22 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">19 miles</NUMEX>) weaving through a moody landscape of barren mountains to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carboneras</ENAMEX>. The long, sandy beaches here are another favourite spot for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">camping</TIMEX> excursions.
From <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Carboneras</ENAMEX>, the road travels <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">41 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">25 miles</NUMEX>) inland through sweeping, treeless moorland to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N√≠jar.</ENAMEX> This developing <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Andalusian hilltop</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> is a busy centre for potters, and the narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> of the old town centre invite exploration. Look for local ceramics with their characteristic design of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">tiger</ENAMEX> stripes and splashes, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">colours</ENAMEX> deliberately allowed to run.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South of Nijar</ENAMEX>, spectacular cliffs and isolated beaches mark the hard-to-reach natural <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cabo de Gata</ENAMEX>. 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moorish Legacy Inland</ENAMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> historic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">towns¬†‚Äî¬†Elche</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crevillente, Orihuela</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Murcia¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†line the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-340 from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alicante</ENAMEX>. The most distant of them, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Murcia</ENAMEX>, is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only about 80 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">48 miles</NUMEX>) away and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all four</NUMEX> can be visited in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of days</TIMEX>. While these <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> have been influenced by various cultures, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moorish</ENAMEX> legacy is predominant in each.
Elche
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Thousands</NUMEX> upon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of date palms overwhelm the eye in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Elche</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> as old as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iberians</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>, originally planted by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carthaginians</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">300 b.c.</TIMEX> or thereabouts, thrive under irrigation. They still stand as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moors</ENAMEX> described them, with ‚Äúfeet in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heads</ENAMEX> in the fire of heaven.<ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">‚Äù Elche‚Äôs palms</ENAMEX> are watered by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abderraman III‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tenth</NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-century</TIMEX> irrigation system and surround the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 200,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhabitants</ENAMEX> on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sides</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hort del Cura</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Priest‚Äôs Grove</ENAMEX>) is celebrated even in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Elche</ENAMEX> for its cactus, pomegranate, and orange <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>, and above all, for the palmera imperial. This male <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> of exceptional age and size has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branches</ENAMEX> growing from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> main trunk. The palmera imperial and many other <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">grove</ENAMEX> have been dedicated to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">royalty</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">celebrities</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carmen Polo de Franco</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">widow</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General√≠simo.</ENAMEX>
Overlooking the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">grove‚Äôs lily pond</ENAMEX> is an exact replica of the famous bust of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dama de Elche</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Lady of Elche</ENAMEX>). The original, dating from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">500 b.c.</NUMEX> and now housed in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madrid‚Äôs Archaeological Museum</ENAMEX>, remains something of a puzzle <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">almost a hundred years</TIMEX> after it came to light. If you cover that exotic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headdress</ENAMEX>, you‚Äôll see why <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attributions</ENAMEX> are difficult to make: The face could be male or female, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eastern</ENAMEX>.
To visit the place where the bust was discovered, go to the nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">hamlet</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Alcudia</ENAMEX>. Be sure to see the exhibits of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iberian</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> finds displayed in the excellent local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>. On the way, you‚Äôll see <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">palms</ENAMEX> that look rather like giant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">asparagus</ENAMEX> tips. Encapuchadores bind these male <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">spring</TIMEX> to produce the pale, bleached <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">fronds</ENAMEX> that are used in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Palm</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> celebrations. These <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branches</ENAMEX>, once suitably blessed, are said to conduct lightning, and you‚Äôll see them attached to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> all over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>. The female palms make a less esoteric <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> contribution of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10,000 tons</NUMEX> of dates, which ripen in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December</TIMEX> and are prized for their juicy sweetness.
Back in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Elche</ENAMEX>, there are more palm <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> to see and more luxuriant tropical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foliage</ENAMEX> to admire. You can dine and dance in the frond-slatted shade of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parque Municipal</ENAMEX>, which also features citrus <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> and a noisy frog pond. Or visit the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hort de Baix</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hort del Chocolater</ENAMEX> (the latter open at irregular <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">intervals)¬†‚Äî¬†these</ENAMEX> groves help make <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elche</ENAMEX> one of the most verdant <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>.
Not far from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Municipal Park</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Calahorra Tower</ENAMEX>, ‚ÄúGuardian of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Elche,‚Äù</ENAMEX> once formed part of the main gate in the long-vanished wall that surrounded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Elche</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moorish</ENAMEX> times.
Next to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> you‚Äôll see the blue <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dome</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iglesia de Santa Mar√≠a.</ENAMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> was built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th century</TIMEX> and rebuilt after being damaged during <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the Civil War</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Every August</TIMEX> a spectacular form of sacred theatre, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">El Misterio de Elche</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Mystery of Elche</ENAMEX>), is performed here by an amateur <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cast</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priests</ENAMEX>, civic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dignitaries</ENAMEX>, and other local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. The play has been presented in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Elche</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than five centuries</TIMEX>. The music, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gregorian</ENAMEX> and traditional, is sung in old <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">lemos√≠n</ENAMEX>. However, the story it tells of the Assumption of the Virgin is quite easily understood. 
Across the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> from the church you can‚Äôt miss the solid <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alc√°zar de la Se√±or√≠a</ENAMEX>, known locally as the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Palacio de los Altamira</ENAMEX>, with its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square towers</ENAMEX>. This <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moorish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> formed part of the city <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wall</ENAMEX>. In times past, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> monarchs such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James the Conqueror</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferdinand</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isabella</ENAMEX> stayed here.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Vinalop√≥ River</ENAMEX>, spanned by a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX> here, supplies the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> that is still carried to the horts in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canals</ENAMEX> dug by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moors</ENAMEX>.
A short distance from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> toward the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city centre</ENAMEX>, you come upon the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ayuntamiento</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Town Hall</ENAMEX>), with its fine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> fa√ßade and Gothic door. Stand back for a good look at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 14th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Torre del Concejo</ENAMEX>, a former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">watchtower</ENAMEX>. The quaint carved figures of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calendura</ENAMEX> and Calendureta ring the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours and quarter hours</TIMEX>, as they have done since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1759</TIMEX>.
Crevillente
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Nineteenth-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">travellers</ENAMEX> sped through neighbouring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crevillente</ENAMEX> in fear of the notorious bandit <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James the Bearded</ENAMEX>. Today, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Crevillente‚Äôs</ENAMEX> industrial appearance similarly induces haste. But those unattractive <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factories</ENAMEX> produce <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70 percent</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spain‚</ENAMEX>Äôs handsome woven rugs and carpets, and many invite <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>.
Crevillente was the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">birthplace</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">surgeon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al-Xafra</ENAMEX>, and during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">his 13th-century</TIMEX> heyday, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> was a good place in which to fall ill. The progressive <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Moor‚Äôs treatise on ‚Äúwounds</ENAMEX>, inflammations, and tumours‚Äù may sound hair-raising <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, but his treatment of broken bones by padded splints, traction, and bitumen casts was actually centuries ahead of its time.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Museo Municipal Mariano Benlliure</ENAMEX>, alongside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>, contains a collection of works in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bronze</ENAMEX>, marble, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">clay</ENAMEX> by the modern sculptor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mariano Benlliure</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1868‚Äì1947</ENAMEX>), among them likenesses of the famous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">his day</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">You‚Äôll</ENAMEX> also see some of his <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pasos¬†‚Äî¬†sculpture</ENAMEX> in life size or larger, a feature of religious processions, particularly during <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holy Week</ENAMEX>.
Orihuela
Situated on the usually peaceful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">River Segura, Orihuela</ENAMEX> is a few kilometres (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a couple of miles</NUMEX>) off the busy <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A-7</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Water</ENAMEX> is drawn from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Segura</ENAMEX> for the irrigation of the town‚Äôs groves and fields. When the expulsion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">moriscos¬†‚Äî¬†once the town‚Äôs agricultural labourers¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†threatened the fertility of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">Orihuela‚Äôs crops</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1609</TIMEX>, brave townspeople hid away enough converted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moors</ENAMEX> to ensure a good harvest.
The old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">university</ENAMEX>, on the northern outskirts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, was constructed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16th and 17th centuries</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">It‚Äôs</ENAMEX> now a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Colegio de Santo Domingo</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Dominic‚Äôs School</ENAMEX>). Ask permission to visit the spreading baroque cloisters, magnificent staircase, and beautifully tiled refectory. Near the school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">you‚Äôll</ENAMEX> see all that‚Äôs left of the town‚Äôs original wall, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Puerta de la Olma</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Elm Tree Gate</ENAMEX>).
Now make for the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Plaza de Caturla</ENAMEX>, a small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> on the western outskirts of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Orihuela</ENAMEX>. From here you can ascend a hill to the old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Seminario de San Miguel</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint Michael‚Äôs Seminary</ENAMEX>) which offers panoramic views of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Orihuela</ENAMEX> below and a ruined <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> above.
There are many historic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> to see in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Orihuela</ENAMEX>; the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> remains much as it was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries ago</TIMEX>, despite an earthquake in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1829</TIMEX> and present-day industrialization. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Gothic cathedral</ENAMEX>, begun in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 14th century</TIMEX>, with spiral rib <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vaulting</ENAMEX> and ornamental grille-work, is considered one of the region‚Äôs finest. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museo Diocesano de Arte Sacro</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diocesan Museum of Sacred Art</ENAMEX>) features a famous painting by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vel√°zquez</ENAMEX>, called the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Temptation of Saint Thomas Aquinas</ENAMEX>. 
The fine <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Romanesque</ENAMEX> cloister was moved here from a nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">convent</ENAMEX> that suffered damage in the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Civil War</ENAMEX>. It was erected around an early <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Gothic</ENAMEX> cross that is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Orihuela‚</ENAMEX>Äôs austere monument to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Spain‚Äôs</ENAMEX> war dead.
Orihuela‚Äôs new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museo de Semana Santa</ENAMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Easter Week Museum</ENAMEX>) features the massive floats by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salzillo</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX>, depicting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Biblical</ENAMEX> scenes with life-like statues. A bizarre curiosity here is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paso de la Diablesa</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">She-Devil Statue</ENAMEX>). The ghastly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">horned</ENAMEX> face of the devil has been terrifying the irreverent into repentance since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1688</TIMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nicolas de Busi</ENAMEX> carved it. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Every year</TIMEX> the she-devil and her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">companion</ENAMEX>, a carved skeleton, are trundled through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Orihuela</ENAMEX> as a ‚Äúwarning to the wise.‚Äù 
Murcia
Like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elche</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Orihuela, Murcia</ENAMEX> has been a rich oasis since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moorish</ENAMEX> times. Its market gardens, second only to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valencia‚Äôs</ENAMEX>, are watered by the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">River Segura</ENAMEX> and yet another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moorish</ENAMEX> irrigation system. Today‚Äôs provincial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> was a favourite <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moors</ENAMEX> and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1224</TIMEX> they even made it the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> of a small taifa, or break-away <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">kingdom</ENAMEX>.
The most celebrated local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hero</ENAMEX> was the powerful yet benign <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cardinal Belluga y Moncada</ENAMEX>. This warlike prelate thwarted the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all</NUMEX>-conquering <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Archduke Charles</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Austria</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1707</TIMEX>, during the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">War of the Spanish Succession</ENAMEX>, preventing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Charles</ENAMEX> from advancing by flooding <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Murcia‚Äôs</ENAMEX> fields, then attacking the invader with a small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX> recruited at his own expense. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Murcia‚Äôs cathedral</ENAMEX> stands on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plaza</ENAMEX> named in honour of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cardinal Belluga</ENAMEX>. Construction of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catedral de Santa Mar√≠a</ENAMEX> (on the site of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX>) began in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1394</TIMEX>. There‚Äôs not a hint of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 14th century</TIMEX> in its splendid western fa√ßade, however. This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baroque</ENAMEX> renovation, one of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jaime Bort‚Äôs</ENAMEX> celebrated designs, was undertaken when the original <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gothic</ENAMEX> front suffered irreparable damage in a disastrous flood of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Segura</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1735</TIMEX>. You can climb the round <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> that rises from the north side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>. There‚Äôs an impressive view at the top of its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> storeys, which are easily ascended.
Inside the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">cathedral</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Capilla de los V√©lez</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Chapel of the V√©lez</ENAMEX>) is remarkable for its Plateresque decoration. This highly ornamental style is typical of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>. The coro (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">choir</ENAMEX>) shelters a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christ</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francisco Salzillo</ENAMEX>, one of many supremely realistic works by this native <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Murcia</ENAMEX>. Others (a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saint Jerome</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virgin</ENAMEX>) are on display among the chalices and retablos of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museo Diocesano</ENAMEX>, adjoining the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Cathedral</ENAMEX>.
Before you leave the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">sanctuary</ENAMEX>, visit the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Capilla Mayor</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Main Chapel</ENAMEX>). The strangest of the cathedral‚Äôs treasures is contained in an <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">urn here¬†‚Äî¬†the heart</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alfonso the Wise</ENAMEX>, bequeathed to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Murcia</ENAMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 13th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX> long before his death.
Go out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">cathedral</ENAMEX> on the north side and walk across <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Plaza Hernandez Amores</ENAMEX> to the cool and classy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calle de la Traper√≠a</ENAMEX> (Street of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Secondhand Merchants</ENAMEX>). But don‚Äôt look for bargains here; the name of this pedestrian <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">thoroughfare</ENAMEX> belies the elegance of its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>. At the north end you come upon the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Casino</ENAMEX> (a private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">club</ENAMEX>, not a gambling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">establishment</ENAMEX>), with spirited turn-of-the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">century</TIMEX> decor. The entrance <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX>, an exact copy of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hall of Ambassadors</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Seville‚Äôs Alc√°zar</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ladies‚Äô lavatory¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†with its ceiling of cherubs¬†‚Äî¬†are the most magnificent <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX>. (Don‚Äôt forget a small tip to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">steward</ENAMEX> who shows you around.)
During the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Casino‚</ENAMEX>Äôs heyday, the pedestrian <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calle de la Plater√≠a</ENAMEX> (Street of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Silversmiths</ENAMEX>), at right angles to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Traper√≠a</ENAMEX>, was full of practising <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">craftsmen</ENAMEX>. Flower stalls in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Plaza de las Flores</ENAMEX> are open <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">every morning</TIMEX>. After <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">11:00 a.m.</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendors</ENAMEX> tend to retreat into nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bars</ENAMEX>, particularly in hot weather.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city centre</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ermita de Jes√</ENAMEX>∫s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> and its impressive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museo Salzillo</ENAMEX>. The highly important <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of sculptures gathered here represents every facet of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Francisco Salzillo‚</ENAMEX>Äôs work. During a career that spanned <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 18th century</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salzillo</ENAMEX> produced large processional figures still carried in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holy Week</ENAMEX> celebrations, and small, intimate carvings, some of them on a miniature scale. Also with a visit is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museo de Arqueologica</ENAMEX>, on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Calle Gran Via Alfonso</ENAMEX>, which traces the history of the region from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> times.
Waterwheels have been operating in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Murcia</ENAMEX> region for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">over a thousand years</TIMEX>. You can see <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La √ëora</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">31‚ÅÑ2 miles</NUMEX>) from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Murcia</ENAMEX> city <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centre</ENAMEX>. The original wheel has been replaced with a steel one, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moorish</ENAMEX> system is otherwise unchanged. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A few kilometres</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a couple of miles</NUMEX>) farther, in the direction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Granada</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-340</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Museo de la Huerta</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agriculture Museum</ENAMEX>) at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alcantarilla</ENAMEX> adjoins a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> waterwheel, also of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steel</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum</ENAMEX> exhibits present all aspects of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Murcian</ENAMEX> country life, including traditional furnishings.
