A Brief History
Nothing has had a greater impact on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Costa Blanca</ENAMEX> than foreign invasion: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iberians, Phoenicians</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greeks</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Romans, Visigoths</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moors</ENAMEX> had moulded <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Spain‚Äôs Mediterranean</ENAMEX> shores <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX> before international tourism gained a foothold. But before any of these were the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Costa Blanca‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhabitants</ENAMEX>: Known as <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Neanderthal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>, they lived primitively and spent a large part of their time hunting. Then, as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stone Age</ENAMEX> came to an end, short, dark-skinned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iberians</ENAMEX> started to make their way from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North Africa</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Peninsula</ENAMEX>. These fierce <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fighters</ENAMEX> skilled in guerrilla warfare roamed the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX> foothills, painting a vivid record of their battles on the walls of their rock <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shelters</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Celts</ENAMEX> began to flood into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">north</ENAMEX> sometime after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">900</NUMEX> b.c. They settled in the north and west of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, never penetrating as far as the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Costa Blanca</ENAMEX>. In central <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> they were slowly absorbed by the reluctant <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Iberians</ENAMEX>, but elsewhere both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tribes</ENAMEX> kept fiercely apart, establishing from the first the renowned independence that still characterizes <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain‚Äôs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">provinces</ENAMEX>.
Early Traders
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phoenicians</ENAMEX> ventured across the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">present-day</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lebanon</ENAMEX>, reaching <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> by about 1100 b.c. They founded many trading settlements in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚Äúremote‚Äù</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúhidden land‚Äù they named <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Span or Spania</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Costa Blanca</ENAMEX> was soon dotted with such <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Phoenician</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Elche</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">J√°tiva.</ENAMEX>
After <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 650 b.c.</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> arrived on the coast to compete for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spain‚</ENAMEX>Äôs rich mineral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">deposits</ENAMEX> and fertile land. The influence of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX> was short-lived, although the olive and the grape, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> legacies, are cultivated in the region.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carthaginians</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> related to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phoenicians</ENAMEX>, came from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North Africa</ENAMEX> and subsequently took over much of southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>, beginning with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C√</ENAMEX>°diz in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">501 b.c.</TIMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> had sought help from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Carthaginian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX> in its war against local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tribes</ENAMEX>, and the ‚Äúinvited guest‚Äù decided to stay. The main centre of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carthaginian</ENAMEX> power in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> was located on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Costa Blanca</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carthago Nova</ENAMEX>, now <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cartagena</ENAMEX>, followed in prominence by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alicante</ENAMEX>.
Carthage, challenged by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Punic War</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">264‚Äì241 b.c.</ENAMEX>), lost most of her neglected holdings in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iberian</ENAMEX> attacks. But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carthage‚</ENAMEX>Äôs luck changed with an initial victory in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Punic War</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">218‚Äì201 b.c.</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hannibal</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carthaginian</ENAMEX> general, led <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of history‚Äôs greatest military marches the length of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Costa Blanca</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX>, crossing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pyrenees</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alps</ENAMEX>, in the hope of surprising an unsuspecting <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Romans</ENAMEX> riposted by invading <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> to cut off Hannibal‚Äôs supply route and staying there <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">600 years</TIMEX>.
Under <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman Rule</ENAMEX>
It took the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Romans</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">almost 300 years</TIMEX> to subdue the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Iberian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tribes</ENAMEX>. Outpost duty was decidedly unpopular with the legionnaires, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX> finally prevailed.
There‚Äôs no doubt that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> presence in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> had a great influence on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, bringing the gifts of engineering and architecture. Stability and unity were promoted by the introduction of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Latin</ENAMEX>, from which modern <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> developed; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> law, still the basis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spain‚</ENAMEX>Äôs legal system; and, eventually, Christianity.
But the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX>, overstretched and increasingly corrupt, began to crumble. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Romans</ENAMEX> withdrew from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>, leaving the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> to be overrun by various barbarian <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tribes</ENAMEX>, especially the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vandals</ENAMEX>. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tribes</ENAMEX> were eventually subdued by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Visigoths</ENAMEX>, who controlled much of southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">some 300 years</TIMEX>. But they did not integrate, nor did they learn the lessons of history; in a palace intrigue, one <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">faction</ENAMEX> invited the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moors</ENAMEX> into the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> as their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">allies</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moorish Domination</ENAMEX>
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a.d. 711</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tariq</ENAMEX> landed at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gibraltar</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Berber</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX>. Thus began <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">an 800-year</TIMEX> epoch of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> opposition to the newly arrived <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslims</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moors‚Äîthe</ENAMEX> name commonly given to all <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslims</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain‚</ENAMEX>Äîcarried all before them. Within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten years</TIMEX> their green-crescent standard flew over most of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>. Kartajanah, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mursiyah</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xativa</ENAMEX> are still known by their <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Moorish</ENAMEX> names.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moors</ENAMEX> were relatively tolerant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rulers</ENAMEX> who taxed non-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">believers</ENAMEX> rather than trying to convert them. They introduced the manufacture of paper, which is carried on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">J√°tiva.</ENAMEX> They laid out a system of irrigation still in use in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Guadalest Valley</ENAMEX> and filled the huertas (orchards) of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Costa Blanca</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oranges</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peaches</ENAMEX>, and pomegranates. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rice</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">cotton</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sugar cane</ENAMEX> were also first cultivated on <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> soil by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moors</ENAMEX>.
Numerous <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Moorish</ENAMEX> fortifications on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Costa Blanca</ENAMEX> survive to this day, and the pottery of the region still reflects the influence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moorish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">craftsmen</ENAMEX>. Learning was considerably advanced by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moors</ENAMEX>, and a medical treatise written by an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Crevillente</ENAMEX> is recognized <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">revolutionary</ENAMEX> for its time.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tide Turns</ENAMEX>
But, like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Visigoths</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moors</ENAMEX> ignored history. Feeling the rising strength of Christianity and weakened by constant fighting among themselves, they sought outside help from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Almohades</ENAMEX>. These fanatical <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Berber warriors</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">present-day</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Morocco</ENAMEX> quickly reduced <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moorish Spain</ENAMEX> to a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX> of their <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">North African</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX>, endowing it with enough strength to resist the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> forces a while longer.
Fortunes swayed to and fro for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX>, but it was not until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1212</TIMEX>, at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Las Navas de Tolosa</ENAMEX> in northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>, that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christians</ENAMEX> gained their <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> decisive victory. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">provinces</ENAMEX> gradually captured and annexed former bastions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moorish</ENAMEX> rule: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferdinand III</ENAMEX> conquered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Murcia</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Castile</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1242</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Denia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">J√°tiva</ENAMEX> fell to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James the Conqueror</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aragon</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1244</TIMEX>, though it was not until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1265</TIMEX> that he secured <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cartagena</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moors</ENAMEX> were on the retreat, withdrawing to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">the almost impregnable</NUMEX> mountain fortress area of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Granada</ENAMEX>, where they held out until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1492</TIMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golden Age</ENAMEX>
Spain‚Äôs golden <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">century</TIMEX> began under the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚ÄúCatholic Monarchs,‚Äù a</ENAMEX> title conferred by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pope Alexander VI</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferdinand II</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isabella</ENAMEX>, who united the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> under the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kingdoms</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aragon</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Castile</ENAMEX> after the fall of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Granada</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1492</TIMEX>. That same eventful year, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Columbus</ENAMEX>, seeking a western route to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East</ENAMEX> on behalf of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catholic Monarchs</ENAMEX>, arrived in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Americas</ENAMEX>. And <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferdinand</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isabella</ENAMEX> consolidated <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> rule by decreeing that all <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jews‚Äîthe</ENAMEX> banking and business experts‚Äîmust adopt <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Catholicism</ENAMEX> or be exiled. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moors¬</ENAMEX>†‚Äîthe source of cheap labour and vital agricultural know-how‚Äîwere given the same alternative in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1502</TIMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Segura Valley</ENAMEX> was the last part of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> to be inhabited by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslims</ENAMEX>, who abandoned their fortresses there in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1505</TIMEX>. As the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Inquisition</ENAMEX> established its reign of terror to stamp out heresy, converted <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX>, conversos, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslims</ENAMEX>, moriscos, were looked upon with suspicion, and many left the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> or were condemned to death. Agricultural productivity was to suffer considerably after the official expulsion of the moriscos in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1609</TIMEX>.
The conquest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New World</ENAMEX> brought <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> fame and immense wealth, especially under <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Charles I</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philip II</ENAMEX>, but much was squandered and wasted; slowly the decline set in. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1588</TIMEX>, the immensely powerful but badly led <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Armada</ENAMEX> set out to invade <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX>, only to be beaten by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drake</ENAMEX> and a providential storm. Another important defeat took place at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rocroi</ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Flanders</ENAMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1643</TIMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX>, never to regain their former glory, were routed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> Ascendancy
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> internal affairs became the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> of other great <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">powers</ENAMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles II</ENAMEX> died in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1700</TIMEX> without <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heirs</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Archduke Charles</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Austria</ENAMEX> rivalled <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">France‚Äôs Philip</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bourbon</ENAMEX>, designated to ascend the throne, in the ensuing <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">War of the Spanish Succession</ENAMEX>. On the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Costa Blanca</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murcia</ENAMEX> was defended from the invasion of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Archduke Charles</ENAMEX> by its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bishop</ENAMEX>, with the help of local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J√°tiva</ENAMEX> fought the succession of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philip</ENAMEX> so fiercely that when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> was finally overcome in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1707</TIMEX>, the town‚Äôs name was changed to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Felipe¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†the former name was not to be restored until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th century</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philip</ENAMEX> finally gained the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> throne under the terms of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Treaty</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Utrecht</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1713</TIMEX>.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Nearly a hundred years later</TIMEX>, during the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Napoleonic</ENAMEX> wars, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX> fought alongside the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">fleet</ENAMEX> against <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lord</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nelson</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cape Trafalgar</ENAMEX>, southeast of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C√°diz.</ENAMEX> But as the wars continued, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Napoleon</ENAMEX>, distrustful of his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ally</ENAMEX>, forced the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX> to abdicate in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1808</TIMEX> and imposed his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>. He sent <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> across the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pyrenees</ENAMEX> to subdue the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spaniards</ENAMEX>, who then revolted. Aided by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX>, they drove the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iberian</ENAMEX> peninsula. Denia, held by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enemy</ENAMEX>, was blockaded for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eight months</TIMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1813</TIMEX>. What the world knows as the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Peninsular War</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1808‚Äì1814</ENAMEX>) is referred to in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> as the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">War</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Independence</ENAMEX>, and the country‚Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, though short-lived, constitution was drafted during this period.
From Decline to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chaos</ENAMEX>
Hopes of setting up a constitutional monarchy were quickly dashed, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> was plunged into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a century</TIMEX> of power struggles at home. Overseas, her <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">colonies revolted</ENAMEX> and gained independence. Soon there was little left of the once great <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX>, and an attempt in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1873</TIMEX> to form a republic failed. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1902</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alfonso XIII</ENAMEX> became <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the age of 16</TIMEX>. His reign was a difficult time for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>; prosperity and stability eluded the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, which remained neutral during <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">I.</ENAMEX>
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1923</TIMEX>, assailed by economic problems and with catastrophe imminent, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX> accepted a general, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miguel Primo de Rivera</ENAMEX>, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dictator</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Six years later</TIMEX> the opposition of radical forces resulted in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Primo de Rivera‚Äôs</ENAMEX> fall. Neither reform nor the maintenance of order seemed possible. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1931</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX> himself went into exile following anti-royalist election results, and another <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">republic</ENAMEX> was founded.
Parliamentary democracy was impeded by the ideological commitment of various political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">factions</ENAMEX> and compromise was rare. There was a succession of right-wing attempts to govern and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> floundered in a sea of political strikes and violence. Then the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Left</ENAMEX> won the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1936</TIMEX> elections and was immediately in violent collision with the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Right</TIMEX>.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 1936</TIMEX>, a large section of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX> under <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francisco Franco</ENAMEX> rose in revolt against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>. On <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Franco‚</ENAMEX>Äôs side were monarchists, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conservatives</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Church</ENAMEX>, and the right-wing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Falangists</ENAMEX>. Against him was a collection of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">republicans</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">liberals</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">socialists</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communists</ENAMEX>, and anarchists. The ensuing <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Civil War</ENAMEX> became one of the great crusades of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 20th century</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX> supplied <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Franco‚Äôs Nationalists</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX> and air power, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> gave aid to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spain‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communists</ENAMEX>.
To many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, often unaware of, or indifferent to, the particular <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> origins of the struggle, the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Civil War</ENAMEX> was seen as a crucial conflict between democracy and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">dictatorship</ENAMEX>, or, from the other side, as one of law and order against social revolution and chaos. The bloodshed lasted for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three years</TIMEX> and cost <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds of thousands</NUMEX> of lives.
Even after the war, the hardship continued. But despite pressure from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hitler</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Franco</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spain‚</ENAMEX>Äôs new caudillo (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX>), managed to keep his exhausted <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> out of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War</ENAMEX> II.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Modern Times</ENAMEX>
During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</TIMEX> of post-war reconstruction, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Franco</ENAMEX> encouraged tourism on a grand scale as a way to bring currency into the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. Profoundly affecting the economy and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, this transformed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spain‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most attractive coasts, though not always for the better.
When the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">caudillo</ENAMEX> died in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1975</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prince</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Juan Carlos</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandson</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bourbon King Alfonso XIII</ENAMEX>, succeeded to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> throne. The new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX> firmly led the way from totalitarianism to democracy. A new constitution granted wide-ranging powers to the regions. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> entered the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Community</ENAMEX>, ending <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX> of isolation. While membership brought much-needed funds into the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, troubles like inflation, unemployment, crime, and pollution led to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Conservative Party‚</ENAMEX>Äôs defeat of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Socialist Party</ENAMEX> in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> elections, after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13 years</TIMEX> of dominance.
