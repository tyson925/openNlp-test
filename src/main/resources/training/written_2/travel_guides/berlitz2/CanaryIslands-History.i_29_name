A Brief History
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canary Islands</ENAMEX> are a land of legends. The ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greeks</ENAMEX> thought of them as the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Garden of Hesperides</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Romans</ENAMEX> called this archipelago the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fortunate Islands</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Homer</ENAMEX> tells us that blessed ones were sent to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elysian Fields</ENAMEX> to enjoy eternal happiness in a land where <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> was unknown. Could this have been the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canaries</ENAMEX>?
The author <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Plutarch</ENAMEX> wrote of fertile lands somewhere off the coast of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX>, where the breezes of springtime never stop. His <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> was the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sertorius</ENAMEX>, who had heard of the lands from an explorer.
Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> link the lost continent of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Atlantis</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canaries</ENAMEX>. According to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Plato</ENAMEX> this rich, happy land, lying somewhere to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">west of Gibraltar</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic Ocean</ENAMEX>, was destroyed by earthquakes and tidal waves <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly 12,000</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX>. After the cataclysm only the mountaintops of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Atlantis</ENAMEX> remained above the sea and constituted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> islands. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canaries</ENAMEX> perhaps?
From <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plato</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jules Verne</ENAMEX> the possibilities have stirred people‚Äôs imagination, ranging from the theories of learned <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">academics</ENAMEX> to the ramblings of wild <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">eccentrics</ENAMEX>. By now the truth is surely lost in the myths and mists of time. What is undeniable, however, is the magical presence that these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> volcanic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sisters</ENAMEX> possess. When you sight <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mount Teide</ENAMEX> on a distant horizon you will understand the profusion of legends.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Inhabitants</ENAMEX>
Long before the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sailors</ENAMEX> beached in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canaries</ENAMEX>, all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> islands were inhabited. The original <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Canarians</ENAMEX> came to be called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guanches</ENAMEX>, meaning in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">native tongue ‚Äúman</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äù Strictly speaking</ENAMEX>, this name applies only to the original <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhabitants</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tenerife</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guanches</ENAMEX> are thought to have arrived in the islands around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1st</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2nd century</TIMEX> b.c., probably from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North Africa</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ethnographers</ENAMEX> link them with the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Cro-Magnon</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Proto-Mediterranean</ENAMEX> race. They were tall, light-skinned, often blue-eyed and blond-haired. You can see their remains in the meticulous collection of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museo Canario</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Las Palmas</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gran Canaria</ENAMEX>. Here too you can study their preoccupation with death. Like the ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Egyptians</ENAMEX> they carefully embalmed their dead, presumably for a ceremonial passage to the next world. Cryptic rock <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">carvings</ENAMEX> have been found that may explain these rituals, but so far no one has found the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canarian</ENAMEX> version of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rosetta Stone</ENAMEX> with which to decipher them.
Another baffling mystery is how the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guanches</ENAMEX> arrived on the islands. No evidence of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Guanche</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> has ever been discovered; so were they marooned here by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pirates</ENAMEX> or perhaps exiled by their own <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>? One theory is that they may have floated across from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North Africa</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">reed craft</ENAMEX>. The expeditions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thor Heyerdahl</ENAMEX> do lend some credence to this idea, and the concept is explored in great detail at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Pyramids of G√º√≠mar</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tenerife</ENAMEX>.
In keeping with their Berber origins the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guanches</ENAMEX> were cave <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dwellers</ENAMEX>, though by no means did all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Guanches</ENAMEX> live in the rocks, and many of the original caves that remain <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> (for example the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cuevas de Valer√≥n</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gran Canaria</ENAMEX>) were probably used only for storage. Cave <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dwelling</ENAMEX> in such a climate is a logical idea, being cooler in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> and warmer in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> than more conventional accommodations. Even <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, there are many <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cave dwellings</ENAMEX> in the islands.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guanche</ENAMEX> legacy that you will see at the market place and in traditional eating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> is gofio, a finely-ground, toasted flour that is still a traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canarian</ENAMEX> staple. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Guanche</ENAMEX> language also lives on in such place names as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tafira</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tamadaba</ENAMEX> (on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gran Canaria</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Timanfaya</ENAMEX> (on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lanzarote</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Teide</ENAMEX> (on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tenerife</ENAMEX>), and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tenerife</ENAMEX> itself.
Conquistadors
The first foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canaries</ENAMEX> are thought to have been <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sailors</ENAMEX> who landed on Gran Canaria <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 2,000</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX> and were met warmly. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later centuries the islanders‚</TIMEX>Äô gracious hospitality was to cost them dearly.
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Europeans</ENAMEX> did not arrive until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 14th century</TIMEX>, when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genoese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sailor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lanzarotto Marcello</ENAMEX> colonized the island, known then in native tongue as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tytheroygatra</ENAMEX> and subsequently as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lanzarote</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Slave traders</ENAMEX>, treasure <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">seekers</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">missionaries</ENAMEX> all followed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lanzarotto‚</ENAMEX>Äôs wake, but it was not until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1402</TIMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> conquest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canaries</ENAMEX> began in earnest. At its helm was the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norman baron</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jean de B√©thencourt</ENAMEX>, under service to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry III</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Castile</ENAMEX>. After the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baron</ENAMEX> had taken <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lanzarote</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fuerteventura</ENAMEX> with comparative ease, his <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX> were scattered by storms off <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gran Canaria</ENAMEX>. He next turned to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Hierro</ENAMEX>, where the awestruck <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">islanders</ENAMEX> welcomed the new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> arriving in their great floating <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX> as gods. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B√©thencourt</ENAMEX> returned the hospitality by inviting the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">natives</ENAMEX> aboard his <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX>. He then took them captive and sold them into slavery.
Around this time the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX>, who had also been colonizing the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX>, turned their attention to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canaries</ENAMEX>. Naval skirmishes ensued between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">powers</ENAMEX>, but at the end of the war of succession between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Castile</ENAMEX>, the wide-ranging <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Treaty of Alca√</ENAMEX>ßovas ended <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Lisbon‚</ENAMEX>Äôs claims to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fortunate Islands</ENAMEX>.
By order of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ferdinand</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isabella</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Castile</ENAMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> phase of the conquest was set in motion. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1483</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gran Canaria</ENAMEX> had been subdued and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1488</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gomera</ENAMEX> was taken. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">La Palma</ENAMEX> held out until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1493</TIMEX>, and after another <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</TIMEX> of furious fighting, the biggest prize of all, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tenerife</ENAMEX>, was in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> hands. The process of pacification and conversion to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> faith had taken <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">almost a century</TIMEX> of bloody guerilla warfare with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of casualties, sustained mainly on the brave but ill-equipped <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guanche</ENAMEX> side.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">World Is Round</ENAMEX>!
Just as the conquest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canaries</ENAMEX> was reaching its climax, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Christopher Columbus</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cristobal Col√≥n</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish</ENAMEX>) was planning his historic expedition in search of a sea route to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">East Indies</ENAMEX>. Each of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Canaries</ENAMEX> boasts some connection with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Columbus</ENAMEX>, who came to the islands because they were then the world‚Äôs most westerly charted points and therefore the last stopping point before venturing into the unknown.
The great <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">navigator</ENAMEX> definitely stopped off at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gomera</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Las Palmas</ENAMEX> on his voyage of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1492</TIMEX>, and he even recorded a volcanic eruption while passing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tenerife</ENAMEX>. Not surprisingly his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crew</ENAMEX> took this as an ill omen, but as history tells us, once past <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Hierro</ENAMEX> they did not drop off the edge of the world after all. Columbus‚Äôs routes and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Canarian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">connections</ENAMEX> may be traced at the atmospheric <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Casa de Col√≥n</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Palmas</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55</NUMEX>).
The role of the islands as a bridge between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Old World</ENAMEX> and the New World has continued through the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX>. Canarians have settled in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latin America</ENAMEX> in large numbers, usually in search of a better way of life, and news from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venezuela</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX> is treated almost as a local item in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canary Islands</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Canarian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bananas</ENAMEX> provided the stock for those of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carribbean</ENAMEX>, and in spoken accent and musical rhythms the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canaries</ENAMEX> lie halfway between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South America</ENAMEX>.
Wine and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warfare</ENAMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canaries‚Äô</ENAMEX> first major agricultural <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enterprise</ENAMEX> was <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sugar</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Sugar cane</ENAMEX> sprouted easily on the islands, and during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first half of the 16th century</TIMEX> a burgeoning industry developed. Boom turned to bust, however, with cheaper <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sugar</ENAMEX> production from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brazil</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Antilles</ENAMEX>, and the industry died.
Still, trade links had at least been established with both the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Old</ENAMEX> and the New World, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> became the new farming <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">venture</ENAMEX> to bolster the economy. Grapes grown in the volcanic soil produced a distinctive, full-bodied malmsey <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">malvas√≠a</ENAMEX>) that became the fashionable drink of aristocratic <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Voltaire</ENAMEX>, among others, were lavish in their praise, and today‚Äôs island <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> can still sample the excellent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bodegas</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, or even from the supermercado. When touring the islands you may still see old <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">disused wine</ENAMEX> presses (lagares) on hillsides.
By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the 18th century</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canaries</ENAMEX> were a sufficiently important trading point to attract all types of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pirates</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1797</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Horatio Nelson</ENAMEX> attacked <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Cruz de Tenerife</ENAMEX> in search of a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> treasure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ship</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defenders</ENAMEX> responded vigorously, accounting for the lives of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">226</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sailors</ENAMEX> and the removal of the lower part of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nelson‚</ENAMEX>Äôs saluting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Cruzeros</ENAMEX> clearly had no hard feelings towards <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Admiral Nelson</ENAMEX>, however. Once it was known that the attack had been repelled, a gift of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> was sent out to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nelson</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX> was, after all, an important wine market) and a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> was named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Calle de Horacio Nelson</ENAMEX> in his honor!
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Free Trade</ENAMEX>
By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 18th century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canarians</ENAMEX> had become fully <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> in both outlook and loyalties, and many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">volunteers</ENAMEX> joined the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Peninsular War</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spaniards</ENAMEX> call it the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">War</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Independence</ENAMEX>) which ended in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1814</TIMEX> with the restoration of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ferdinand</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">VII</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> throne.
Economic problems arose in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 19th century</TIMEX>, and the wine industry started to fail. Luckily another single-crop opportunity presented itself in the form of cochineal, a parasitic insect attracted to the opuntia variety of cactus. The tiny <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> of the female <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bugs</ENAMEX> contain a dark-red liquid perfect for dyeing, and for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50 years or so</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of bugs were crushed for the sake of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canarian</ENAMEX> economic good.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bug Bubble</ENAMEX> burst with the rise of chemical dyes in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1870s</TIMEX>. With the failure of yet another mono-culture, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> felt constrained to help the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canarian</ENAMEX> economy. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-19th century</TIMEX>, free <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port</ENAMEX> status was granted by royal decree to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX> in each of the islands (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tenerife</ENAMEX>). The lowering of duties and trade barriers at a time of considerable shipping expansion had the desired effect, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Cruz de Tenerife</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Palmas</ENAMEX> soon became <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of the world‚Äôs busiest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ports</ENAMEX>.
The most recent major <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crop</ENAMEX> to come from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canaries</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bananas</ENAMEX>. The variety is the dwarf <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">banana</ENAMEX>, small and very tasty, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> demand actually outstrips production in some areas. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> exports were made in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1880s</TIMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">banana</ENAMEX> has continued to be a mainstay of the islands‚Äô economy. Despite some recent problems and concern for the future, it is hoped that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bananas</ENAMEX> will continue to be an important <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canarian</ENAMEX> crop alongside their other staples; <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tomatoes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">potatoes</ENAMEX>.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1912</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cabildos</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Island Councils</ENAMEX>) were created and given the responsibility for the social, political and economic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> of each <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX>, and co-ordination with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Town Halls</ENAMEX>. This led, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1927</TIMEX>, to the islands being divided into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">provinces</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Cruz de Tenerife</ENAMEX> with the islands of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tenerife</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">La Palma</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">La Gomera</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Hierro</ENAMEX>; and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Las Palmas de Gran Canaria</ENAMEX> with the islands of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lanzarote</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fuerteventura</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Spanish Civil War</ENAMEX>
The plot that sparked off the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Spanish Civil War</ENAMEX> was hatched in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canary Islands</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1936</TIMEX> a group of senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX>, discontented with the policies of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Government</ENAMEX>, met in secret in the woods of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">La Esperanza on Tenerife</ENAMEX>. They had come to meet a fellow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francisco Franco</ENAMEX>, whom the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> had banished to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canaries</ENAMEX> for subversive plotting. From the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canaries</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Franco</ENAMEX> took off for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North Africa</ENAMEX>, the launching pad for the insurgent right-wing attack.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Three years later</TIMEX> his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">armies</ENAMEX> had triumphed in a ruthless struggle that cost <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds of thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> lives. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canaries</ENAMEX> were not spared the horrors of the war (mass <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> executions took place in the aptly named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barranco del Infierno</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gorge of Hell</ENAMEX>, on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tenerife</ENAMEX>), but on the whole the islands prospered during <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Franco‚Äôs</ENAMEX> period of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">dictatorship</ENAMEX>, which provided for added protection to their free-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port</ENAMEX> status.
Tourism
The massive growth of tourism in the islands since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s</TIMEX> has, in some cases, literally refaced the landscape, with brand-new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Playa de las Am√</ENAMEX>©ricas on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tenerife</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Playa del Ingl√</ENAMEX>©s on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gran Canaria</ENAMEX>, springing up like <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Gold Rush</ENAMEX> boom <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX>. However, such developments are mostly the exception and whole swathes of even the more developed islands are virtually untouched, while <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">La Palma</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">La Gomera</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Hierro</ENAMEX> are only now starting to provide even the most basic tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX>. The infrastructure and transport systems both within and between the islands have, as a consequence, improved drastically.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1972</TIMEX> the passing of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">R√©gimen Econ√≥mico y Fiscal</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Economic and Tax Regime</ENAMEX>) allowed for different methods of tax collection and economic management than that of the rest of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Three years later</TIMEX>, after the death of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Franco</ENAMEX>, a constitutional monarchy was restored with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Juan Carlos</ENAMEX> I at its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX>. However, the subsequent <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">de</ENAMEX>-colonization of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Spain‚Äôs Western Sahara</ENAMEX> possession resulted in a movement of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">many thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> back to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canary Islands</ENAMEX>, creating social and logistical problems. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">The year 1978</TIMEX> saw the declaration of a new <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Constitution</ENAMEX>, further strengthening the new democracy and preparing the ground for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Autonomous Regions</ENAMEX>. As a result, on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16 August 1982</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canary Islands</ENAMEX> were given autonomous status, with nearly all governmental functions transferred from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX> and the status of capital being shared between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Cruz de Tenerife</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Las Palmas de Gran Canaria</ENAMEX>.
