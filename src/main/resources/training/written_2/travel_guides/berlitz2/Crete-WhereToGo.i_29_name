Where to Go
C rete is a large <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX>, so if you want to see a lot of what it has to offer, choose your itinerary carefully. Staying at a central base allows excursions both east and west, but a base in the far east or west limits your ability to see the opposite side of the island. A lot of careful planning is recommended. 
This guide divides <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crete</ENAMEX> into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> sections: the capital, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ir√°klion</ENAMEX>, is <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>; followed by the central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">section</ENAMEX>; then moving east; before finally exploring the western parts of the island. We‚Äôll describe the major attractions so that you can plan your itinerary, though do remember that the countryside is filled with hidden treasures, traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX>, frescoed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX> and mountain <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">paths</ENAMEX>. All of these are waiting to be discovered.
Ir√°klion
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ir√°klion</ENAMEX> comes as a surprise to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">travelers</ENAMEX> used to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> islands further north in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Aegean Sea</ENAMEX>. It is a true city bustling with activity, dust, and noise. The commercial and administrative heart of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crete</ENAMEX>, its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> are filled with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bankers</ENAMEX> and business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. There is a lively young scene based around the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">university</ENAMEX>, and a sophistication to match other major <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thessalonica</ENAMEX>. However, this is not the only facet of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. Around the harbor you‚Äôll still find a fishing industry based on small family-owned <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX>, and small workshops in the narrow back <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> that still manufacture by hand. Though there are many modern <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>, these sit shoulder to shoulder with fine old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansions</ENAMEX> and are evidence of an older <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ir√°klion</ENAMEX>, which is fascinating to explore. Take time to see beyond the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> filled with traffic and you will be amply rewarded.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ir√°klion</ENAMEX> was a thriving port in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minoan</ENAMEX> times and became known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Herakleium</ENAMEX> under <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> rule. The arrival of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Venetians</ENAMEX> changed the town‚Äôs fortune. They chose it as their capital, bestowing the name <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Candia</ENAMEX> on both the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> and the whole island. Candia blossomed with the riches of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venetian</ENAMEX> trade, and when <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> stormed the island, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> held out for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several months</TIMEX> before falling into the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Moslem</ENAMEX> hands. It became a relative backwater of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottoman Empire</ENAMEX> only to rise to prominence again following <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">union</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX>. It was declared capital again in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1971</TIMEX>, taking the title from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chani√</ENAMEX>° in the west.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city center</ENAMEX> lies within the walls of a vast fortress started by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Venetians</ENAMEX> and reinforced by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turks</ENAMEX>. It is possible to walk along the walls, which seem to be swallowed up by the higher modern <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, to gain an impression of how large the citadel once was. The heart of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> is tiny <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Veniz√©los Square</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plate√≠a Veniz√©lou</ENAMEX>) with its fringe of caf√©s and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>. At its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Morosini Fountain</ENAMEX> dates from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venetian</ENAMEX> times, though the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">somber lion statues</ENAMEX> are <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three hundred years</TIMEX> older. Formerly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">waterspouts</ENAMEX>, these now stay dry. From this <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">square¬†‚Äî¬†known</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lion Square¬†‚Äî¬†most of Ir√</ENAMEX>°klion‚Äôs attractions are <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">only a few minutes‚</NUMEX>Äô walk. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South</ENAMEX>, on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25 August</TIMEX> Street (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Od√≥s 25 Avgoustou</ENAMEX>), you will see the impressive fa√ßade of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Venetian Loggia</ENAMEX>, originally dating from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1628</TIMEX> but reconstructed after a later earthquake. It now houses <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ir√°klion‚Äôs City Hall</ENAMEX>. Walk through the loggia to find the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Church of √Ågios T√≠tos.</ENAMEX> Founded at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the first millennium</TIMEX> it is named in honor of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">St.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Titus</ENAMEX>, the island‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patron saint</ENAMEX> who was charged by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. Paul</ENAMEX> to convert the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cretans</ENAMEX> to Christianity. When the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> was consecrated, his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> was laid to rest within the walls. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Venetians</ENAMEX> took his remains to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venice</ENAMEX> when they fled the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> was rebuilt as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX> after an earthquake in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1856</TIMEX>, giving the incongruous but beautiful decoration on the outer walls. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1966</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Venetian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> returned the skull of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">St.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Titus</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cretan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in a gold reliquary, along with fine paintings depicting scenes of the saint‚Äôs life. They are now on view inside. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Head</ENAMEX> across <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25 August</TIMEX> Street to a small <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">park¬†‚Äî¬†El Greco¬†‚Äî¬†named</ENAMEX> after the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painter</ENAMEX>, a native of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crete</ENAMEX>, whose true name was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dominicos Theotok√≥poulos</ENAMEX>. Here you can sit under the shade of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> away from the noise of the traffic.
Continuing along <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">25 August Street</ENAMEX> leads to the waterfront and the majestic sight of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Venetian</ENAMEX> fortress (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ko√∫les</ENAMEX>), built to protect the old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">harbor</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">You‚Äôll</ENAMEX> also see the vaulted remains of large arcaded asenali (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ship</ENAMEX> repair <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">yards</ENAMEX>) that serviced the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Venetian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">fleet</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fortress</ENAMEX> sits out on the breakwater and you will walk past the city‚Äôs fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">fleet</ENAMEX> to reach it. Small colorful <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> with piles of yellow nets are waiting to set sail for the next day‚Äôs catch. The fortress was completed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1540</TIMEX> to protect the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> against the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottoman</ENAMEX> threat. It proved a fine defense and was instrumental in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Candia‚</ENAMEX>Äôs ability to hold out so long in the siege of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1660s</TIMEX>. A tour of the interior reveals a strong and efficient design. There are panoramic views of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> and the surrounding countryside from its ramparts.
A short walk west along the waterfront brings you to the remains of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dominican Monastery of √Åyios P√©tros</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">St. Peter</ENAMEX>), which is in the process of renovation, and beyond that is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Historical Museum of Crete</ENAMEX>, housed in a remarkable building¬<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">†‚Äî¬†part</ENAMEX> Venetian <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansion</ENAMEX> and part modern <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glass edifice</ENAMEX>. This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> concentrates on <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cretan</ENAMEX> history from the fall of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roman Empire</ENAMEX> to the present day. There are exquisite icons and other religious paintings rescued from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX> across the island, fine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stone carvings</ENAMEX>, and examples of textiles and embroidery in a re-creation of a traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cretan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX>. Models and prints of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ir√</ENAMEX>°klion through the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX> show how the cityscape has developed. The struggle for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cretan</ENAMEX> independence is given a prominent position in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>, as is the only painting by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">El Greco</ENAMEX> still on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crete</ENAMEX>. 
Immediately north of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Veniz√©los Square</ENAMEX> you‚Äôll reach <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1866</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Street</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Od√≥s 1866</ENAMEX>), also known as <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Market Street</ENAMEX>, which still has the atmosphere of an old <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bazaar</ENAMEX>. Here you‚Äôll be able to stroll past <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stalls</ENAMEX> selling fresh produce and souvenirs, or eat at the numerous small ouzeries that serve the market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>. At the southern end of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Market Street</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Korn√°rou Square</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plate√≠a Korn√°rou</ENAMEX>) where you will find the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bembo Fountain</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kr√≠ni Bembo</ENAMEX>) created in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16th century</TIMEX> using numerous pieces of architectural <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">salvage¬</ENAMEX>†‚Äî¬†including the fine torso of a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greco</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> statue.
A short walk from here to the left along the inner arterial road brings you to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">St. Catherine‚Äôs Square</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plate√≠a Ag√≠as Ekater√≠nis</ENAMEX>) where <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Cathedral of √Åghios Min√</ENAMEX>°s dwarfs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> older religious <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>. The small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> immediately next to it is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Church of √Åghios Min√°s</ENAMEX>, which has a splendid ornate iconostasis¬†‚Äî¬†if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> is closed ask in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">cathedral</ENAMEX> as the custodian here has the key. Behind these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX> is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 15th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">place</ENAMEX> of worship that gives the square its name; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Church of St. Catherine</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ag√≠a Ekater√≠ni</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> originally belonged to the religious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Catherine‚Äôs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monastery</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sinai</ENAMEX> (now part of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX>), and it acted as a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> of learning. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> it houses the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum of Icons</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sacred Objects¬†‚Äî¬†a</ENAMEX> wealth of art from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX> and monasteries across the island, including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> large icons by celebrated <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Cretan artist Mikha√≠l Damaskin√≥s</ENAMEX>.
Walk west from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lion Square</ENAMEX> along the pedestrian <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dhedh√°lou</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Od√≥s Dhedh√°lou</ENAMEX>) to reach the major attraction in the city¬†‚Äî¬†the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Archaeological Museum</ENAMEX>. From <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dhedh√</ENAMEX>°lou run a number of small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">alleys</ENAMEX> with up-market caf√©s and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> where you‚Äôll find <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ir√°klion‚Äôs</ENAMEX> young and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">affluent</ENAMEX> enjoying iced <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX> and a game of backgammon. There are some good <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> here serving fine <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> and international cuisine.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Archaeological Museum of Ir√</ENAMEX>°klion is without a doubt <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the greatest archaeological collections in the world. It brings together finds from sites all across the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> and from every era of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crete‚</ENAMEX>Äôs long ancient history, shedding light on the everyday activities of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. Pride of place has to go to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Minoan</ENAMEX> artifacts. As the pre-eminent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">center</ENAMEX> of this ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crete</ENAMEX> is the main source of information and excavated remains.

For most other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX> this would be treasure enough, yet in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ir√</ENAMEX>°klion there are also impressive <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> artifacts to enjoy. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> is a must for those intending to visit the ancient sites, since the objects here add life to the now empty <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palaces</ENAMEX>. 
To fully appreciate all of its glories will take <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least a couple of hours¬</TIMEX>†‚Äî¬†the exquisite detail in painting on pottery and frescoes, and the fine workmanship in jewelry and everyday tools is breathtaking.

<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Room 5</ENAMEX> holds objects from the final phase of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Minoan</ENAMEX> civilization (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1450‚Äì1400 b.c.</ENAMEX>). The pottery and stone work is worth studying, however the chief artifacts are the script fragments of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Linear</ENAMEX> A type scribed on thin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">clay plates</ENAMEX> and not yet deciphered. Also exhibited are examples of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Linear</ENAMEX> B type, which was deciphered in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1952</TIMEX> and is of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mycenaean</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">origin¬†‚Äî¬†showing</ENAMEX> that by the time the tablet was written the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Minoans</ENAMEX> had lost control of the major <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Room 6</ENAMEX> concentrates on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tomb</ENAMEX> finds dating from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">New-Palace</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post-Palace</ENAMEX> periods and displays beautiful pottery pieces, military pieces such as helmets and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">sword</ENAMEX> handles, and gold jewelry.

However, the highlight of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> is case <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">101</TIMEX>, which displays gold jewelry of exquisite detail. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bee pendant</ENAMEX> found near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">M√</ENAMEX>°lia is one of the most recognizable Minoan artifacts; others include representations of the labrys¬†‚Äî the double<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">-axed sword</ENAMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central Crete</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central Crete</ENAMEX> is the market garden of the island with fertile <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">valleys</ENAMEX> sitting between rocky mountain ranges. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> it supplies much of the fresh produce for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> including <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">tons</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">grapes</ENAMEX> for the quaffable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cretan</ENAMEX> country <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX>. This is not a recent development; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Minoans</ENAMEX> made it home, with their most famous palace <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only a few kilometers</NUMEX> away from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ir√°klion.</ENAMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> capital was also located in this region. Around these important archaeological <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> are farming communities quite different in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> and the coastal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX>. Spend a little time exploring these <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> for a glimpse of a lifestyle that will soon disappear as the younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> turns its back on a rural way of life.
Knoss√≥s
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Five</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kilometers</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 miles</NUMEX>) directly south of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ir√</ENAMEX>°klion is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Knoss√≥s</ENAMEX>, now famed worldwide as the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> where Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arthur Evans</ENAMEX> (then <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ashmolean Museum</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxford</ENAMEX>) found proof that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cretan</ENAMEX> civilization of myth had been based on reality. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Evans</ENAMEX> named them the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Minoans</ENAMEX> after their most famous <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">king¬†‚Äî¬†Minos</ENAMEX>. He began digging in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1900</TIMEX> after buying the site and financing the excavation program with his own money, and almost immediately struck the first building blocks of a huge Bronze Age palace replete with magnificent pottery and other artifacts. Evans‚Äô subsequent attempts to recreate areas of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> have met with intense criticism from other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX> but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Knoss√≥s</ENAMEX> is now <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crete‚</ENAMEX>Äôs premier attraction and rightly so. Though there is no documented proof, most <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cretans</ENAMEX> believe that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Knoss√≥s</ENAMEX> was the site of the famed battle between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Theseus</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Minotaur</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Labryinth</ENAMEX> below <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Minos‚Äô</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX>. You may wish you had a ball of golden thread as you explore the maze of small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> here, as it is very difficult to follow the map provided. It also becomes very busy in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the middle of the day</TIMEX> so arrive early if you want to contemplate the site with few distractions.
The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Knoss√≥s</ENAMEX> was built around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> b.c. in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Old Palace</ENAMEX> era, but this was destroyed by a massive earthquake <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">only 300 years later</TIMEX>. Most of the remains seen at the site <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> constitute the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> built following the disaster which also coincided with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golden Age</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Minoan</ENAMEX> society or the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">New Palace era¬†‚Äî¬†1700</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">b.c.</ENAMEX>, when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> were rich through trade, and artistic endeavor was at its peak. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> grew continuously through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the following years</TIMEX> resulting in a complex of around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1200</TIMEX> small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> several stories high covering <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">over 20,000 sq m</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">215,278 sq ft</NUMEX>). The construction was immensely complicated with light <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wells illuminating lower chambers</ENAMEX> and polythyra, masonry supports to create structural integrity, between which were large wooden doors serving as partitions.
The golden era came to an end in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1450</TIMEX> b.c. and major fire caused catastrophic damage around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1350</TIMEX> b.c., but though the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> was completely destroyed the site continued to be occupied until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 5th century</TIMEX> a.d. 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> was erected around a large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central Court</ENAMEX>, used for public meetings, which now forms the heart of the site. Imagine <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minoans</ENAMEX> at play here as depicted on the pottery and frescoes in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Archaeological Museum</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Ir√°klion‚ÄÇ‚Äî¬†acrobats</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dancers</ENAMEX> as well as the famed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bull leapers</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Visitors</ENAMEX> enter past what remains of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">West Court</ENAMEX> used as an entryway to a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">West Wing</ENAMEX>, where the administrative and religious activities took place. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Minoans</ENAMEX> would walk down the corridor of processions past frescoed walls to reach the propylaia (sacred entranceway). A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grand Staircase</ENAMEX> then led north to the most important official <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chambers</ENAMEX> within this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX>, its sturdy painted colonnades typical of those found throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX>. The lower floor here houses the throne <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ornate griffin frescoes</ENAMEX> and a lustral basin for ritual purification. The gypsum throne is the oldest in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> and traces of paint show that it would have been brightly colored when in use. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">walls¬†‚Äî¬†lined</ENAMEX> with stone seats thought to have been used by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisers</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">councilors¬†‚Äî¬†would</ENAMEX> have been decorated with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">red plaster</ENAMEX> and an ornamental dado. In the northeastern corner was a crypt where a cache of treasures was unearthed during the excavations.
A staircase by the throne room leads to what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Evans</ENAMEX> christened the piano nobile¬†‚Äî¬†an upper floor of the west wing. Next to the staircase is the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Tripartite Shrine</ENAMEX> where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Linear</ENAMEX> B alphabetical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tablets</ENAMEX> were discovered. 
On the east side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX>, a grand staircase leads to the royal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chambers</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Megara</ENAMEX>, where some of the best preserved <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> can be found. <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Notice the</ENAMEX> clever use of lighting wells to illuminate the lowest stories (there were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> altogether). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">King‚Äôs Megaron</ENAMEX> is decorated with a simple wooden throne, though the antechamber walls are incised with images of the double axe or labrys, so important to the mythology surrounding <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Knoss√≥s</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> is also known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hall of the Double Axes</ENAMEX>. The architecture of this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> is typically <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">New Palace</ENAMEX> style with large polythyra supporting the roof. It is thought that large wooden doors were fitted between the pillars and that these could be removed to create a stoa (open fronted arcade) if the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">King</ENAMEX> wished it. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Queen‚Äôs Megaron</ENAMEX> has a splendid dolphin fresco lining one wall. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Evans</ENAMEX> made numerous remarkable finds at the site, since it had been covered and left undisturbed following the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">1350 b.c.</ENAMEX> disaster. Pottery intricately painted with marine life, bronze figurines, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">exquisite jewels¬†‚Äî¬†many</ENAMEX> of these were discovered in the rock cut tombs of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palace</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Period¬†‚Äî¬†yet</ENAMEX> it is the mundane and simple things which make <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Knoss√≥s</ENAMEX> so fascinating. Evidence of early water piping, central heating, and sanitation shows a remarkable <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sophistication¬†‚Äî¬†look</ENAMEX> for the toilet <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> next to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Queens</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX> for evidence of a flushing system! Continue past the remains of a hypostyle hall which was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Customs House</ENAMEX> to the start of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Road</ENAMEX> leading north to the coast, still in exceptional condition and far better than most thoroughfares on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crete</ENAMEX> until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">only a few years ago</TIMEX>.
On the road to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Knoss√≥s</ENAMEX>, look for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Natural History Museum of Crete¬†‚Äî¬†an</ENAMEX> often overlooked attraction but worthwhile for those who enjoy geology, <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flora</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">fauna</ENAMEX>. Exhibits concentrate on <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">endemic species</ENAMEX> and the diverse environments that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crete</ENAMEX> has to offer. It also examines man‚Äôs effect on the island from his earliest arrival to the present day.
Other classical sites lay below <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Ir√°klion</ENAMEX> near the south coast. Take the road to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ag√≠a Vav√°ra</ENAMEX>, in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">vine</ENAMEX>-filled valley skirting the looming mountains of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ida</ENAMEX> range to the west. Here you‚Äôll find the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Messar√° Plain</ENAMEX>, a wide fertile valley surrounded by hills, which has been a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> for farming since ancient times. For a pretty drive along the upper reaches of the valley, take the road to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zar√≥s</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ag√≠a Vav√°ra.</ENAMEX> The scenery is magnificent and you can visit <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Mon√≠ Vrontis√≠</ENAMEX>, a small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monastery</ENAMEX> in the hills above the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, which was the original home of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Damaskin√≥s icons¬†‚Äî¬†now</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Ag√≠a Ekater√</ENAMEX>≠nis in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ir√°klion.</ENAMEX> This road leads through the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kam√°res</ENAMEX> where there is a large cave, and links up with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Amari Valley</ENAMEX> to the west (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">62</NUMEX>).
To reach the ancient sites drop down from <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Ag√≠a Vav√°ra on to the Plain</ENAMEX>. Near the village of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Ag√≠a D√©ka¬†‚Äî¬†named</ENAMEX> after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">saints</ENAMEX> who were martyred here¬†‚Äî¬†and widely scattered in farmland, are the remains of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G√≥rtis</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gortyn</ENAMEX>), capital of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> during the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> era (from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">65 b.c.</NUMEX>) and also an important <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minoan</ENAMEX> times.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G√≥rtis</ENAMEX> is such a huge site¬†‚Äî¬†at its height it had a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">300,000¬†‚Äî¬</NUMEX>†that you will see signposts to remains lying in the midst of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crops</ENAMEX> south of the modern <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>. By all means, stop to enjoy them, or leave the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> and walk around. You‚Äôll be well-rewarded, with ancient columns resting against olive <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>, shards of pottery among the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">grass blades</ENAMEX>, and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Governor‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> and amphitheatre to explore. Stop at the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Byzantine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">village¬†‚Äî¬†you‚Äôll find stone</ENAMEX> from the ancient site used here too¬<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">†‚Äî¬†and</ENAMEX> see the stone execution block of the martyrs. Their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tomb</ENAMEX> can be viewed through the gate of a nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">crypt</ENAMEX>.
The main site (the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> with the admission fee) covers only a tiny part of the whole, but it protects one of the most important archaeological finds on the island¬<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">†‚Äî¬†the Code</ENAMEX> of Laws dating from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dorian</ENAMEX> period, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">around 500</NUMEX> b.c. The huge stone <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tablet</ENAMEX> was incised with script dictating codes governing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> life including rules on marriage, property, and inheritance rights. The remains of a small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">theater</ENAMEX> lie just in front of the code area, and the site entrance is dominated by the apse of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 6th century</TIMEX> basilica of √Ågios <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T√≠tos</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Titus</ENAMEX>). The remains of the saint were originally interred here but were moved to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ir√°klion</ENAMEX> following <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> raids which destroyed the rest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">825</NUMEX>.
Travel on through the village of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mires</ENAMEX> to reach <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Phaist√≥s</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fest√≥s</ENAMEX>), site of an impressive <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Minoan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX>. As <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G√≥rtis</ENAMEX> rose in prominence towards <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the first millennium b.c.</TIMEX>, the fortunes of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phaist√≥s</ENAMEX> declined, though it had been the seat of power for most of southern <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crete</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minoan</ENAMEX> times.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phaist√≥s</ENAMEX> is probably the most dramatic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Minoan</ENAMEX> site on the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX>. Its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> is set atop a rocky knoll with <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> cascading down the hillside. There are dramatic views out across the plains to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ida Mountains</ENAMEX> in the north and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Astero√</ENAMEX>∫ssia range in the east. It is said that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Minos</ENAMEX> installed his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rhadamanthys</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ruler</ENAMEX> here. He was known as a wise and honest man consulted by many as an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">arbitrator</ENAMEX>.
The layout of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> is similar to that of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Knoss√≥s</ENAMEX>, though the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">remains</ENAMEX> are more confusing, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> successive <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">palaces‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇtwo</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Old Palace</ENAMEX> era and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">New Palace</ENAMEX> era¬†‚Äî¬†on show here. You enter the site down a flight of steps and find yourself in the west <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX>. The remains in the foreground are those of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Old Palace</ENAMEX>, which stand proudly in front of the walls of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">New Palace</ENAMEX> behind. You‚Äôll see scant remains of a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrine</ENAMEX> and early propylon. Above the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrine</ENAMEX> is a grand stairway leading to the propylaeum, the grand entryway into the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">New Palace</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">west wing¬†‚Äî¬†as</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Knoss√≥s¬†‚Äî¬†was</ENAMEX> chiefly made up of shrines and storerooms and many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX> of ritual were found during excavations here. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">You‚Äôll</ENAMEX> find that some <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> still house their lustral bowls for ritual purification. A path to your right leads down some steps and through a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> to the central <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX>; from here you can get your bearings.
Walk to the north <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> where you enter the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">royal chambers¬†‚Äî¬†two giant p√≠thoi</ENAMEX> (large earthenware pots) guard the entryway from the central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">You‚Äôll</ENAMEX> find a peristyle <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX> here and steps leading down to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">King‚Äôs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Queen‚Äôs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">chambers¬†‚Äî¬†both</ENAMEX> built to make the most of the cooling updrafts of the hillside. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">east</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> was mainly used for practical activities, as there are remnants of a furnace and workshops <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">here¬†‚Äî¬†perhaps</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">copper smelting</ENAMEX>. They would have supplied the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> with its need for ceremonial or funerary articles.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phaist√≥s</ENAMEX> disc was discovered here in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1903</TIMEX> but not in any of the important <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Palatial-</ENAMEX>era <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX>. It was discovered by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workmen</ENAMEX> on the northern edge of the site in a tiny clay walled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX>. The disc, said to date from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1700</TIMEX> b.c., is covered with a spiral pattern of symbols and geometric forms that have yet to be deciphered. You can see the original in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Archaeological Museum</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ir√°klion</ENAMEX>; or buy a copy at any souvenir <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX>.
Just <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 miles</NUMEX>) from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phaist√≥s</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Ag√≠a Tri√</ENAMEX>°da, built, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">archaeologists</ENAMEX> believe, as a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> palace for the royal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> and linked to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minoan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>. Set on a hillside overlooking the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gulf of Messar√</ENAMEX>° it offered excellent views and cooling sea breezes as the sea came much closer in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">those days</TIMEX>. The remains indicate a series of blocks of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> that could work as a whole or could operate individually if needed. Perhaps this was to accommodate different sizes of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">entourage</ENAMEX> at different times. The west <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX> of the palace housed the royal quarters. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ag√≠a Tri√°da</ENAMEX> was built late in the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Minoan</ENAMEX> era, around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1700</TIMEX> b.c. and though it suffered great damage in the cataclysm of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1450</TIMEX> b.c., it was reoccupied, and a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dorian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> was built nearby. Since this was famed in its time for several <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrines</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX> have debated that the original <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> may have had some religious purpose. Numerous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tombs</ENAMEX> have been excavated on the hillside, and the sarcophagi in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ir√</ENAMEX>°klion <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>, finely decorated with cult scenes, was found here. Atop the whole site is the incongruous √Ågios <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ge√≥rgios</ENAMEX>, a pretty whitewashed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>.
If by now you are in need of some rest and refreshment make your way to the coastal <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M√</ENAMEX>°tala just a little way south of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phaist√≥s</ENAMEX>. Here you‚Äôll find a good sandy bay lined with tavernas, and you can enjoy a re-energizing lunch or cool dip. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX> are well-regarded by snorkelers and there are fascinating remains of a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port</ENAMEX> under <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only a few feet</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>. On the northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">side</ENAMEX> are high sandstone cliffs where you will find many large <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> tombs cut into the rock. Until recently they were unprotected and used as free camping spots by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">travelers</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> they are fenced and guarded, though for a small fee you can still explore these fascinating man-made caves.
Another good spot for lunch is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">V√≥ri</ENAMEX> just north of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phaist√≥s</ENAMEX>. This traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> has a small central <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> with shady <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> and a couple of tavernas. Take a look at the small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Folklore Museum</ENAMEX> near the village <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX>.
Traveling west from the archaeological sites you‚Äôll reach the coastal <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ag√≠a Gal√≠ni</ENAMEX>, its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> tumbling down a hill to a tiny <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port</ENAMEX> from which you can take trips along the coast. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">North</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Ag√≠a Gal√</ENAMEX>≠ni the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> leads to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">R√©thymnon</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">56</NUMEX>).
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Central Mountains</ENAMEX>
Heading west out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ir√</ENAMEX>°klion you can take the fast road (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New National Road</ENAMEX>) along the coast, with easy links to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ag√≠a Pel√°gia</ENAMEX> (with organized watersports), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bali</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P√°normos</ENAMEX>, or take the slower <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Old National Road</ENAMEX>, which winds its way inland. Taking this road allows you to explore some of the most rugged and interesting landscape in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crete</ENAMEX>, and leads you back to the time of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> mythology, when the gods ruled the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">earth</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ida Mountains</ENAMEX> (also known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Psilor√</ENAMEX>≠tis range) dominate central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crete</ENAMEX>, rising steeply from the coastal plain and crowned by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mount Ida</ENAMEX> itself, measuring a distinguished <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2,456 m</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">8,058 ft</NUMEX>). In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> they seem almost to touch the clear azure sky; in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> they attract a mantle of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">snow</ENAMEX> and swathes of thick menacing clouds, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> of their lower slopes seem to hang suspended on this grey swirling blanket. 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> of this region have been some of the most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stalwart</ENAMEX> against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crete‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enemies</ENAMEX>, and subject to some of their worst reprisals. One such <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">An√≥gia</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> suffered two bloody beatings under the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turks</ENAMEX> when the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> was razed to the ground, and again in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WWII</ENAMEX>. When <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cretan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partisans</ENAMEX> kidnapped <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Kreipe</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of the occupying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> on the island, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Germans</ENAMEX> unleashed a terrible reprisal here. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Soldiers</ENAMEX> marched into the village killing all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and razing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> to the ground. Several monuments in the village commemorate the sad events. Through happier times the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> has built a reputation for weaving and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">embroidery¬†‚Äî¬†still</ENAMEX> sold in the lower town¬†‚Äî¬†as well as for its lyre <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX>, and this is one place where you are sure to see <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> in their traditional costume of high leather boots, britches, and headdress. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">An√≥gia</ENAMEX> is the main point of entry to the higher mountains. Follow the road out of the top of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> and inexorably upward to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">N√≠da Plateau</ENAMEX>, a land once only visited by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shepherds</ENAMEX> tending their flocks. Continue through the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">barren wastes</ENAMEX> until you reach the tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pavilion</ENAMEX>, where you can stock up on necessities such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">snacks</ENAMEX>. There is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX> here and a ski <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> nearby showing just how much times have changed. Beyond the hotel the road leads on to the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Idaean Cave</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Id√©on Antron</ENAMEX>) where it is said that <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Zeus¬†‚Äî¬†the god</ENAMEX> of all <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> gods¬†‚Äî¬†spent his childhood, protected from his father <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kronos</ENAMEX> by fierce <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">warriors</ENAMEX>, the kouretes. Though the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cave</ENAMEX> itself is not impressive by Cretan standards, it held a powerful sway over its ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. It is even said that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Minos</ENAMEX> himself would travel here <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every nine years</TIMEX> to receive new laws from above. Archaeologists have found votive offerings dating back over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3,000 years</TIMEX>, attesting to the ancient power of the site.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Climbing Mount Ida</ENAMEX> takes <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">around nine hours</TIMEX> roundtrip from this point. It is advisable to take a guide and inquiring in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">An√≥gia</ENAMEX> should help you find one.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eastern Crete</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eastern Crete</ENAMEX> is a fascinating amalgam of landscapes. Some of the longest established resorts expand along the northern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">coast</ENAMEX> while the interior has verdant valleys dividing mountain ranges that were until very recently remote. Here it is still possible to explore the traditional rural lifestyle once omnipresent in the interior of the island. Cave systems and ancient sites add to the attractions, and make the east a good location for a combination beach/excursion vacation.
Heading out from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ir√</ENAMEX>°klion you‚Äôll pass the airport <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 miles</NUMEX>) away before reaching the beginning of the coastal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">strip</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">New National</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> takes you swiftly along, so if you want to explore take the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Old National</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>. Your pace will be slower but you‚Äôll see more. This part of the northern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">coast</ENAMEX> was the main area of development during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1970s and 80s</TIMEX>, and it is not to everyone‚Äôs taste. Large concrete <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> and apartment <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> line the strip, and it‚Äôs a home away from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> for many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nationals</ENAMEX>, with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> menus, satellite <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">football</ENAMEX>, and all the favorite northern <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> TV programs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">It‚Äôs</ENAMEX> almost impossible to believe that you are on a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX>. However, if you want almost non-stop fun, then this is the place for you. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Water-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX>, go-carting, bungy-jumping, bars and nightclubs¬†‚Äî¬†its all here! 
The development reaches a peak at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Limin Hers√≥nissos</ENAMEX>, though the inland village of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ano Hers√≥nissos</ENAMEX> still has vestiges of its old <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">atmosphere¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†and some good tavernas. Once past the good beaches of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M√</ENAMEX>°lia it peters out, and has completely given way to farmland by the time you reach the site of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Minoan Palace of M√°lia</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3/4 mile</NUMEX>) to the east.
Remains under and around the palace show <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Neolithic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">settlements</ENAMEX>, though the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> was built after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">b.c.‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇlater</ENAMEX> than <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Knoss√≥s and Phaist√≥s¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†and it revealed no <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Kam√°resware</ENAMEX> pottery from the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Pre-Palatial</ENAMEX> period like that found at the other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palaces</ENAMEX>. Its design is also simpler with no large <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">halls</ENAMEX> or fine wall decorations. This <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> was destroyed by the earthquake c1700 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">b.c.</ENAMEX> and there are scant remains of it left in the northwest of the site. The new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> centered on an open <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX> with a west wing mainly consisting of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazines</ENAMEX> (storerooms) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cult rooms</ENAMEX>. A loggia fronted the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> on this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX>. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> of this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX> a p√≠thoi was found with a ceremonial dagger inside, alongside this lay a sword decorated with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX> and crystal leading <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX> to conclude that this was a preparation or contemplation room for the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">King</ENAMEX>. Up a nearby flight of stairs is an altar <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> with the base of its altar table still in situ. Further west a polythron area with paved <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX> is thought to have been the royal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartments</ENAMEX>. Hieroglyphic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">clay tablets</ENAMEX> and official seals were found here. Just a little way north of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace site</ENAMEX> is the chrys√≥lakkas or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äòpit of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX>,‚Äô where the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äògolden bee‚Äô pendant</ENAMEX> was discovered among a greater cache of jewels.
Soon after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M√°lia Palace</ENAMEX> the road turns inland past the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ne√°polis</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">birthplace</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P√©tros Ph√</ENAMEX>≠largos who became <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pope Alexander V</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1409</TIMEX>. This is the only place on the island were you can try soum√°da, a sweet <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drink</ENAMEX> made from almonds. Look for the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Chapel of √Åghios Ge√≥rghios Sel√≠naris</ENAMEX> on your right as you go up through the mountain pass. This <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrine</ENAMEX> to safe passage along the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> was once set high above the old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> and was only accessible up a narrow rocky path. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> it stands beside the new fast road and its prayers are perhaps most needed by those trying to cross from the opposite side to visit it.
Eventually the road meets the coast at √Ågios <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nik√≥laos</ENAMEX>, probably the prettiest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> in eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crete</ENAMEX>. Though √Ågios <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Nik√≥laos¬†‚Äî¬†known</ENAMEX> to everyone as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ag</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Nik¬†‚Äî¬†suffered</ENAMEX> from a sudden rush of ugly <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1970s</TIMEX> and has a young and noisy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX>, it has made a concerted effort to keep its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> and offers a more <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> atmosphere than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M√°lia/Hers√≥nissos</ENAMEX> strip.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> sits on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gulf of Mirab√</ENAMEX>©llo blanketing low hills which rise up from the shoreline. At the center of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Lake Voulism√©ni</ENAMEX>, a deep freshwater spring-fed lake where a plethora of pretty fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> are tied. Numerous caf√©s and tavernas line the north and eastern edges of the lake and you can sit and watch the kingfishers swoop for minnows or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">divers descend</ENAMEX> to the blue/green depths. The south and west sides of the lake are flanked by sheer rock faces and you can climb the steps to the top for superb views over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">town¬†‚Äî¬†perfect</ENAMEX> at sunset!
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lake Voulism√©ni</ENAMEX> is connected to the sea by an artificial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX>. Across the road <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX> at its mouth is the main tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>, and beyond are the harbor and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sea</ENAMEX> breezes here often make this stroll cooler than around the lake. From the port you can take ca√Øque (small colorful wooden <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX>) trips to nearby attractions, most notably <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spinal√≥nga Island</ENAMEX>.
You won‚Äôt be able to explore <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">√Ågios Nik√≥laos</ENAMEX> without walking up a few hills. There are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> selling up-market goods such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">leather</ENAMEX> and fur coats around the harborside and along <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Od√≥s Skafian√°ki</ENAMEX>, to the west of the harborfront. Or take <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Od√≥s Koundo√</ENAMEX>∫rou to <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Plate√≠a Veniz√</ENAMEX>©los for more typical Cretan souvenirs like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">honey</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ceramics</ENAMEX>. 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Archaeological Museum</ENAMEX> found at the top of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Od√≥s K. Pale√≥logou</ENAMEX> is worth a visit. It has a good collection of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Minoan</ENAMEX> artifacts presented in chronological order. You will be able to view a sarcophagus with skeleton still in place, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Goddess of M√≠rtos</ENAMEX>, a libation <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessel</ENAMEX> dating from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 2nd millennium</TIMEX> b.c. in the shape of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> with a long neck and squat <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>. A later <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> find is the skull of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Potam√≥s</ENAMEX>, decorated with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crown</ENAMEX> of gold olive <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">leaves</ENAMEX>. The coin nearby was found between the skull‚Äôs teeth and thought to be the dead man‚Äôs fare for the ferryboat across the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">River Styx</ENAMEX> to the underworld.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">√Ågios Nik√≥laos</ENAMEX> does not have great beaches; as a consequence much of its up-market accommodations are outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Head</ENAMEX> north and you‚Äôll find some of the best accommodations in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> with a cluster of luxury <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Elo√∫nda.</ENAMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> itself is understated, with a pretty church on the waterfront. You can also head to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spinal√≥nga</ENAMEX> from here¬†‚Äî¬†a much shorter trip than from √Ågios <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nik√≥laos</ENAMEX> because the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> lies just offshore. Its lower section is linked to the mainland by a narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX>. Or you can head even further north on the main <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> to the tiny coastal <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pl√°ka</ENAMEX> and take a rowboat ferry to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spinal√≥nga</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">You‚Äôll</ENAMEX> find a number of excellent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">seafood tavernas</ENAMEX> here for an alfresco lunch after your visit.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spinal√≥nga Island</ENAMEX> has been settled since ancient times. In the shallows off its southern tip are the remains of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greco</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of √ìlous and just beyond the bridge a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">a.d. mosaic</ENAMEX> within the foundations of an early <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">basilica</ENAMEX>. But it is the north of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> that attracts most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>. Here, on a small rocky <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sub-islet</ENAMEX> are the remains of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Venetian</ENAMEX> stronghold of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spinal√≥nga</ENAMEX>, built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1579</TIMEX> to protect the entrance to this sheltered bay. Its strong bastions and high ‚Äòcurtains‚Äô were never taken by an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enemy</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venetian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garrison</ENAMEX> remained here until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1715</TIMEX>, over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60 years</TIMEX> after the fall of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ir√°klion</ENAMEX>, and only left after a treaty gave them safe passage. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turks</ENAMEX> in turn retreated to the island when they came under threat from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cretan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rebels</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the 19th century</TIMEX>. At <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the beginning of the 20th century</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cretan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">council</ENAMEX> decided to open a leper <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX>; whether this was an attempt to force the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turks</ENAMEX> to leave is open to debate but the disease was rampant on the main <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Spinal√≥nga‚Äôs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">position¬†‚Äî¬†offshore</ENAMEX> yet not too remote¬†‚Äî¬†was considered ideal for study of the disease and a quarantine for its sufferers. Initially, the regime was harsh, with fear and ignorance causing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> to be treated more like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">criminals</ENAMEX> than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>; however, conditions improved over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</TIMEX> until the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX> was disbanded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1957</TIMEX>. Wandering among the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">remains</ENAMEX> lends poignancy to your exploration. This history was made within the lifetime of many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>. 
Inland from √Ågios <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nik√≥laos</ENAMEX> are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> attractions that make an enjoyable <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning or afternoon</TIMEX> sightseeing. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Head</ENAMEX> out towards the village of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Krits√</ENAMEX>° <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">12 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">7 miles</NUMEX>) from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>. Before you reach the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> itself you‚Äôll find a beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Byzantine chapel</ENAMEX> on your right. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Panag√≠a Ker√°</ENAMEX> was built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 13th century</TIMEX> and decorated with superb frescoes of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 14th and 15th centuries</TIMEX>. You‚Äôll need time to take in every detail of the interior and the simple lines of the exterior.
Resume your journey toward <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Krits√°</ENAMEX>, but don‚Äôt visit the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> yet. Follow signs to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lat√≥</ENAMEX>, the remains of a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dorian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">7th‚Äì3rd centuries b.c.</ENAMEX>) scattered around <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> scrub-covered hilltops to the north. The blocks of strong <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stone don‚</ENAMEX>Äôt come close to rivaling the fine fresco-covered walls of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Minoan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">settlements</ENAMEX>, yet there is a satisfaction in both location and form when you climb among the remains of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lat√≥</ENAMEX>. There are also wonderful views down to the coast from here.
Finally you can allow yourself to head into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Krits√°</ENAMEX>, perhaps to take some well-earned refreshment. This ‚Äòtraditional‚Äô <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> is perhaps overly touristy for some but it is still very much lived-in and extremely well-kept, with brilliant whitewashed walls accented by brightly painted windowframes and charming potted <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">You‚Äôll</ENAMEX> find good tavernas around the old <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">village square¬†‚Äî¬†look</ENAMEX> for the huge plane <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>. Always famed for its carpet weaving and textiles, you‚Äôll see examples hanging from walls and shop doorways in the narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>. There is a full range of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cretan</ENAMEX> handicrafts and traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foodstuffs</ENAMEX> to choose from, making <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Krits√</ENAMEX>° a good place to do your souvenir shopping.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Las√≠thi Plain</ENAMEX>
While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Krits√</ENAMEX>° is a good example of the modern development of traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cretan</ENAMEX> lifestyle, you won‚Äôt need to travel far from the coastal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX> to find a lifestyle hardly touched by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 21st century</TIMEX>. Traveling inland toward the towering peaks of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">D√≠kti Mountains</ENAMEX> brings you to a plateau that was cut off from the rest of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crete</ENAMEX> by all but donkey traffic until <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">well</ENAMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WWII</ENAMEX>. Improved access to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Las√≠thi Plain</ENAMEX> now allows <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> to view one of the few remaining old agricultural lifestyles in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX> climb up to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">850 m</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2,800 ft</NUMEX>) plain. From <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M√</ENAMEX>°lia you can pass through the tiny settlement of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kr√</ENAMEX>°si with a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2,000 year</TIMEX> old <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> tree gracing the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ker√°</ENAMEX> where you can visit <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Panag√≠a Kardi√≥tissa</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Our Lady of the Heart</ENAMEX>) before proceeding through the dramatic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">S√©li Amb√©lou Pass</ENAMEX>. Or you can rise from <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Ne√°polis</ENAMEX> through several small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> for a panoramic initial view of the plain and the impressive <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Psari Mad√°ra</ENAMEX> peak (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2148 m/7047 ft</ENAMEX>) beyond. One road links the small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> so you are sure not to miss any detail. Try to visit before <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">noon</TIMEX> or after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4pm</TIMEX>, especially in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> as most farming activity stops in the heat of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the afternoon</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Shepherds</ENAMEX> watch their somnolent flocks; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX> hand weed their vegetable <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">patches</ENAMEX>; laden donkeys make their way relentlessly towards <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX>; at harvest time the smell of ripe <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">grapes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">apples</ENAMEX> fills the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">air¬†‚Äî¬†this</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Las√≠thi.</ENAMEX> The small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">settlements</ENAMEX> are almost ghostly silent save for the crochet needles of the old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ladies</ENAMEX> or the clicking of old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men‚Äôs</ENAMEX> worry beads at the kafenion. Stop in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">√Ågios Ge√≥rgios</ENAMEX> to visit the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Folklore Museum</ENAMEX> and look for the remnants of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of small windmills that once powered water pumps. Now only a few still turn in the breeze, and irrigation is more high-tech. 
On the southern edge of the plain is a large cave said to be the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">birthplace</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Zeus¬†‚Äî¬†the Dictean Cave</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dict√©on √Åntron</ENAMEX>). Though no proof can be put forward for this claim, from the ancient votives left in the cave it was certainly very important during <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Minoan</ENAMEX> times. It is a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15-minute</TIMEX> walk from the parking lot, or you can take a mule ride up the narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">path</ENAMEX>. Be aware that the surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">underfoot</ENAMEX> is very slippery, and take a flashlight for better visibility. The cave drops precipitously <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">65 m</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">213 ft</ENAMEX>) into a dark cavern where the imagination begins to work overtime¬†‚Äî¬†what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">demons</ENAMEX> could lurk here? A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guide</ENAMEX> will help to point out details that your untrained eye might miss¬†‚Äî¬†such as the monstrous face of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kronos</ENAMEX> here to eat his new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">offspring</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zeus</ENAMEX>, and the small <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">nipple</ENAMEX> shaped stalagmites on which the infant god is said to have suckled.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictean Cave</ENAMEX> is one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crete‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most popular excursions and is very busy in the peak of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX>. The surrounding area is also replete with souvenir <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stalls</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ceramics workshops</ENAMEX> that either spoil the view or delight the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shopper</ENAMEX>, depending on your point of view.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East</ENAMEX> from √Ågios Nik√≥laos
Heading east from √Ågios Nik√≥laos the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> along the northern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">coast</ENAMEX> is in the long process of being updated. Follow the gulf south to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Istro</ENAMEX> where there are a cluster of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX>, and then on along the coastal plain to one of the major ancient sites in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">east¬†‚Äî¬†Gourni√°</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">18 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">11 miles</NUMEX>) south of √Ågios <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nik√≥laos</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Myriad stone walls¬†‚Äî¬†foundations</ENAMEX> for multi-storied <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">homes¬†‚Äî¬†linked</ENAMEX> by cobbled <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> blanket the hillside site of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gourni√°.</ENAMEX> Here more than any other site it is possible to envision ordinary <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Minoans</ENAMEX> going about their business. You‚Äôll be able to explore the marketplace and workshops of the artisans.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> sat at the top of the hill, its west court housing sacrificial slab and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazines</ENAMEX> for storage of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ritual liquids</ENAMEX> and libations as seen in other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Minoan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palaces</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gourni√°</ENAMEX> was a large <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, stretching down to the coast where it had an important <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port</ENAMEX>. Much remains to be discovered under the low scrub and rocks though there seems little intent to do so. The best overview of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Gourni√°¬†‚Äî¬†excavated by American Harriet Boyd Hawkes</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1900s¬†‚</TIMEX>Äî¬†is from the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> as it rises beyond the archaeological site.
From <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gourni√</ENAMEX>° the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> along the northern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">coast</ENAMEX> takes a series of switchbacks through the foothills of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Orn√≥n Mountains</ENAMEX>. There are tantalizing views of several mountain <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> and it is well worth leaving the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> to explore their upper reaches. Take a left turn down to the coast at the village of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M√≥chlos</ENAMEX>, now an easy-going village but during <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Minoan</ENAMEX> times an important site. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M√≥chlos‚Äô</ENAMEX> site sits on a small island <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only 150 m</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">480 ft</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">offshore¬†‚Äî¬†you</ENAMEX> can take a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> or swim across to reach it¬†‚Äî¬†though it was connected to the mainland <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3,000 years ago</TIMEX>. A little way offshore to the west is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ps√≠ra</ENAMEX>, for which you definitely will need <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat transportation</ENAMEX>.
Eventually the northern road drops into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sit√≠a</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a bustling</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 8,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, which benefits from its relative isolation from the main tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tavernas</ENAMEX> and waterfront caf√©s cater much more to local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clientele</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> makes a living from its busy <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Minoan</ENAMEX> settlement of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Petr√°s</ENAMEX> lies <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">.66 miles</NUMEX>) to the east and it was the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Venetians</ENAMEX> who made their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> on this hillside location, building a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fortress¬†‚Äî¬†the Kam√°rza¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†on its highest point. Unfortunately the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turks</ENAMEX> destroyed the old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Venetian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> when they took the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> but a network of narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> and stone steps spill down to a waterfront <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">promenade</ENAMEX>, and these have delightful architectural and lifestyle details to discover. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sit√≠a</ENAMEX> also has a pleasing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Archaeological Museum</ENAMEX> displaying finds from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Petr√°s</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gourni√°.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">You‚Äôll</ENAMEX> find it just south of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town center</ENAMEX>.
Sit√≠a is the gateway to the far east of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crete</ENAMEX>. Now sparsely populated, it is the site of several important <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minoan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> suggesting that far more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> lived here <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3,000 years ago</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">settlements</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> are small dusty <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> only recently benefiting from electricity. Many farming <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> still endure a difficult life on these low brush hills. For those who want to explore the area, accommodations can be rented in private <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> in the larger <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX>. Surprisingly even in this remote part of the island a procession of tour <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">buses</ENAMEX> arrives <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX> from √Ågios <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nik√≥laos</ENAMEX> and beyond. Its main attractions are easy to visit without the aid of a rental car.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crete‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most influential religious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toplo√∫ Monastery</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mon√≠ Toplo√∫</ENAMEX>), is found here on a windswept <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">hilltop</ENAMEX>, surrounded by large swathes of fertile land bequeathed to it by grateful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">believers</ENAMEX>. Founded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 14th century</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monastery</ENAMEX> was built for contemplation, but also for protection against the very real threat of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turks</ENAMEX>. Toplo√∫ is a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> word meaning <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cannon¬†‚Äî¬†the</ENAMEX> more correct title for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monastery</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Mon√≠ Akrotirian√≠¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†and it gives an indication that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> were no timorous recluses. Its walls put <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> in mind of a fortress rather than a religious <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">refuge¬†‚Äî¬†though</ENAMEX> even these were not enough to protect it against its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enemies</ENAMEX> and it was sacked several times in its early history. The order played a great part in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cretan</ENAMEX> uprisings against the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Turks¬†‚Äî¬†monks</ENAMEX> were hanged in <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1821¬†‚Äî¬†and</NUMEX> more recently against the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Germans</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WWII</ENAMEX> when it was a rallying point for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">native partisans</ENAMEX>. The abbot and several monks were shot in reprisal before the war‚Äôs end.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monastery</ENAMEX> has many treasures within its church¬<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">†‚Äî¬†‚ÄÇPanagi√° Akrotirian√≠¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Sixty-one</NUMEX> scenes from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> prayer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lord, Thou Art Great</ENAMEX> by renowned icon <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painter</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Io√°nnis Korn√°ros</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1770</TIMEX>) are among the highlights, along with jewel-encrusted vestments and reliquaries of precious metals. You can visit the simple monks‚Äô <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX> and explore the old flour <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mill</ENAMEX> which once brought income to the order. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> the farmland owned by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monastery</ENAMEX> produces organic olive oil considered some of the best on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crete</ENAMEX>. You can buy it at the small gift <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop</ENAMEX> along with icons and religious books.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northeast of Toplo√</ENAMEX>∫ is one of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Crete‚Äôs</ENAMEX> natural wonders. Amid this arid landscape an oasis of verdant <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">palms</ENAMEX> come into view and beyond a swathe of white <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sand ringing azure waters</ENAMEX>. This is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">V√°√Ø</ENAMEX>; definitely beautiful and very popular at the height of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the season</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">palms</ENAMEX> are said to have grown from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stone spat</ENAMEX> out by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pirates</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first millennium</TIMEX>, but today‚<ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">Äôs crops</ENAMEX> are not edible.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South of Toplo√</ENAMEX>∫ the road sweeps on to the modern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pal√©kastro</ENAMEX> and its nearby ancient site of the same name, then doglegs south to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Z√°kros</ENAMEX> where you can leave the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> and hike to the coast down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the most dramatic gorges in the east, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Valley</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dead</ENAMEX>. The trek takes <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">around 5 hours</TIMEX> and finishes at the village of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kato Z√</ENAMEX>°kros on the coast. Here you‚Äôll find several tavernas on the water‚Äôs edge and a flock of sea geese eager to sample your leftovers.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Minoan palace of Z√°kros</ENAMEX> lies just behind this strand on flat ground with its associated town rising up the hillside beyond. The last Minoan settlement to be excavated, it did not give up its secrets until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s</TIMEX> and revealed a wealth of undisturbed artifacts adding greatly to knowledge about this enigmatic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. Tools and ceremonial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX> were found just where they were dropped at the time of the great cataclysm along with the crystal rhyton on view in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ir√°klion Museum</ENAMEX> and a chest containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">clay tablets</ENAMEX> inscribed with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Linear</ENAMEX> A script; archaeologists even discovered an urn with olives preserved though the millennia. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Z√°kros</ENAMEX> was well-situated for trade with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Syria</ENAMEX> to the east and it had a large <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX> serving both commercial and naval <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> was founded by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Minoans</ENAMEX>, as there are no earlier remains below the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace complex</ENAMEX>. Building commenced around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1900</TIMEX> b.c., with remains from that date seen around the east <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX>. The palace proper was completed around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1600</TIMEX> b.c., and the destruction of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1450</TIMEX> b.c. saw a complete collapse of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>; it was never resettled. 
The west <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> was given over to cult <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">practices¬†‚Äî¬†with shrine</ENAMEX>, purification and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">libation rooms¬†‚Äî¬†as</ENAMEX> in other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Minoan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX>, with workshops in the south. The northern wing housed the royal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">entourage</ENAMEX> and the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen</ENAMEX>; the east was reserved for the royal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartments</ENAMEX>. Many of these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> had treasures in situ. 
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> unique aspect of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Z√</ENAMEX>°kros are the water features found in the east <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX> behind the royal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartments</ENAMEX>. The cistern <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX> contains a circular cistern still full of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, which is now inhabited by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">turtles</ENAMEX>. Nearby is a ceremonial spring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX> with steps leading to a small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square pool</ENAMEX>. You can then follow the traces of the paved <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> leading from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> to the ancient harbor, now lost beneath the waves.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southeastern Coast</ENAMEX>
Just beyond <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gourni√</ENAMEX>° it is possible to head south across the narrowest point on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crete</ENAMEX>, to the coastal <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ier√</ENAMEX>°petra <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">14 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">9 miles</NUMEX>) away. However, if you have the time it is much more rewarding to do the circular journey along the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">north</ENAMEX> coast to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sit√≠a</ENAMEX> then south around the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sit√≠a</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Orn√≥n Mountain</ENAMEX> ranges approaching <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ier√</ENAMEX>°petra from the east‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthe landscape is much more exciting.
Ier√°petra is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crete‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> largest settlement and has the honor of being the southernmost <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. It is a burgeoning <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX>, though it is much more laid back than those on the northern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">coast</ENAMEX>, making the most of its somewhat faded architecture, including a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Venetian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> and a dilapidated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX>. What the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> lacks in polish it makes up for in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">character¬†‚Äî¬†come</ENAMEX> here for genuine Cretan urban atmosphere. From the harbor you can also take trips to the southern island of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrissi</ENAMEX>. Only <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">13 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">8 miles</NUMEX>) from its larger sibling, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrissi</ENAMEX> still has unspoiled pine forest and pristine beaches to explore.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East</ENAMEX> and west of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ier√</ENAMEX>°petra are tiny coastal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">settlements</ENAMEX>. Explore the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Minoan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">settlements</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pyrgos</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mirtos</ENAMEX> to the west or have a relaxed lunch at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Myrtos</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> or nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">T√©rtsa</ENAMEX>. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Western Crete</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Western Crete</ENAMEX> offers a diverse range of attractions to explore. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> charming coastal <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">north coast</ENAMEX>, unspoiled <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">mountains</ENAMEX> where you can get back to nature or experience Cretan rural life, and tiny <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">south</ENAMEX> coast <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> reached only on foot or by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX>. Because of the mountains it is less densely populated than the east and has more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rainfall</ENAMEX>, making it greener and much more lush. These contrasts make it a fascinating part of the island to spend a vacation.
R√©thymnon
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">R√©thymnon</ENAMEX> lies <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">75 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 miles</NUMEX>) west of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ir√°klion</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one hour</TIMEX> away along the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">New National</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>. The site has been settled since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Minoan</ENAMEX> times, with the remains of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dorian</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> underlying the present <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Venetian</ENAMEX> rule spawned many of the architectural gems here though evidence of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> rule can still be seen. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">R√©thymnon</ENAMEX> suffered many <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">attacks</ENAMEX> and sackings over the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX>. Much of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> was badly damaged in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Battle for Crete</ENAMEX> during <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WWII</ENAMEX>, though the heart of the old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> survived. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> a modern tourist sprawl has grown up to the east taking advantage of the long sandy bay, but this has not spoiled the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> itself, which is a delight to stroll around. Take time to savor its <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cretan</ENAMEX> atmosphere.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">R√©thymnon</ENAMEX> has also been the intellectual center of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crete</ENAMEX> throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the ages</TIMEX> and still boasts a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">School of Philosophy</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August each year</TIMEX> it draws <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intellectuals</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> from across <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX> for a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Renaissance</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Festival</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Old Town</ENAMEX> occupies a strategic position on a nub of land jutting out from the long flat coastline. A huge fortress‚<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">ÄÇ‚Äî¬†the Fortezza¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†dominates the site, its walls rising high above the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> on the northwestern point. This is thought to be the largest fortification ever built by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Venetians</ENAMEX>, who completed the task in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1586</TIMEX>. The finest views of the walls are from the promenade on the waterfront. As you walk you can truly appreciate its grand scale. Once inside it is easy to imagine a large <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garrison</ENAMEX> and its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">entourage</ENAMEX> being based here, though there are few <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> left to explore. There is a small, whitewashed <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Orthodox</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chapel</ENAMEX> and the remains of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">barracks</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arsenals</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottoman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> made surprisingly light work of taking the fortress in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1646</TIMEX>. They worshipped in a large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX> in the center of the fortress, whose interior you can explore. Perhaps the most exciting part of the tour is the view over <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">R√©thymnon old</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> from the parapets on the eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">side¬†‚Äî¬†myriad tiled rooftops lead</ENAMEX> down to the harbor beyond. There are also views east and west along the bay.
Immediately outside the entrance to the fortress is an old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottoman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garrison building</ENAMEX> now housing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Archaeological Museum of R√©thymnon.</ENAMEX> The collection covers finds from the Neolithic age onward and concentrates on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Minoan</ENAMEX> finds in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äòlesser‚Äô</ENAMEX> (if one can use such a phrase for finds of this quality) <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX>, as there are no major <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palaces</ENAMEX> in the area. Cave sites have rendered some particularly interesting votive artifacts. Excavations of tombs have also been fruitful and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> displays some beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">clay sarcophagi</ENAMEX>. 
Walking right from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> and right again along the waterfront brings you to the enchanting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Venetian</ENAMEX> inner harbor, now a haven for small fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">craft</ENAMEX> and tour <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX>. At the end of the stone <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">jetty</ENAMEX> is a lighthouse erected during <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> rule and the harbor caf√©s were where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ottomans</ENAMEX> used to socialize over dark thick <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX> and communal narghiles (bubble pipes). <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> you can spend time over a drink or excellent fish dinner. 
The maze of narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> behind the old harbor forms the core of the old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>. Most are pedestrian-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only</NUMEX>, inviting you to take an exploratory stroll. At every turn there is something to see; most obvious will be the wealth of shopping opportunities at eye level. Craft and jewelry <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> create tempting displays, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">cotton</ENAMEX> clothing is swathed across every wall. But don‚Äôt neglect to look behind the wares to see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Venetian</ENAMEX> stone <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lintels</ENAMEX> above, or to catch site of ornate <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottoman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">balconies</ENAMEX> and pretty wooden window frames dressed with bougainvillaea or honeysuckle. At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> here come alive with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shoppers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">revelers</ENAMEX>, and there are excellent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> in some of the old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>.
If you exit the harbor from the southwest you can cross busy <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Od√≥s Arkad√≠ou</ENAMEX> to traffic-free <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Od√≥s Petih√°ki.</ENAMEX> On your left is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Venetian Loggia</ENAMEX> built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1600</TIMEX>. Until recently it was sadly neglected but it has risen like a phoenix from the ashes and now performs the role of an up-market <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">gallery</ENAMEX> where you can buy excellent copies of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> pieces. Walk down <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Petih√</ENAMEX>°ki to find the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rimondi Fountain</ENAMEX>. Built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1620s</TIMEX> its once fine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">carvings</ENAMEX> have taken on an aged <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">patina</TIMEX> and it looks strangely out of place among the bright Internet caf√©s now replacing traditional tavernas in this bustling <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>.
From here the main shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Od√≥s Ethnik√≥s Antist√°seos</ENAMEX>, leads southwest. Turn right at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Od√≥s Vern√°dou</ENAMEX> where you will find the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nerantzes Mosque</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Djam√</ENAMEX>≠ ton <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Neranzi√≥n</ENAMEX>), now used as a concert <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX>. Beyond this is the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Historical Folk</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Art Museum</ENAMEX>, providing an evocative glimpse at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crete</ENAMEX> of yesteryear. Everyday <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX> have been collected from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> around the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> and these include clothing, domestic and farm tools, and samples of traditional crafts. Ponder over old photographs of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cretans</ENAMEX> in traditional costume and try to imagine what the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> must have been like during their lifetimes.
Continue along <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Ethn√≠kos Antist√°seos</ENAMEX> and you will reach the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Venetian Porta Goura Gateway</ENAMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a few minutes</TIMEX>. This stone <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arch</ENAMEX>, once part of a greater structure, marks the boundary of the old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> and beyond it you are immediately plunged into the traffic-filled world of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 21st century</TIMEX>. Across this busy <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">highway</ENAMEX> is the tempting shade of the municipal gardens, which host the wine festival each <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July</TIMEX>.
Alternatively you could stroll along the waterfront east of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venetian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">harbor</ENAMEX>. There‚Äôs a good beach and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> is lined with caf√©s and tavernas offering tourist menus. When you reach tiny <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plate√≠a Ir√≥on</ENAMEX> look for the minaret of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kara Pasha</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX> standing sentinel above the surrounding <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South of R√</ENAMEX>©thymnon
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">area</ENAMEX> south of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">R√</ENAMEX>©thymnon is well worth exploring by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> to fully appreciate the rural lifestyle, however its major attraction can be visited by tour <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bus</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ark√°di Monastery</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mon√≠ Arkad√≠ou</ENAMEX>), in the foothills of the western <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">√çda Mountains</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">some 40 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">30 miles</NUMEX>) south east of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">R√©thymnon</ENAMEX>, was founded in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Byzantine</ENAMEX> era, though its present <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> date from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 16th century</TIMEX>. It is revered by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cretans</ENAMEX> as one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> of insurrection during the long struggle for independence. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1866</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">islanders</ENAMEX> rose up once again to wrest control of their land from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turks</ENAMEX>. As the bid failed, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partisans</ENAMEX> and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> sought <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">sanctuary</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">compound</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turks</ENAMEX> demanded their surrender, and when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abbot Gabriel</ENAMEX> refused, they attacked the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monastery</ENAMEX>. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9 November</TIMEX> they broke through the outer walls to find the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greeks</ENAMEX> blockaded into a wine <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">storeroom</ENAMEX> where they had a stash of gunpowder. As <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottoman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> made their way toward this last refuge, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abbot</ENAMEX> ordered that a shot be fired into the explosive. The resulting blast killed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cretans</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turks</ENAMEX>, giving real meaning to the battle cry of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Crete¬†‚Äî¬†‚Äòfreedom</ENAMEX> or death.‚Äô
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monastery</ENAMEX> is a much more peaceful place, though the wine <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">storeroom</ENAMEX> remains a charred shell. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">compound buildings</ENAMEX> have walls decorated with photographs and paintings of abbots and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partisans</ENAMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> has a battle-plan relief map of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1866</TIMEX> incident. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> which graces the middle of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">compound</ENAMEX> is one of the most beautiful on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crete</ENAMEX>. Its fa√ßade of yellow sandstone is richly carved with a fine bell <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX>, and mock Corinthian columns dignifying each of the twin <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">entranceways</ENAMEX>. Inside are fine icons, copies of which can be bought in the gift <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>. This displays sacred vestments and some of the monastery‚Äôs most valuable treasures. 
Make your way back to the coastal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Elefthern√°</ENAMEX>, site of an ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Doric</ENAMEX> site that has contributed artifacts to the archaeological collection at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">R√©thymnon</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Margar√≠tes</ENAMEX>, a potter‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> where you will be able to watch the artisans in action and buy some pretty souvenirs.
Directly south of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">R√</ENAMEX>©thymnon are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">valleys</ENAMEX> leading to the south coast. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Am√°ri Valley</ENAMEX> is the most easterly and the most exciting with traditional rural landscapes to explore and dramatic views of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mount √çda</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Psilor√≠tis</ENAMEX>) as a backdrop. As you travel along you‚Äôre sure to meet up with a shepherd herding his flock or donkeys at the roadside taking a rest from the day‚Äôs labors. The winding road leads through small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX>, many graced with fine old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX>. At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thr√≥nos</ENAMEX> visit <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 14th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Panag√≠a chapel</ENAMEX> for its frescoes and the remains of an early <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Byzantine</ENAMEX> mosaic floor from a previous basilica¬†‚Äî¬†if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> is locked ask at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop</ENAMEX> next door as they keep a key. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Head</ENAMEX> up the hill above the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> to explore the remains of the ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sybrita</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asom√°ton</ENAMEX> has a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Venetian Monastery</ENAMEX> now used as an agricultural <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">college</ENAMEX>, and in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Monastir√</ENAMEX>°ki there is a tiny <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Venetian chapel</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äòcapital‚Äô</ENAMEX> of the region, the village of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Am√°ri</ENAMEX>, is worth taking time to explore. Its narrow steep <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> are waiting to give up many secrets. The village‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Ag√≠a Anna chapel</ENAMEX> has the oldest frescoes on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crete</ENAMEX>, dating from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1225</TIMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Coast</ENAMEX>
The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> valley to the west leads down to the agricultural <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">center</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sp√≠li.</ENAMEX> Stop to try the waters at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Venetian fountain¬†‚Äî¬†a</ENAMEX> series of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">lion</ENAMEX> heads spout crystal clear, cool liquid from the mountains above¬†‚Äî¬†before exploring the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> itself. Though the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> does cater to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> above are little changed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX>.
Just before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sp√</ENAMEX>≠li are <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX> leading right toward the coast and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mon√≠ Pr√©veli</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pr√©veli Monastery</ENAMEX>). The farthest north of these takes you through the dramatic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kourtaliotiko Gorge</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mon√≠ Pr√</ENAMEX>©veli is a remote religious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> and, like other fellow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX>, it was involved in partisan activities during <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crete‚Äôs</ENAMEX> struggles for freedom. As you make your way to the present day site <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">you‚Äôll</NUMEX> pass the evocative ruins of an earlier <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monastery</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K√°to Pr√©veli</ENAMEX>) sacked by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turks</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1821</TIMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fathers</ENAMEX> aided many allied <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prisoners</ENAMEX> to escape in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WWII</ENAMEX>. Pr√©veli dates from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16th century</TIMEX> and was the richest religious order in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crete</ENAMEX> during the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottoman</ENAMEX> era. Its treasures are on display in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum shop</ENAMEX>. Do visit the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> to see its splendid <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">iconostasis</ENAMEX>, considered the best on the island. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">You‚Äôll</ENAMEX> also find a gold and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diamond</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crucifix</ENAMEX> said to contain a piece of the true <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cross</ENAMEX>.
From the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monastery</ENAMEX> make your way along the south coast road¬†‚Äî¬†a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">couple of kilometers</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3/4 mile</NUMEX>) inland¬†‚Äî¬†for an interesting tour. Nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Plaki√</ENAMEX>°s is a burgeoning resort situated along a <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crescent</ENAMEX> shaped bay. It makes a good base for a relaxing, low-key vacation. Further west, the walls of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Frangok√</ENAMEX>°stello can be seen rising up <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">above</NUMEX> a sandy beach. This immense <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">fortress</ENAMEX> is now just an empty <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shell‚ÄÇ‚Äî¬†like</ENAMEX> a set for a film about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">French Foreign Legion</ENAMEX>. It was built not only to ward off pirate raids but also to prove <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Venetian</ENAMEX> might to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cretan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">fighters</ENAMEX> in the mountains behind. During <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> rule the fortress was the scene of many bloody events, including the capture of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daskaloyi√</ENAMEX>°nnis in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1770</TIMEX> and the massacre of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">700</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cretans</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1828</TIMEX>. Statues nearby commemorate those who gave their lives. 
If you want to take time for lunch make a point of stopping at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ch√≥ra Sfak√≠on.</ENAMEX> There are several good tavernas along the waterfront of this small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">You‚Äôll</ENAMEX> also find a memorial to allied <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WWII</ENAMEX> here, as the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX> was an evacuation point after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Battle of Crete</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1941</TIMEX>. It is not possible to travel further west by <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> because the looming <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Levk√° Mountains</ENAMEX> meet the sea here. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Boats pick hikers</ENAMEX> up from the base of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Samari√° Gorge</ENAMEX> and at busy times rows of tour <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">buses</ENAMEX> await their return. You can take boat trips to the island of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G√°vdos</ENAMEX>, the most southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">territory</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, and to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Loutr√≥</ENAMEX>, a picturesque village with no vehicular access; or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> inland on foot for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Loutr√≥</ENAMEX> and the remains of ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">An√≥poli</ENAMEX> for an enjoyable day‚Äôs hiking.
Heading north by road once more, your journey will take you through the spectacular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Imbros Gorge</ENAMEX> with its recently released <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bald Eagles</ENAMEX> (among other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">prey</ENAMEX>). This gorge is more accessible than nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Samaria</ENAMEX> and you can walk down through it by leaving your <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> at the village of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Imbros</ENAMEX> or up from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ch√≥ra Sfak√</ENAMEX>≠on as the gradient is not too steep (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">8 km/5 miles</NUMEX>).
West toward <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chani√</ENAMEX>°
The stretch of coastline between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">R√©thymnon</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chani√</ENAMEX>° is developing fast. There are a number of new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Georgio√∫polis</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> with a long sandy beach and freshwater marshland on its western edge. Kal√≠ves is also a lively resort <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> not yet swamped by tourism. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> leads on to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">So√∫da Bay</ENAMEX>, home of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crete‚</ENAMEX>Äôs largest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port</ENAMEX> and one of the best deepwater anchorages in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> has a large <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base</ENAMEX> here but the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port</ENAMEX> also has a regular car ferry service to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Piraeus</ENAMEX> near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX>. The west of the island was the initial landing spot for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WWII</ENAMEX> and saw much fighting. A <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British War</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cemetery</ENAMEX> can be found at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of the bay.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Akrot√≠ri Peninsula</ENAMEX> sits north of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">So√∫da.</ENAMEX> Here you‚Äôll find <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Chani√°‚Äôs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX>, several small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> important monasteries. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Seventeenth-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Ag√≠a Tri√°da</ENAMEX> is still a major pilgrimage site and its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> is decorated with impressive modern icons. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mon√≠ Gouvern√©tou</ENAMEX>, a smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX>, lies further north. Its icon of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. John</ENAMEX> is the focus of many pleas for help. From here you can hike cross-country to the evocative remains of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Katholik√≥, Crete‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monastery</ENAMEX>, founded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 11th century</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. John the Hermit</ENAMEX>. Set on the side of a rocky ravine and incorporating several caves, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monastery</ENAMEX> was sacked by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pirates</ENAMEX>, after which the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> moved to higher ground and founded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gouvern√©tou.</ENAMEX> As you <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> back toward <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chani√</ENAMEX>° stop at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tomb</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Elefth√©rios Veniz√©los</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1834‚Äì1936</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crete‚</ENAMEX>Äôs greatest statesman, and that of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX>. On this spot on the orders of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Veniz√©los</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> flag was raised in defiance of talks taking place among the major <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> powers about the fate of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crete</ENAMEX>. There are wonderful views across the bay to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chani√</ENAMEX>° from here.
Chani√°
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chani√°</ENAMEX> was capital of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crete</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1845 until 1971</TIMEX> and it remains the island‚Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> largest settlement, with a great deal of urban development. However, at its heart is a delightful old town replete with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Venetian</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottoman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> and full of cosmopolitan atmosphere, considered to be one of the most beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> in the whole of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX>. 
The old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> was once enclosed by high curtain walls; though <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> only the western <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">curtain</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Shiavo-Lando Bastion</ENAMEX> survive. It‚Äôs well worth walking down <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Od√≥s Pire√≥s</ENAMEX> to examine the wall from beyond the protective ditch, to gain an impression of how the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> used to look.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venetian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">harbor</ENAMEX> draws <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locals</ENAMEX> alike. It is huge by comparison with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">R√©thymnon</ENAMEX> and has an outer and inner section. The harborfront is lined with beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">medieval buildings</ENAMEX> and numerous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">caf√©s</ENAMEX> and tavernas making it the place for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the evening</TIMEX> volta or stroll. The faded stucco of the harbor <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> takes on a delicate rosy hue as night falls, contrasting with the deep blue sky. On the northwest corner of the outer harbor is <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Firk√°s Tower</ENAMEX>, a restored section of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Venetian</ENAMEX> ramparts, which now houses the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Naval Museum</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Naftik√≥ Mous√≠o</ENAMEX>) displaying fine <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model ships</ENAMEX>, maps, and naval paraphernalia. Walk through the archway beyond the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> entrance for views east across the harbor from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> walls. You‚Äôll see the impressive rounded <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dome</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mosque</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Janissaries</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Djam√</ENAMEX>≠ ton <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genissari√≥n</ENAMEX>), built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1645</TIMEX> and now an exhibition <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">gallery</ENAMEX>, from where you can take a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horse</ENAMEX> and carriage ride from here through the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Old Town</ENAMEX>. Strolling past the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX> leads to the inner harbor, with the remains of large <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venetian</ENAMEX> arsenali (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ship</ENAMEX> repair <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">yards)¬†‚Äî¬†originally</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> lined the water‚Äôs edge. You can then continue out along the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pier</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">lighthouse</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Old Town</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fans</ENAMEX> out behind the harbor. Narrow alleyways with a m√©lange of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Venetian</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottoman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>, a canvas of faded terracotta and ochre stucco dressed with restaurant signs or wares for sale. The shopping here is the most sophisticated on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crete</ENAMEX>, a legacy of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chani√</ENAMEX>°‚Äôs <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> as an artistic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hideaway</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s</TIMEX>. A pre-planned itinerary is not essential <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">here¬†‚Äî¬†you‚Äôll</ENAMEX> probably be drawn by a pretty-looking balcony, turn down an alleyway to watch kittens playing, then a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boutique</ENAMEX> will catch your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">eye</ENAMEX> until eventually you‚Äôve lost your bearings. That‚Äôs all part of the appeal here, so relax and enjoy!
Although the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> all seem to run together, there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> sections of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Old Town</ENAMEX>. Topan√°s behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Naval Museum</ENAMEX> was the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> administrative quarter¬†‚Äî¬†also where they kept their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cannon</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Od√≥s Theotokopo√∫lou</ENAMEX> forms the uppermost <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> here, lined with fine <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venetian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansions</ENAMEX>. Walk on to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Od√≥s Zambelio√</ENAMEX>∫ to view the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Renieri Gate</ENAMEX> built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1608</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">√âvri√©ka</ENAMEX> to the southeast was the old <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Jewish Quarter</TIMEX> during <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Venetian</ENAMEX> times. Its small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> awash with pastel hues form the core of shopping and eating possibilities. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kast√©lli</ENAMEX>, east of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mosque</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Janissaries</ENAMEX> was the center of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Venetian city¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†as the name suggests there was an older <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> here, rendered obsolete when the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> expanded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16th century</TIMEX>. You‚Äôll see remnants of the stone block walls and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Venetian</ENAMEX> arcade at the bottom of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Od√≥s Agiou Markou</ENAMEX>. This was also the site of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Minoan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman Chani√°</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Kydon√≠a</ENAMEX>. Scant remains of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Minoan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> can be seen on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Od√≥s Karnev√°ro.</ENAMEX> The easternmost section of the old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spl√°nzia</ENAMEX>, characterized by cobbled alleyways and whitewashed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX>. Plate√≠a 1821 forms the core of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this quarter</TIMEX>, which has more authentic <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> life than any other part of old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chani√°.</ENAMEX> 
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Od√≥s Halidon</ENAMEX> is a major <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">thoroughfare</ENAMEX> that cuts the old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> from north to south. Here you‚Äôll find <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chani√°‚Äôs Archaeological Museum</ENAMEX> housed in an old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Venetian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monastery</ENAMEX>. There are numerous artifacts found at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Kydon√≠a Minoan</ENAMEX> site, but equally impressive <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greco-Roman</ENAMEX> remains including a collection of beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hellenistic</ENAMEX> mosaics.
Higher up Hal√≠don on the same <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">side</ENAMEX> as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Archaeological Museum</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cretan Folklore Museum</ENAMEX> tucked away in a tiny <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> alongside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roman Catholic Cathedral</ENAMEX>. These small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> are crammed with all kinds of everyday objects of old. Walk down <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Odos Skridl√≥f</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Leather Street</ENAMEX>), with its bazaar-like atmosphere, to reach the covered market, one of the shopping highlights of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crete</ENAMEX>. Erected in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1911</TIMEX>, its cross-shaped <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arcades</ENAMEX> offer cooling shade and you can buy the best of the island‚Äôs natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">products</ENAMEX> as souvenirs, while <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locals</ENAMEX> buy for the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">night‚Äôs meal</ENAMEX>. Look for the dried <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">herb</ENAMEX>, dittany (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">d√≠ktamus</ENAMEX>), commonly used to make herbal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">West of Chani√</ENAMEX>°
As there are no beaches near the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> stay in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX> west of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chani√°</ENAMEX> and travel in for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX>. Platani√°s is an excellent option with a lively atmosphere of its own, as is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ag√≠a Mar√≠na.</ENAMEX> Further west the island takes on less of a tourist feel and agriculture becomes the focus. M√°leme is the furthest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> proper before accommodations can only be found in private <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> or small local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> has a sad legacy as it was at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airfield</ENAMEX> here that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">paratroopers</ENAMEX> landed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1941</TIMEX>, signaling the start of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Battle for Crete</ENAMEX>. Casualties were high for these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pioneers</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> war <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cemetery</ENAMEX> above the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airfield</ENAMEX> holds the graves of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 4,000</NUMEX> young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>.
However, what this part of the island lacks in tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> it makes up for in open space and fresh air. Take to the hills along the rugged peninsulas of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rod√≥pou</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gramvo√∫ssa</ENAMEX>, jutting out from the northern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">coast</ENAMEX>; or visit numerous small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> in the western foothills of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">White Mountains</ENAMEX>. In the very far west, the wide sand beach at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Falasarn√°</ENAMEX> attracts day-trippers from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chani√°</ENAMEX> and further east. The <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">long</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M√</ENAMEX>°leme to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paleoch√≥ra</ENAMEX> on the south coast perhaps provides a microcosm of what western <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crete</ENAMEX> is all about. A wide lush coastal plain fills the start of the journey before the road climbs into the hills with magnificent views to the east. As the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> begins to drop from its apex, mountain <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> sit astride it like jewels on a thread until you reach the coast. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pale√≥chora</ENAMEX> awaits, with a great range of eateries to replenish you for the journey home.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White Mountains</ENAMEX> 
and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Samari√</ENAMEX>° Gorge
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">White Mountains</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lefk√° √ìri</ENAMEX>) dominate the western part of the island. The highest range on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crete</ENAMEX>, with several of its peaks breaking <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2,000 m</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5600 ft</ENAMEX>), there are no <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> in its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shadow</ENAMEX> because the mountains rise steeply with no perceptible foothills. This is an untamed landscape, rugged and stunningly beautiful, with narrow valleys incised between limestone peaks that wear a mantle of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">snow</ENAMEX> until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early summer months</TIMEX>. Yet in spite of this the mountains host <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crete‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most impressive, popular, and enjoyable excursions¬†‚Äî¬†the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">16-km-</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10-mile-</NUMEX>) walk down the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Samari√° Gorge</ENAMEX>.
The gorge is the longest in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> and starts in the heart of the mountains at a mighty <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3,352 m</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">11,000 ft</NUMEX>). In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> its path carries melted <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> from the peaks above. Only in the mild conditions of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX>, when the torrent turns to a trickle, are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> allowed to follow its path. The journey brings home the true power and wonder of nature. High walls of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stone</ENAMEX>, ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">cypress trees</ENAMEX>, rare <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">orchids</ENAMEX>, and soaring <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prey</ENAMEX> can all be seen, along with glimpses of the wild <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Cretan goat¬†‚Äî¬†the kri</ENAMEX>-kri¬<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">†‚Äî¬†bounding</ENAMEX> between precipitous crags. 
Despite the strenuous nature of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">trek¬†‚Äî¬†don‚Äôt</ENAMEX> set out without sturdy footwear, a hat, sunscreen, and an adequate supply of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">water¬†‚Äî¬†you‚Äôll</ENAMEX> share the narrow pathway with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intrepid tourists</ENAMEX>, which adds to the camaraderie but can spoil the atmosphere if you wanted to be alone with nature. Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> pay for an excursion that provides a bus ride to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of the gorge at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Omal√≥s</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> transfer at the southern end, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ag√≠a Roum√©li</ENAMEX> either east to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ch√≥ra Sfak√</ENAMEX>≠on or west to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">So√</ENAMEX>∫gia or <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paleoch√≥ra</ENAMEX> where you rejoin the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bus</ENAMEX>. If you travel independently you can take a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bus</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chani√</ENAMEX>° to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Omal√≥s</ENAMEX> and public transport from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ch√≥ra Sfak√</ENAMEX>≠on back to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chani√°</ENAMEX>, but confirm the timetables before you depart to avoid getting stranded. The gorge is open from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6am‚Äìsunset</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Park</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wardens</ENAMEX> give you a ticket, to be surrendered at the other end to ensure that no one is left stranded in the gorge at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the day</TIMEX>, and the descent begins at the xil√≥skalon (wooden staircase). With the wall of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mount G√</ENAMEX>≠ngilos towering above, the stone path drops sharply away in a series of switchbacks, falling <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3,280 ft</NUMEX>) in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">three km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 miles</NUMEX>). Slippery scree slopes fall below, so take it easy and keep to the path.
The route becomes less steep once you reach the rest point at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">chapel of √Ågios Nik√≥laos</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 1‚ÅÑ2 miles</NUMEX>) in, where there is a picnic area. The freshwater <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pools</ENAMEX> are inviting, but swimming is strictly forbidden. The abandoned village of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Samari√°</ENAMEX>, with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">its 14th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ossia Maria</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mary‚Äôs Bones</ENAMEX>), marks the halfway point. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> lived here until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1962</TIMEX>; now there‚Äôs only a warden‚Äôs post and first-aid <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX>. Beyond is the gorge‚Äôs narrowest point, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sider√≥portes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Iron Gates</ENAMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only 3.5 m</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> ft) wide but <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">300 m</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,000 feet</NUMEX>) high, a truly humbling sight and the most memorable, for from here the gorge opens up as it approaches the sea and is much less striking. The final stretch is perhaps the most grueling as you walk along the shadeless riverbed but at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ag√≠a Roum√</ENAMEX>©li you‚Äôll have perhaps the most <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">delicious drink</ENAMEX> you ever tasted!
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Excursion</ENAMEX> to Santorini
Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crete</ENAMEX> is an interesting and varied island you may want to take a day or two exploring a different <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX>. There are numerous excursions to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santorini</ENAMEX> to the north, and this tiny rock in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aegean</ENAMEX> makes an interesting contrast to its larger <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cousin</ENAMEX>.
The island of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santorini</ENAMEX> (also called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Thir√°</ENAMEX>) is one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">‚Äòmust see‚Äô</ENAMEX> places in the world. Arriving by sea brings the stunning vista slowly into view allowing the full magnitude of its structure to open out in front of you, for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santorini</ENAMEX> frames the largest volcanic crater in the world. 
A massive eruption of its volcano around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1500</TIMEX> b.c. carried the whole interior of the island high into the atmosphere, changing the climate of the earth for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> afterwards. In place of land came <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, surging in to fill the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">11-km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">7-mile</NUMEX>) long void and causing massive tidal waves around the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean Sea</ENAMEX>. 
What <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">remains</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> is the outer rim of the original circular island. Sheer cliffs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to 300</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">984 ft</ENAMEX>) high bound the caldera, and a number of whitewashed <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">settlements nestle</ENAMEX> along their <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">crests¬†‚Äî¬†looking</ENAMEX> from a distance like icing melting down the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">sides</ENAMEX> of a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> cake.
The main <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fir√°</ENAMEX>, set atop the high cliffs in the center of the long interior curve. Its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> tumble down towards the water below giving stunning views. A narrow cobbled trail of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">587</NUMEX> steps leads from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> to the small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX> below, now the domain of a fleet of donkeys that wait to carry cruise <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ship</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>. For those who would prefer a quicker method there is also a cable car which wings you from sea level in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a couple of minutes</TIMEX>. Most commercial ferries arrive at a new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Athinios</ENAMEX> further along the coast.
Fir√° is a shopper‚Äôs paradise, a series of narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">alleys</ENAMEX> where you can wander free from the fear of traffic, although do keep eyes and ears open for donkeys. You can buy anything from a reproduction icon to a genuine Faberg√© <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">egg</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designer</ENAMEX> jewelry of the finest quality and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designer</ENAMEX> clothing by the most desirable ‚Äònames.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äô</ENAMEX> Find a spot for a drink at sunset, which has to be one of the most spectacular on earth.
Among the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boutiques</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX> are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">places</ENAMEX> of cultural interest. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Archaeological Museum</ENAMEX> with pottery and other artifacts found on the island, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Megaron Gyzi Museum</ENAMEX> to the north of the cable car <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX>, which is housed in a beautiful <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">fortified house</ENAMEX>. Most exciting of its varied collections is a display of photographs showing island scenes from before the devastating <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1956</TIMEX> earthquake¬†‚Äî¬†the last major <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to strike the island.
Fir√° is beautiful but can get a little oppressive as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> crowd the narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>. A little way north is another smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> where the pace is a little less frantic. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">I√°</ENAMEX> (pronounced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oya</ENAMEX>), set on the northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">cliffs</ENAMEX>, became home to a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> and still maintains a more bohemian atmosphere than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fir√°.</ENAMEX> There are many <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> built into the hillsides and some have been converted into art <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">galleries</ENAMEX> and ‚Äòcollectibles‚Äô <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>. Its typical <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cycladic</ENAMEX> architecture and multicolored fa√ßades make it one of the most photographed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> in the world. 
Aside from the stunning views, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santorini</ENAMEX> has many more delights to show its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> to visit set among agricultural land. The fertile volcanic soil is blanketed in vines¬†‚Äî¬†over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100,000</NUMEX> bottles of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> are produced here every <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">year¬†‚Äî¬†or</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> producing tiny sweet <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tomatoes</ENAMEX>, a speciality here. In the center of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> is the village of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pirgos</ENAMEX> with the remains of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Venetian</ENAMEX> fortress at its heart. On a rocky bluff beyond the village you will find <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Monastery of Prof√≠tis Il√≠as</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monastery</ENAMEX> is only open when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priests</ENAMEX> inside take <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liturgies¬†‚Äî¬†mornings</ENAMEX> or early evenings¬†‚Äî¬†but it is well worth taking the time to visit. Pride of place goes to a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15-century</TIMEX> icon of the prophet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Elijah</ENAMEX>. It also has a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>, which conveys a flavor of monastic life, along with icons and manuscripts. Unfortunately the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">hilltop</ENAMEX> is also shared with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> military and it bristles with satellite and digital technology, prohibiting photography of the beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">panorama</ENAMEX>. On the east coast are beaches of fine black or red sand¬†‚Äî¬†another legacy of the volcanic activity¬†‚Äî¬†which heat to a ferocious temperature in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX> sun.
In the south of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> is one of the most important ancient sites in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX>. Near the modern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Akrot√≠ri</ENAMEX>, a complete <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> was discovered dating from before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> b.c. It was totally covered by <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">several feet</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ash</ENAMEX> during the eruption around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1500</TIMEX> b.c., but unlike the tragic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pompeii</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX>, no human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">remains</ENAMEX> have been found, leading <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> to believe that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> escaped before the disaster took place. Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1967</TIMEX> the site has been painstakingly excavated to give a picture of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> life before the great eruption. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">society</ENAMEX> of complexity and sophistication is being unveiled, including organized urban planning, heating, sanitation, and a standard script. However, much of the beautiful artwork found here is, for the moment, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Archaeological Museum</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">remains</ENAMEX>, which include <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> and pretty communal squares, have been placed under a protective corrugated roof that gets hot and crowded, so try to visit <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">as early in the day</TIMEX> as possible.
