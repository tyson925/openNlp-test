What to Do
Sports
At the top of the list of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bali‚</ENAMEX>Äôs great attractions are its beaches with the warm waters of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Indian Ocean</ENAMEX> lapping at the shores, but the range of active and sports choices is hardly limited to floating on the waves. The more unusual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spectator</ENAMEX> sports include colorful water buffalo races (on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lombok</ENAMEX>) and, to the horror of many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>, cockfighting, a local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">favorite</ENAMEX> on both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bali</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lombok</ENAMEX>, where it is sometimes carried on as part of religious ceremonies or festivals.
Watersports
Warm <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, gorgeous coral, and vivid fish make for great snorkeling over the reefs, especially off the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">north</ENAMEX> coast of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bali, Nusa Lembongan</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lombok‚Äôs</ENAMEX> offshore <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gilis</ENAMEX> (see page¬<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">†74</NUMEX>). Take your own equipment if you have it. Otherwise, many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> will lend or rent it to you¬†‚Äî¬†check the fit and condition carefully. Superb sites for SCUBA diving include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Menjangan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nusa Penida</ENAMEX> off <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bali</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gilis</ENAMEX>. Specialist tour <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operators</ENAMEX> rent out all the equipment and run <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX> for complete <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">beginners¬†‚Äî¬†make</ENAMEX> sure that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> you choose is licensed and that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">instructors</ENAMEX> are fully qualified, with international certification.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Surfing</ENAMEX> is a big attraction for many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Australians</ENAMEX>, who can zip over to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bali</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few days</TIMEX>; more recently, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">surfers</ENAMEX> have hit the waves. They head for the south and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">west</ENAMEX> coasts (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kuta, Uluwatu</ENAMEX>) in the dry <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX> and the east side (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nusa Dua, Sanur</ENAMEX>) in the wet <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX>. In most places, local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> with outrigger <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> are on hand to transport <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">surfers</ENAMEX> out beyond the reefs. Difficulty levels range from middling to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">extreme¬†‚Äî¬†there</ENAMEX> is no ‚Äúnursery slope.‚Äù
Most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX> give you a number of swimming options. When the tide or sea conditions don‚Äôt suit, there is usually a pool. If there isn‚Äôt one where you are staying, you may be able to use another <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hotel‚Äôs pool</ENAMEX> for a small charge.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jimbaran Bay</ENAMEX> has a sailing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">club</ENAMEX>, and you can windsurf from most of the resort beaches: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Equipment</ENAMEX> can be rented at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kuta, Benoa, Lovina</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sanur</ENAMEX>. Conditions are not ideal for beginners, though. Falling off on to coral is not only painful, it can also harm the fragile ecosystem of the reef.
Whitewater rafting is one of the newer activities. Tour <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> will pick you up at your <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX>, then take you to the launch point on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Ayung river</ENAMEX> near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ubud</ENAMEX>, and provide you with the necessary equipment for an exhilarating trip. 
On <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dry Land</ENAMEX>
Golf <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nusa Dua</ENAMEX> and up in the mountains at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Bali Handara Kosaido Country Club</ENAMEX> are both top-class, staging tournaments which bring some of the world‚Äôs best <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX>. There‚Äôs a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>-hole course at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sanur</ENAMEX>, and at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lombok</ENAMEX> there is the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">18-hole Suranadi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">course</ENAMEX>. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> offer their own tennis <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courts</ENAMEX>, some floodlit for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</TIMEX> use. Air-conditioned squash <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX> are available at a few places. As the sun starts to set, informal <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">soccer</ENAMEX> and volleyball games between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locals</ENAMEX> begin on the beach at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kuta, Tuban</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legian</ENAMEX>.
Walking in the countryside is one of the great pleasures of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bali</ENAMEX>. Don‚Äôt start at the southern <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX>, which are a long way from the best scenery, but begin instead up in the hills, where it‚Äôs cooler. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ubud</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bina Wisata Information Center</ENAMEX> or your <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX> can give you information on walks along the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Campuan Ridge</ENAMEX>, or through picturesque local <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">fields</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bookstores</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ubud</ENAMEX> sell detailed maps, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bali Pathfinder</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ubud Surroundings</ENAMEX>, that will help guide you along <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> pathways. Keep Walking <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tours</ENAMEX> (<balitrade@denpasar.wasantara.net.id>) at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tegun Galeri</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jalan Hanoman</ENAMEX> offers <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>- to <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">seven-hour</TIMEX> guided walks; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Victor Mason‚</ENAMEX>Äôs highly praised <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bali Bird Walks</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tel</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0361¬†975¬†009</NUMEX>) includes lunch, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, and use of binoculars. Both are very reasonably priced. At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Munduk</ENAMEX>, in the beautiful mountains southwest of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lovina</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Puri Lumbung Cottages</ENAMEX> (see page¬<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">†134</NUMEX>) offers an excellent program of walks, treks, and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX> in local arts and crafts.
More arduous and serious mountain <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">treks</ENAMEX> include climbing the active volcano <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Gunung Batur¬†‚Äî¬†a trek</ENAMEX> of several hours¬†‚Äî¬†and the crater rim and lake of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gunung Rinjani</ENAMEX> (on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lombok</ENAMEX>), which demands <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least three days</TIMEX> to complete.
Massage, both relaxing and therapeutic, is a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Balinese</ENAMEX> tradition that many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> have come to enjoy. The beaches are filled with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> offering reasonably good massage at prices that are very low. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ubud</ENAMEX> has many good massage <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> that offer very professional massage treatment, including mineral <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">baths</ENAMEX>, all for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">approximately US$10</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> and resorts offer similar treatment in more pampering surroundings for considerably more.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spectator Sports</ENAMEX>
Regular buffalo <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">races</ENAMEX> are held at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Negara</ENAMEX> in western <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bali</ENAMEX>, and on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lombok</ENAMEX>, with the normally sluggish <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">beasts</ENAMEX> pulling decorated <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">carts</ENAMEX> at surprising speeds. Kite-flying is a local obsession at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sanur</ENAMEX> and on the windswept <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bukit Peninsula</ENAMEX>. You can buy beautiful, hand-painted kites at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stands</ENAMEX> or from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hawkers</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sanur</ENAMEX> and also at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kuta</ENAMEX>.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lombok</ENAMEX>, ritual fights <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">long ago</TIMEX> took the place of war. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Balinese</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sasaks</ENAMEX> hurl packets of cooked <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX> at each other in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX> perang ketupet festival. Large crowds gather regularly in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lombok</ENAMEX> to watch peresehan contests in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> armed with rattan canes and leather shields lash at each other until the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">referee</ENAMEX> declares one of them the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">victor</ENAMEX>.
Entertainment
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Traditional Music</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puppetry</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dance¬</ENAMEX>†Performances
The sound of music in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bali</ENAMEX> can be the hypnotic tones of the gamelan <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">orchestra</ENAMEX>, or the alluring call of the disco beat at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kuta</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Legian</ENAMEX>, where the action begins at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midnight</TIMEX> and lasts until <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">dawn</TIMEX>. In the rest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX>, the nightlife is on a much smaller scale.
Bali‚Äôs own celebrated culture of dance and drama flourishes on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> levels: for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> and for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locals</ENAMEX> themselves. Ask at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hotels</ENAMEX>, travel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>, and tourist information <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> to find out what is scheduled during your stay. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">They‚Äôll</ENAMEX> probably point you towards some of the commercial performances put on in several <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX>, mostly in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ubud</ENAMEX> area. Tickets (including transport) are sold at the tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ubud</ENAMEX> and by many of the tour <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operators</ENAMEX>. Increasingly, the culture is packaged and brought to you in shows staged at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hotels</ENAMEX>. Some of these are of a very high standard: Dedicated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dancers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">musicians</ENAMEX> usually do give their best. But inevitably the atmosphere is different when they are performing for untutored <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> eating dinner, rather than for an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX> village <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">audience¬†‚Äî¬†and</ENAMEX> above all for their gods.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Drama</ENAMEX> and dance <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> will think that they‚Äôve gone to heaven when they see the unique temple ceremonies. If you are invited, be prepared to wait for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a long time</TIMEX>. Starting times are highly elastic, and then some events will last for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">many hours</TIMEX>. 
Many of the dances of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bali</ENAMEX> are also performed in western <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lombok</ENAMEX>, either for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Balinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> there or, increasingly, for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Senggigi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lombok</ENAMEX> also has its own special dances, which are rarely staged commercially. Some are for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> only¬†‚Äî¬†one simulating battle preparations probably derives from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Islamic</ENAMEX> tradition. The gandrung dance closely resembles <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bali‚</ENAMEX>Äôs joged, in that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> picks a male <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX>. Another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of dances is based on romantic legends from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sasak</ENAMEX> mythology, dating back to before the advent of Islam. Western-style nightlife is limited to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Senggigi</ENAMEX>, where some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> run <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">discos</ENAMEX> and local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> play in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar-restaurants</ENAMEX>.
The puppet shadow plays called wayang kulit (leather puppet) are not so often put on for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">tourists¬†‚Äî¬†the plots</ENAMEX> are too complex and the plays last too long (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">up to two days</TIMEX>) for foreign consumption. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> ceremony may give you a chance to join the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> for a while. You may look behind the screen¬<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">†‚Äî¬†it‚Äôs permitted¬†‚Äî¬†to</ENAMEX> see the dalang or puppet master <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">expertly</ENAMEX> controlling the beautiful figures, speaking all of their lines in a vast range of appropriate voices while conducting the small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">orchestra</ENAMEX>.
Dances of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bali</ENAMEX>
Legong: This is the visitors‚Äô favorite dance, performed by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX>: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> principal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dancers</ENAMEX>, the legongs, no more than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12 or 13 years old</TIMEX>, and an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attendant</ENAMEX>. Each is exquisitely dressed in glittering songket fabrics and wears a gilded and jeweled head-dress embellished with fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">frangipani</ENAMEX> (plumeria) <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>. The usual version (legong kraton) is the tale of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX> and the princess he has abducted, performed by the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principals</ENAMEX> who, using various hand and facial gestures, portray the attempted seduction. 
Kecak: Part of a much longer ritual trance-dance which is called sanghyang, this is mostly performed separately. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Up to 150</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> in sarongs crouch in concentric circles around a flickering lamp and chant hypnotically while the story is acted out in the center of the circle. Taken from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ramayana</ENAMEX>, the dance concerns <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rama</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sita</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkey</ENAMEX> armies of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hanuman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sugriwa</ENAMEX>, hence the kecak‚Äôs popular title of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚ÄúMonkey Dance</ENAMEX>.‚Äù The dance as performed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> was choreographed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter Spies</ENAMEX>, who did so much to influence art in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ubud region</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1930s</TIMEX>.
Pendet: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Six</NUMEX> or more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> carrying trays of flower petals open <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the evening</TIMEX> by scattering the petals over the stage as a symbol of welcome. At the same time, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> may light an incense-burning lamp. At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> ceremonies the pendet is danced to welcome the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">gods</ENAMEX>.
Janger: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twelve</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> and twelve <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> form a square, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> kneeling and swaying together to the music like reeds in the wind. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX>, wearing false moustaches, try to impress the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> as they strut and preen like fighting roosters.
Joged: A whole <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of dances shares this name, performed to the music of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">orchestra</ENAMEX> of bamboo xylophones and gongs. But <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>, properly called the jegog, has become so popular that it alone is often considered to be joged. A young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> dances alone at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, and then taps <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> in turn to dance with her. Try as they may to flirt or show off, she easily slips away from their advances. Few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Westerners</ENAMEX> look anything but clumsy in comparison.
Barong: A <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mythical lion</ENAMEX>-like <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX>, the barong is covered in long hair and little mirrors. Animated by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>, it fights against the evil <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rangda</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">queen</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witches</ENAMEX>. Her long claw-like fingernails hold a white cloth to hide her terrible face, bulging eyes, fangs, and flaming tongue while she advances on her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">Allies</ENAMEX> of the barong, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> wearing sarongs and each carrying a kris, try to attack Rangda but she puts them under a spell. In a trance, they turn the knives on themselves. Only the reappearance of the barong saves them.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> performances for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">each morning</TIMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Batubulan</ENAMEX>, for instance) the trances are inevitably simulated. Late at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> in a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX>, however, you would see the wild-eyed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> in a genuine frenzy or collapsing at the climax into unconsciousness, until revived by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priests</ENAMEX> who sprinkle them with holy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>.
Other <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Dances</ENAMEX>: Other performances you might see include scenes from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hindu</ENAMEX> epic drama, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ramayana</ENAMEX>, staged as a ballet. These may well be a showcase for fine dancing, gorgeous costumes, and the full range of the gamelan <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">orchestra</ENAMEX>. In the topeng, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dancers</ENAMEX> are masked, meaning that they can convey <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> and emotion through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">movement</ENAMEX> alone. The stories are taken from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Balinese</ENAMEX> history and mythology. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kebyar</ENAMEX> is the name of a group of solo dances of which the best known are performed by a seated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>, using only the upper <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baris</ENAMEX> is a vehicle for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of young male <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dancers</ENAMEX> to display their command of technique, conveying a great range of emotions.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Festivals</ENAMEX> and Events
Most festivals are fixed by calendars different from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Western</ENAMEX> version (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">91</NUMEX>), so they change <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each year</TIMEX>. Look for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indonesian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Directorate of Tourism‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> Calendar of Events, which is published in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bali</ENAMEX> and gives dates and locations of temple festivals. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> celebrations stick to fixed dates: The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter Spies</ENAMEX> festival in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Arts Festival</ENAMEX>, with superb performances, which is held in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Denpasar</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late June and early July</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shopping</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bali</ENAMEX> produces a wide range and large quantity of crafts in every medium. Most of the decorative arts and crafts originally had a religious connection, as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple embellishments</ENAMEX>, offerings, or ceremonial dress. The land yielded plenty to eat without the need to work <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all day</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX>, so <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> had time to create objects of beauty. The tradition continues, although production has been multiplied by the demand for souvenirs. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">craft</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> have workshops attached, or you can watch the carvers, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painters</ENAMEX>, or weavers in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">adjoining compound</ENAMEX>.
In the past, nothing was expected to last: The climate and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX> saw to that. So hardly anything is very old¬<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">†‚Äî¬†‚ÄúAntiques Made to Order‚</ENAMEX>Äù shop signs give the game away. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Wood carvings</ENAMEX>: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Dozens</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> devote themselves to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bali‚</ENAMEX>Äôs biggest <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">craft</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mas</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41</NUMEX>) is the best-known, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of carvers and countless <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>. Behind the scenes¬†‚Äî¬†but you may be invited for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">visit¬†‚Äî¬†fathers</ENAMEX> pass on their skills to their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sons</ENAMEX>, while the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> do the polishing or painting. The best carvings are superb sculptures, but even the simplest, cheapest article can make an appealing souvenir. Among the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">massed garuda birds</ENAMEX> and masks, you‚Äôre bound to find something beautiful. 
The sign <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">‚ÄúParasite Carvings‚Äù</ENAMEX> might puzzle you. A new idea, imported from the West, is to take the galls and other strange growths that occur on tree trunks and carve them into a witty or grotesque design, using the natural shape.
Jewelry: The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Celuk</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX>) specialized in producing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">silver</ENAMEX> and gold jewelry for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX>, so when tourism arrived, its position on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Denpasar-Ubud</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> was ideal. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Dozens</NUMEX> of tour buses stop at the big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> but there are many little workshops worth visiting, too. The smiths can produce any style: from intricate filigree work to simple bracelets. You don‚Äôt have to go to Celuk though, since every <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">resort area</ENAMEX> has its share of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Silver</ENAMEX> should bear the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚Äú925‚</NUMEX>Äù stamp of sterling silver (meaning it‚Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">92.5%</NUMEX> pure).
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clothes and Fabrics</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bali</ENAMEX> is a huge bargain <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">basement</ENAMEX> for a selection of beachwear, casual clothing, and, at a higher price but still excellent value, fashion designs. For the biggest choice of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> go to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kuta</ENAMEX>, and look for dresses, shirts, sarongs, and cover-ups in traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">batik fabric</ENAMEX>. 
Batik dyeing technique uses hot wax to draw or stamp a design on cloth before dipping it in the dye, so that the waxed areas are left undyed. The process can be repeated a number of times for greater complexity. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Java</ENAMEX> is the source of the batik for dresses and sarongs sold in fashion <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Balinese</ENAMEX> versions are usually much coarser. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hawkers</ENAMEX> will swear that their dress lengths of cheap printed <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">cotton</ENAMEX> are batik. It‚Äôs easy to tell that they are not: Printed patterns don‚Äôt penetrate fully to the other side, while the real batik will show thin veins of color where the dye runs along tiny cracks in the wax (printed versions may try to simulate this). Real batik is always much more expensive. Used batik sarongs are highly prized, as their patterns are often no longer produced. Used <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">batik</ENAMEX> can be bought for very low fixed prices at textile <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alec</ENAMEX>, on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jalan Legian</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuta-Legian</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Endek</ENAMEX> or ikat fabrics, using threads dyed in patterns before weaving, come from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gianyar</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bali</ENAMEX> as well as other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indonesian</ENAMEX> islands. In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bali</ENAMEX>, only the weavers of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tenganan</ENAMEX> make grinsing, or double ikat, using pattern-dyed threads for both warp and weft. The genuine fabric is justifiably <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">expensive¬†‚Äî¬†beware</ENAMEX> of fakes! You can find bold, primitive examples of ikat cloth, especially from islands such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sumba, Flores</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Timor</ENAMEX>, in good textile <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>.
Paintings: If you want a unique work of art, you‚Äôll need to study the field. Visit the major collections to judge the standard of the best paintings, especially the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Neka Museum</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum Puri Lukisan</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ubud</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41</NUMEX>) as well as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arts Centre</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Denpasar</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37</NUMEX>). Don‚Äôt just assume that a high price guarantees original work.
And <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">More‚Ä¶ Look</ENAMEX> for the basketry from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bona</ENAMEX>, leather wayang kulit puppets from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puaya</ENAMEX> near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sukawati</ENAMEX>, and decorative umbrellas on roadside <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stalls</ENAMEX> east of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Klungkung</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Shops</ENAMEX> take advantage of the tourist traffic to sell the products of other islands, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">too¬†‚Äî¬†embroidery</ENAMEX> and songket fabrics from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sumatra</ENAMEX>, primitive art from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Irian Jaya</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">silver</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sulawesi</ENAMEX>.
Lombok: Craft skills in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lombok</ENAMEX> tend to be devoted to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">household objects</ENAMEX> that can have a somewhat austere functional beauty. Look for the delicate, tightly-woven basketware, whether in mats, boxes, bowls, and bags, or the common Lombok souvenir of a model <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">barn</ENAMEX>. Painted wood boxes to store <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spices</ENAMEX>, tobacco, or jewelry are attractive. Simple red pottery comes from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Penujak</ENAMEX>, and black pots from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rungkang</ENAMEX> are bound in an intricately woven basket.
Necessities: Some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">supermarkets</ENAMEX> and convenience <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> have opened in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Denpasar</ENAMEX>, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tiara Dewata</ENAMEX>, on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jalan Jenderal Sutoyo</ENAMEX>, with books, shoes, cosmetics, and even a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">playground</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and a swimming pool. There is a similar big shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> near the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX>, while smaller ones can be found in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuta</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nusa Dua, Senggigi</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lombok</ENAMEX>. In big <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX>, modern grocery <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, with big <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">red ‚ÄúK‚Äù signs</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Circle¬†K</ENAMEX>) are open <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours a day</TIMEX> and sell all kinds of necessities.
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Bali FORCHILDREN</ENAMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Balinese</ENAMEX> treasure their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and yours will get the same treatment. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX> run children‚Äôs activity programs during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX>, show videos in the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early evening</TIMEX>, and at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> offer a babysitting service when you want to go off on your own. In losmen and homestay accommodations, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> of the owner‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> will probably want to make <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>, and the older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> may offer to act as babysitters.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Children</ENAMEX> will, of course, revel in the hotel <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pools</ENAMEX> and the beaches, the slides at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Waterbom</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tuban</ENAMEX>, and when the conditions are right, they can learn to snorkel, sail, and windsurf¬†‚Äî¬†but think about their safety. The well-planned <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Taman Burung Bali Bird Park</ENAMEX>, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over a hundred</NUMEX> species of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX>, is always a hit with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>.
