WhERE TO GO
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> he grey-green <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Danube</ENAMEX> cuts straight through the heart of the city¬†‚Äî¬†neatly separating the ancient cobblestone <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buda</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late-19th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boulevards</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pest</ENAMEX>. If you love history you‚Äôll probably head for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buda</ENAMEX> side of the river, but if you‚Äôre a keen <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shopper</ENAMEX> and enjoy lively nightlife, then <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pest</ENAMEX> will certainly oblige. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Orientation</ENAMEX> is rarely a problem, as the majority of sights are crammed into the central areas and getting around the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> is very easy. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Castle Hill</ENAMEX> is made for walking, and the rest of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> is efÔ¨Åciently served by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">buses</ENAMEX>, trams, trolleybuses, and underground <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trains</ENAMEX>.
This section follows the natural layout of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, starting on the western <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buda, Obuda</ENAMEX>, and the hills, and then moves across the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Danube</ENAMEX>, stopping at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Margaret Island</ENAMEX>, and over to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pest</ENAMEX> on the opposite side of the river. It is perhaps best to sample <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Budapest</ENAMEX> piecemeal: taking a little from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> side, then crossing over the river to the other, and heading back again. However, most would agree that the best place to start is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Castle Hill</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Castle Hill</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Varhegy</ENAMEX>)
This fascinating area is the most picturesque and peaceful spot in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Budapest</ENAMEX>, giving the only clue as to how the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">medieval city</ENAMEX> once looked. Entire <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> of beautiful old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> are concentrated here, and almost every other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX> bears a mueml√©k (monument) plaque which tells of its history. As serene as it seems <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, however, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">district</ENAMEX> has suffered destruction upon destruction in the past, and many places have been rebuilt at least once.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">area</ENAMEX> overlooks the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> from a long, narrow plateau, divided into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>: the southern part, occupied by the enormous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Palace</ENAMEX> where the original <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> once stood, and the northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">district</ENAMEX> of historic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>, where <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14th- and 15th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">aristocrats</ENAMEX> and artisans once rubbed shoulders.
From <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pest</ENAMEX> there are various ways of getting up to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Castle Hill</ENAMEX>. The most popular method of ascent is aboard <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sikl√≥</ENAMEX> (funicular) which starts by the end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Chain Bridge</ENAMEX> and rises to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Palace</ENAMEX>. Alternatively take the metro to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Moszkva t√</NUMEX>©r, climb up the steps to the road, and catch the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mini</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V√</ENAMEX>°rbusz service which <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">shuttles</ENAMEX> to and from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">D√≠sz t√©r</ENAMEX>, stopping at numerous points en route. You could simply walk up the hill using any one of several <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">staircases</ENAMEX>, but one method you cannot use is your own transport; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> are forbidden on the hill (unless you are a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">resident</ENAMEX> or a guest at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hilton Hotel</ENAMEX>), thus preserving the area‚Äôs historic ambience.
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Historic Streets</ENAMEX>
Turning right at the funicular terminus, a short walk brings you to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">D√≠sz t√©r</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parade Square</ENAMEX>) which marks the start of the northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">district</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M√°ty√°s</ENAMEX> templom (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Matthias Church</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">spire</ENAMEX>, towering gracefully over this historic area, is the best reference point for our tour. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> takes its name from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hungary‚</ENAMEX>Äôs favourite medieval <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX>, who married here twice in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 15th century</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Emperor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Franz Joseph</ENAMEX> I was crowned <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hungary</ENAMEX> here in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1867</TIMEX>, to the tune of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Coronation Mass</ENAMEX>, composed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Liszt</ENAMEX> for the occasion.
The original <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> was built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-13th century</TIMEX>, converted into a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX> during the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">occupation</ENAMEX>, and seriously damaged during <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Buda‚</ENAMEX>Äôs recapture in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1686</TIMEX>. It was rebuilt in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baroque</ENAMEX> style after the return of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">forces</ENAMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1873 and 1896</TIMEX> it was completely reconstructed along its present <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Neo-Gothic</ENAMEX> lines.
The unusual multi-coloured <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diamond</ENAMEX>-pattern roof and geometric designs covering the inside walls date back to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th-century</TIMEX> refurbishing; the motifs are therefore <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hungarian</ENAMEX> and not <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX>.
Tour guides are quick to point out the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Loreto Chapel</ENAMEX> (immediately to the left of the entrance), where a red marble statue of the Virgin takes pride of place. At the east end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> is the entrance to the crypt and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>, which holds a Ô¨Åne collection of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medieval stone carvings</ENAMEX>, sacred relics, historic vestments, and religious paintings. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> rambles up and down old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">staircases</ENAMEX> around the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>, offering at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> spot an excellent view down onto the nave.
Outside the front of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> in the centre of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Szent</ENAMEX>-h√<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">°roms√°g t√©r</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trinity Square</ENAMEX>) is a votive column, crowded with statues of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">saints</ENAMEX> and angels, which recalls a bubonic plague epidemic of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 18th century</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">survivors</ENAMEX> built the monument in gratitude for being spared. Behind the column there is a Ô¨Åne <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Neo-Gothic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> that puts on temporary exhibitions and also offers accommodation. Looking across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>, towards <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D√</ENAMEX>≠sz t√©r, the Baroque <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-storey white <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> with a jutting corner balcony served as the former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buda</ENAMEX> town hall from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1710 to 1873</TIMEX>. 
Behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> is the most photographed monument in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Budapest</ENAMEX>, the intriguingly-named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hal√°szb√°stya</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fishermen‚Äôs Bastion</ENAMEX>). Built onto the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> walls, at Ô¨Årst glance this picture-book array of turrets, terraces, and arches could easily pass for authentic medieval fortiÔ¨Åcations, but they are in fact too good to be true, constructed around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the turn of this century</TIMEX> as pure ornamentation. The name refers to the Ô¨Åshermen who defended the ramparts here in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 18th century</TIMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> it is a busy place, with coachloads of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> peering through the arches for one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">city‚Äôs finest views¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†across the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Danube</ENAMEX> and over to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Houses</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parliament</ENAMEX>. At the handsome equestrian statue of the canonized <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Istv√°nn</ENAMEX>, old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ladies</ENAMEX> trade <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Transylvanian</ENAMEX> tablecloths, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">zithers</ENAMEX> sing sweetly, and barrel-organs grind while classical buskers Ô¨Åll the air with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bart√≥k</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Liszt</ENAMEX>.
The view west from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Fishermen‚Äôs Bastion</ENAMEX> focuses on the startling, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>-storey reÔ¨Çective fa√ßade of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Budapest Hilton Hotel</ENAMEX>. The bold approach of shamelessly merging ancient and modern has integrated the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1977</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hilton Hotel</ENAMEX> with the remains of a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jesuit</ENAMEX> college and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> of the district‚Äôs oldest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>, dating from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 13th century</TIMEX>.
Across on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hess Andr√</ENAMEX>°s t√©r, the bas-relief of a red hedgehog at number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> recalls <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 18th century</TIMEX>, when the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> was an inn of that name. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> on the hill there‚Äôs no better place for light refreshment than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ruszwurm‚Äôs</ENAMEX>, a mere scone‚Äôs throw away at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">7 Szenth√°roms√°g utca.</ENAMEX> This cosy patisserie has been <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">resident</ENAMEX> here since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1827</TIMEX>; its cakes compete favourably with the best the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> has to offer.
Start your tour of the old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> along <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">T√°ncsics Mih√°ly</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">utca</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">House</ENAMEX> number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beethoven</ENAMEX> stayed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1800</TIMEX>, is now the charming <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Museum of the History of Music</ENAMEX>. Here you‚Äôll learn to tell your clavichord from your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hurdy-gurdy</ENAMEX> and that bagpipes are also an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hungarian</ENAMEX> instrument. Next door at number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> are plaques to political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heroes</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mih√°ly T√</ENAMEX>°ncsics and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lajos Kossuth</ENAMEX>, both imprisoned here in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1830s and 1840s</TIMEX> for their nationalist beliefs. Number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX> served as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">synagogue</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the 14th century</TIMEX>; a small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> relates to this period. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> ends at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B√</ENAMEX>©csi kapu (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Vienna Gate</ENAMEX>), a reminder that the district was once fully enclosed. The grand <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> next to the gate with the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diamond-patterned roof¬†‚Äî¬†echoing</ENAMEX> that of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. M√</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">°ty√°s¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Archive</ENAMEX> (open to the public).
Fortuna utca is a charming, much-photographed <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> full of pastel-painted <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> and takes its name from a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tavern</ENAMEX> which stood at number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1785 to 1868</TIMEX>. Today this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum of Commerce</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Catering</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Kereskedelmi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">√©s Vend√©gl√°t√≥ipari M√∫zeum)¬†‚Äî¬†nowhere</ENAMEX> near as grand (nor as boring) as its name suggests¬<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">†‚Äî¬†dealing</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">confectionery</ENAMEX> in one section and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hungarian</ENAMEX> trade in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 19th</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 20th century</TIMEX> in another. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">curators</ENAMEX> take a genuine delight in demonstrating various exhibits: it‚Äôs well worth a visit.
At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Szenth√</ENAMEX>°roms√°g t√©r turn back into <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Orsz√°gh√°z utca</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Orsz√°gh√°z</ENAMEX>, which means <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Houses</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parliament</ENAMEX>, takes its name from the parliamentary sessions which took place in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> at number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1790 and 1807</TIMEX>. The architectural highlights of this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>, however, are the grand <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansion</ENAMEX>, now used by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Alab√°rdos (‚Äúhalbardier‚Äù</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX>, as well as numbers <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18‚Äì22</NUMEX>, which are considered <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of the Ô¨Ånest examples of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14th- and 15th-century</TIMEX> domestic architecture on the hill. Several other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> on this street incorporate picturesque medieval features, at times hidden just inside the archway. Here you‚Äôll see both ancient stone <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sedilia</ENAMEX> (built-in seats for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>) and vignettes of contemporary life with an equally timeless quality, such as necklaces of paprika strung across windows and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">balconies</ENAMEX> to dry; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> do still live here.
At the end of this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> rises a large, glassless <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> window. It belongs to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Church of Mary Magdalene</ENAMEX>, reduced to knee-high remains (by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Allies</ENAMEX>) in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last days</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War</ENAMEX> II. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amazingly</ENAMEX>, its huge, rocket-like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> survived and now houses a private <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">art gallery</ENAMEX>. The stone window was rebuilt, but the remainder of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> was left levelled as a poignant reminder of events. An altogether more light-hearted curiosity can be seen on the corner of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Orsz√°gh√°z utca</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Petermann</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">b√≠r√≥ utca</ENAMEX>. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚ÄúÔ¨Çying nun‚Äù</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stone</ENAMEX> (a reference to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">convent</ENAMEX> that occupied number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX> before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parliament</ENAMEX>) has apparently passed straight through the corner of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mikl√≥s Melocco</ENAMEX> executed this amusing sculpture in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1977</TIMEX>.
Uri utca, meaning gentlemen‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>, is even older than <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Orsz√°gh√°z utca</ENAMEX>, and the details on many of its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> are equally fascinating. Yet another specialist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> crops up at number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">49</NUMEX>; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Telephone Museum</ENAMEX> features 110 years of telephone <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchanges</ENAMEX> and technology. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Budapest</ENAMEX> had the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> telephone <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX>.
At number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> you can descend deep into the hill via a series of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tunnels</ENAMEX> that were dug in medieval times as an escape route in times of siege. They were used again as air-raid shelters and an emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1944‚Äì1945</NUMEX>. Here <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> can join a guided tour of the caves and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tunnels</ENAMEX>, which also contain a waxwork exhibition depicting episodes of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hungarian</ENAMEX> history.
Uri utca terminates at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">D√</ENAMEX>≠sz t√©r, where it‚Äôs best to turn and walk back along <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">T√°rnok</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">utca</ENAMEX>. Among the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> here are a number of Ô¨Åne <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>. The orange-and-red geometric frescoes painted on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">overhanging Ô¨Årst Ô¨Çoor</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aranyhord√≥</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golden Barrel</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX> are the most noteworthy. Next door, number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> was built as a merchant‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Ô¨Årst half of the 15th century</TIMEX>. Used as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arany Sas</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golden Eagle</ENAMEX>) pharmacy from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1750 until 1913</TIMEX>, it is now the most attractive of this area‚Äôs small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX>. Beautiful old majolica <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX> are the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stars</ENAMEX> of an atmospheric re-creation of the pharmacy, and there are also informative displays on potions, practices, and alchemy in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Budapest</ENAMEX> of this era.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Ô¨Ånal street</ENAMEX> of this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">district</ENAMEX> to be explored is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">leafy T√≥th Arp√°d s√©t√°ny</ENAMEX>. This promenade, situated along the western ramparts, offers views of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Buda Hills</ENAMEX> and the huge <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern Railway Station</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">D√©li p√°lyaudavar</ENAMEX>) rather than a glorious <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Danube</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">panorama</ENAMEX>. Nonetheless, this is a delightful stroll, particularly in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early evening</TIMEX>, when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locals</ENAMEX> come out to enjoy the fresh air. At the northern end, various cannon signal the entrance to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum of Military History</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hadt√∂rt√©neti M√∫zeum</ENAMEX>). It‚Äôs an extensive exhibition and popular with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">section</ENAMEX> dedicated to the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1956</TIMEX> uprising is the most memorable for older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Palace</ENAMEX>
Now returned to its former outward splendour, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Palace</ENAMEX> dominates <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Castle Hill‚</ENAMEX>Äôs southern skyline. Construction began in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 13th century</TIMEX> and reached its zenith in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 15th century</TIMEX> under <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">King M√°ty√°s</ENAMEX>, when the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> was said to be equal in grandeur to that of any in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. Under the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottoman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX>, however, it was neglected, and during the siege of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1686</TIMEX> was destroyed. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the following two centuries</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> was rebuilt in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Neo-Baroque</ENAMEX> style. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nemesis</ENAMEX> was on hand again when the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">occupation forces</ENAMEX> made this their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX> during a Ô¨Ånal stand in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1945</TIMEX>. Since then, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> has been rebuilt purely to house <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX> and a library. It‚Äôs a huge place and can‚Äôt be covered in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX>. Break up your time here with sightseeing on the northern part of the hill.
If you are not already on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Castle Hill</ENAMEX>, then the best approach to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Palace</ENAMEX> is from the steps at the southern tip of the hill by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Semmelweis Medical Museum</ENAMEX>. The path winds up through lovely gardens to the rear entrance of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> and the only surviving turreted <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buzog√°ny</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mace) Tower</ENAMEX>. Steps lead up through tiny <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> gardens to the entrance of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum of Budapest History</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Budapesti T√∂rt√©neti M√∫zeum</ENAMEX>) in wing E of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Palace</ENAMEX>.
More than 40 years of excavations at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace site</ENAMEX> have produced a picture of the medieval <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Palace</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">King M√°ty√°s</ENAMEX>; it is possible to visit the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten or so</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> that have survived from the original, now reconstructed in their former <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. Make sure you see the exhibition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gothic</ENAMEX> statues from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Palace</ENAMEX>. During construction work at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the start of the 15th century</TIMEX>, the statues were thrown out in the yard, which was later filled in, and they remained there until excavated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1974</TIMEX>.
The southern <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace courtyard</ENAMEX> includes wing F, which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Library</ENAMEX> and its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two million</NUMEX> books. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> is open to the public and temporary exhibitions are held in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>.
Through the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard arch</ENAMEX> is the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Palace</ENAMEX> area. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Recent History in Wing</ENAMEX> A stages some interesting ‚Äúeveryday life‚Äù exhibitions; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> can also enjoy views of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buda</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pest</ENAMEX>. Wings B, C, and D <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hungarian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Gallery</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Magyar Nemzeti Gal√©ria)¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†a huge undertaking spanning <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven centuries</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hungarian</ENAMEX> art. Don‚Äôt try to see it all in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> visit¬<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">†‚Äî¬†there</ENAMEX> are some Ô¨Åne works here, but it is too much for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX>. The gallery‚Äôs most popular sections are <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hungarian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Impressionism</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20th century</TIMEX> works (in Wings C and D). Contemporary art <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lovers</ENAMEX> are advised to head straight for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ludwig Collection</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX> A, which includes important figures in the contemporary art world, featuring several controversial works.
Obuda
Historically, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Obuda</ENAMEX> is the oldest quarter of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buda</ENAMEX>, centred on the site of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aquincum</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lower Pannonia</ENAMEX>. Nowadays it‚Äôs a nightmare of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>-planning, with heavy trafÔ¨Åc constantly rumbling past on the main northern <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">highway</ENAMEX> out of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Budapest</ENAMEX>. Amid this unlikely setting, however, there are some major <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> remains to be discovered.
To begin the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> route, take any number of city <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">buses</ENAMEX> north to the so-called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Military Amphitheatre</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Katonai AmÔ¨Åte√°trum</ENAMEX>), thus distinguishing it from a smaller <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> a short distance farther north. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gladiators</ENAMEX> performed here in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the second century</TIMEX> to amuse legionnaires. Completely forgotten for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX>, the ruins were only partially restored in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1930s</TIMEX>. Now it‚Äôs effectively a grassy piece of parkland where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locals</ENAMEX> play and walk their <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX>, but enough remains of the amphitheatre walls and outline to give a good idea of what it was once like.
Farther north, beneath the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Fl√≥ri√°n t√©r Ô¨Çyover</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buda</ENAMEX> side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Arp√°d Bridge</ENAMEX>, stand the ruins of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">baths</ENAMEX> built for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">legions</ENAMEX>. Take the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">walkway</ENAMEX> on the opposite side of the Ô¨Çyover from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">baths</ENAMEX> and you will catch the incongruous sight of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a dozen</NUMEX> isolated Corinthian columns with a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1960s</TIMEX> housing estate backdrop.
The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> and most important site is that of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aquincum</ENAMEX>, a civil <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> for the artisans, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">merchants</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priests</ENAMEX>, and other non-military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> attached to the legion. You can get here by bus, tram, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HEV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX>. Keep your eyes on the highway central reservation shortly before the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Aquincum</ENAMEX> stop, and you will see the remains of a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">aqueduct</ENAMEX>.
The site proper, which covers <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">several acres</NUMEX>, comprises the foundations of villas (including some Ô¨Çoor mosaics), workshops, and public areas, and there is another amphitheatre ruin on the other side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>. You will need more than a little imagination to re-enact the scene of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,600‚</NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Äì1,700 years ago</TIMEX> from the knee-high rubble, but you will Ô¨Ånd help in the small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> attached to the site. Here the best of the Ô¨Ånds are displayed here, and, at the entrance kiosk, there are guide-books in various languages. If you want to explore the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> connection farther, enquire at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aquincum</ENAMEX> about access to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hercules Villa</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meggyfa</ENAMEX> utca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX>.
But there is more to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Obuda</ENAMEX> than its <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> heritage. Between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fl√≥ri√</ENAMEX>°n t√©r and the river is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fot√©r</ENAMEX>, a small, picturesque cobbled square untouched by modern development. In this oasis you will Ô¨Ånd a fine old theatre, several pleasant <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">caf√©s</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">four Ô¨Årst</NUMEX>-class <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, and, just off the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> excellent small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum-galleries</ENAMEX>.
Even before you reach the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Imre Varga Museum</ENAMEX> (at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Laktanya</ENAMEX> utca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>), you‚Äôll <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> know what to expect because of the charming Ô¨Ågures with umbrellas standing by the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Varga</ENAMEX> is renowned as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hungary‚</ENAMEX>Äôs greatest living <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sculptor</ENAMEX>; whether his materials and subject matter are conventional (as is the case with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚ÄúUmbrellas‚Äù</ENAMEX>) or offbeat, as many of his works are, he manages to be accessible and very likeable.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vasarely Museum</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Szentl√©lek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">t√©r</ENAMEX> features Ô¨Årst-class <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Op Art</ENAMEX> (a style that exploits optical effects, characterized by cubes and spheres in bright, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">eye-popping</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">checker-board</ENAMEX> colours) by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Victor Vasarely</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pioneer</ENAMEX> of the movement.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buda Riverside</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hills</ENAMEX>
The stretch of riverside which is of most interest to visitors runs north from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Szabads√°g h√≠d</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Liberty Bridge</ENAMEX>). While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Castle Hill</ENAMEX> provides arguably the Ô¨Ånest views over the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Danube</ENAMEX>, there is another lookout point that also should not be missed. Gell√©rt-hegy (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gell√©rt Hill</ENAMEX>), which rises <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">some 140 metres</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">430 feet</NUMEX>) almost directly above the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Danube</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buda</ENAMEX> side, provides a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">marvellous panorama</ENAMEX>. It‚Äôs not well served by public transport, so give your legs some exercise, starting from the southern approach by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gell√©rt Hotel</ENAMEX>.
Almost immediately to your right you will see an extraordinary monument in the hillside, a cave converted into a chapel. It belongs to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Order of St. Paul</ENAMEX>, the only monastic body of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hungarian</ENAMEX> origin. Continue up the slope through the pleasant landscaped gardens of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Jubileumi Park</ENAMEX>, turn right onto the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>, and you will soon reach the summit.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Citadel</ENAMEX> crowning the hill was built by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Habsburgs</ENAMEX> after the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Revolution of 1848</ENAMEX> as a lookout point from which to control neighbouring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Castle Hill</ENAMEX>. It saw no action, however, until the end of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX>, when the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX> held out here. Since then the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Citadel</ENAMEX> has been renovated and now holds a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX>, caf√©, and budget <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX>.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Liberation Monument</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Szabadsag szobor</NUMEX>), visible from all parts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stands</ENAMEX> below the citadel. It was erected by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russians</ENAMEX> in honour of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> who fell while ‚Äúliberating‚Äù <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Budapest</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Germans</ENAMEX>. The monument is loathed by most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locals</ENAMEX> as a symbol of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> domination, but it has become too much of a city <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">landmark</ENAMEX> to remove.
Down at the base of the hill, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gell√©rt Hotel</ENAMEX> is the perfect place to recover from your walk. Behind this classic <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1918</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">white Art Nouveau</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> is a swimming pool <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> and the Ô¨Ånest thermal bath in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Buda</ENAMEX>. While the older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family members</ENAMEX> may wish to enjoy the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">restorative thermal waters</ENAMEX> and float at leisure in the beautiful indoor pool, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youngsters</ENAMEX> will most likely delight in the equally splendid landscaped outdoor pool.
There are some more <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">baths</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">f√ºrdo</ENAMEX>) with a wonderful atmosphere in which to relax just along the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buda</ENAMEX> embankment (rakpart) by the entrance to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Erzs√©bet h√≠d</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Elizabeth Bridge</ENAMEX>). The thermal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pools</ENAMEX> are restricted to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>, only. The entrance to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rudas</ENAMEX> f√ºrdo is rather shabby, and a knowledge of the language is deÔ¨Ånitely an advantage here, but after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">400 years</TIMEX> of serving the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locals</ENAMEX>, change comes slowly. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> has been much altered over the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX> but the atmosphere in the steamy main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pool</ENAMEX>, where a stone <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dome</ENAMEX> rises over an octagonal pool and sunbeams stream in through the star-shaped glass openings in the cupola, is magically ancient. 
The medicinal theme continues a little farther north at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Semmelweis Museum of the History of Medicine</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Semmelweis Orvost√∂rt√©neti M√∫zeum</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Professor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Semmelweis</ENAMEX>, who was born here in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1815</TIMEX>, discovered the cause of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">puerperal fever</ENAMEX> and thus became known as the ‚ÄúSaviour of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mothers</ENAMEX>.‚Äù The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> is a lively, sometimes gruesome, trawl through old instruments and techniques, some of which appear far worse than the condition they were intended to relieve. There is also a beautifully preserved old pharmacy shop dating back to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1813</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> the embankment is relieved by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arcades</ENAMEX>, terraces, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Neo</ENAMEX>-Classical statues, ceremonial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">staircases</ENAMEX>, and gateways (not open to the public) which lead up to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Palace</ENAMEX>. At this point it‚Äôs best to catch a bus or tram along the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fo</ENAMEX> utca, which becomes a canyon of trafÔ¨Åc noise, pollution, and exhaust fumes. Get off at the stop before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Batthy√</ENAMEX>°ny t√©r to admire the colourful exterior of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1896</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Neo-Gothic Calvinist Church</ENAMEX> which features in so many panoramas of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>.
Batthy√°ny t√©r is a major <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> where metro, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bus</ENAMEX>, tram, and suburban railway all meet. It is a bright, lively area, and offers a wonderful view of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Houses</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parliament</ENAMEX> directly across the river. The similarity to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">London‚</ENAMEX>Äôs own <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parliament</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Ben</ENAMEX> aside) is quite striking, with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Danube</ENAMEX> simply substituted for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thames</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vienna</ENAMEX> stagecoach <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terminal</ENAMEX> used to be just around the corner, and the once famous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White Cross Inn</ENAMEX>, on the opposite side of the square to the river, was the fashionable venue for balls and festivities. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">It‚Äôs</ENAMEX> still a grand old building even if its role has now diminished to that of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">nightclub</ENAMEX>, renamed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Casanova</ENAMEX> after the famous rake who reputedly stayed here. On the south side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Szent Anna</ENAMEX> templom (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Anne‚Äôs Church</ENAMEX>), a Ô¨Åne <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-18th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italianate</ENAMEX> inÔ¨Çuences.
Farther north along <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Fo</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">utca</ENAMEX> is another excellent example of a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> bath. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Kir√°ly f√ºrdo</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kir√°ly Baths</ENAMEX>) were established in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16th century</TIMEX>, and the authentic <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">section</ENAMEX> has survived, complete with an octagonal pool under the largest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dome</ENAMEX>. Apart from the steam bath, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> can use the bath tubs, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sauna</ENAMEX>, and several other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX>.
Turn left off <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frakel Le√≥ √∫t</ENAMEX> (the continuation of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Fo utca</NUMEX>) at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Margit h√≠d</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Margaret Bridge</ENAMEX>) and follow the signpost up the steps to another <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">memento</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">G√ºl Baba t√ºrb√©je</ENAMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tomb</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G√ºl Baba</ENAMEX>). This meticulously preserved <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mausoleum</ENAMEX> was built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-16th century</TIMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G√ºl Baba</ENAMEX>, a famous dervish killed during the siege of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buda</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1541</TIMEX> whose funeral was attended by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sultan</ENAMEX>. The interior, in keeping with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX> tradition, is quite simple, with the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tomb</ENAMEX> surrounded by carpets and a few artworks from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>. The hill on which the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tomb stands</ENAMEX>, called the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">R√≥zsadomb (‚ÄúHill of the Roses‚Äù</ENAMEX>), is one of the most exclusive addresses in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Budapest</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buda Hills</ENAMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Buda Hills</ENAMEX> area is a greenbelt that lies due west of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">R√≥zsadomb</ENAMEX>, though it stretches <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">as far</NUMEX> north as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Obuda</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">as far</NUMEX> south as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the start of the M7</TIMEX> highway. Choose a clear day, then catch any one of several trams or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">buses</ENAMEX> which go past the cog-railway <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terminus</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">just</NUMEX> west of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moszkva</ENAMEX> t√©r, opposite the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hotel Budapest</ENAMEX>). There is room on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX> for mountain <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bikes</ENAMEX> if you are feeling particularly active. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX> passes smart residential <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> on its way to the terminus and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sv√</ENAMEX>°b-hegy. A short walk across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> (just follow the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowds</ENAMEX>) is the stop for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Children‚Äôs Railway</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sz√©chenyi-hegyi Gyermekvas√∫t</ENAMEX>), thus named because it is operated almost entirely by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>; only the engine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drivers</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>.
This is an old narrow-gauge line which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traverses</ENAMEX> seemingly unspoiled <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">forests¬†‚Äî¬†but</ENAMEX> for the numerous walking <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">trails¬†‚Äî¬†and climbs</ENAMEX>, slowly, ever-upwards. At the Ô¨Årst stop, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Normafa</ENAMEX>, you‚Äôll find a ski-run, but unless it‚Äôs snowing stay on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX> until <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">J√</ENAMEX>°nos-hegy. It is a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10‚Äì15 minute</TIMEX> walk from here to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">J√</ENAMEX>°nos-hegy lookout <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX>, at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">529 metres</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,735 feet</NUMEX>) the highest point in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. If the horizon is not blurred by mist, there‚Äôs a splendid <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">360</NUMEX>-degree view for <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">mile upon mile</NUMEX>; you can also eat here.
On the way to the lookout tower you will have passed a chair-lift that goes down to a camping site. The views from the chair-lift are also spectacular, and the peace and quiet as you soar up and down the mountainside is quite extraordinary. Remember to note that the chairlift is closed on some <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mondays¬†‚Äî¬†check with Tourinform</ENAMEX>, or go on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">another day</TIMEX>. If you would prefer a speedy return to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, catch the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">158</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bus</ENAMEX> (to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Moszkva t√©r</NUMEX>) from near the bottom of the chair-lift.
Between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Banks</ENAMEX>
Just as <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Tower Bridge</ENAMEX> is the toast of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Golden Gate</ENAMEX> is the pride of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Brooklyn Bridge</ENAMEX> is a symbol of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Budapest</ENAMEX> too has its landmark <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">river crossings</ENAMEX>.
The most venerable of these is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sz√©chenyi L√°nch√≠d</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Chain Bridge</ENAMEX>, opened in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1849</TIMEX>, the Ô¨Årst <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">span</ENAMEX> to unite <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buda</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pest</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Count Istv√°n Sz√©chenyi</ENAMEX>, a great <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">innovator</ENAMEX> of his age, imported the technology and expertise of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Industrial Revolution</ENAMEX> to help <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hungary‚</ENAMEX>Äôs own reform programme. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX> was designed by an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineer</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Tierney Clark</ENAMEX>, and its construction was supervised by a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Scotsman</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adam Clark</ENAMEX> (no relation), who has a square named after him at the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Buda</ENAMEX> end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX>. Don‚Äôt miss the Ô¨Çoodlit view of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bridge¬†‚Äî¬†it‚</ENAMEX>Äôs one of the city‚Äôs Ô¨Ånest sights.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Chain Bridge</ENAMEX> is the rather more functional-looking <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Erzs√©bet h√≠d</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Elizabeth Bridge</ENAMEX>), named after the consort of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Franz Joseph</ENAMEX>, tragically assassinated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1898</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX>, opened in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1964</TIMEX>, is of modern design and works on the suspension principle.
Southwards from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Elizabeth Bridge</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Szabads√°g h√≠d</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Liberty Bridge</ENAMEX>) opened in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1896</TIMEX> and originally called the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Franz Joseph Bridge</ENAMEX>. It‚Äôs a handsome green iron <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">turul birds</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX>) perched on a golden ball balancing on each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pillar</ENAMEX>.
To the north of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Chain Bridge</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Margit h√≠d</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Margaret Bridge</ENAMEX>), a modern <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">replacement</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th-century</TIMEX> version destroyed in <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War</ENAMEX> II. Note the fine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stone</ENAMEX> carvings of nymphs, resembling ship‚Äôs Ô¨Ågureheads, on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge piers</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Margaret Island</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Margit-sziget</ENAMEX>)
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elite</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX> escaped everyday cares on this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">leafy oasis</ENAMEX> between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX>, and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later</TIMEX> eras princes and plutocrats did likewise. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> wealthy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> enjoy the thermal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> and treatments offered at the two international-class <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> on the island. The leisure establishment of most interest to visitors is the huge outdoor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palatinus Baths</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palatinus</ENAMEX> strand) which includes thermal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pools</ENAMEX> and boasts a capacity of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20,000</NUMEX> swimmers and sunbathers. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> is not just for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX>, however: Budapestis of all ages come here to walk, run, swim, play <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">tennis</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> games, or simply sunbathe. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">It‚Äôs</ENAMEX> also a famous spot for courting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couples</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">11‚ÅÑ2 miles</NUMEX>) long and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only a few hundred yards</NUMEX> at the widest part. Many of its estimated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> are now <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than a century old</TIMEX>, and large areas of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> are lawned and landscaped. Best of all, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> (with a few exceptions) are prohibited, thus preserving the island‚Äôs peace and quiet.
Alongside a landmark water <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> is a good open-air theatre which presents concerts, opera, and ballet performances in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX>. Nearby are the ruins of a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dominican Convent</ENAMEX> that was founded by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B√©la IV</ENAMEX>. Here he enrolled his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Margit</ENAMEX>, in fulÔ¨Ålment of a vow he had made should he live to survive the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mongol</ENAMEX> invasion. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Princess</ENAMEX> (and later saint) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Margit</ENAMEX> stayed on the island for the rest of her life; it was subsequently named after her. Her <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">burial place</ENAMEX> is marked by a marble plaque.
The other ruins close by include a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Franciscan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Church</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monastery</ENAMEX> built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 13th century</TIMEX>. The charming little <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Premonstratensian Chapel¬†‚Äî¬†a</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20th-century</TIMEX> reconstruction of the original <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">church¬†‚Äî¬†is</ENAMEX> still in use <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>. It houses a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15th-century</TIMEX> bell, the oldest in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hungary</ENAMEX>.
Pest
The bulk of modern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Budapest</ENAMEX> lies to the east of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Danube</ENAMEX> in what was, until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1873</TIMEX>, the autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pest</ENAMEX>. Here is the true pulse of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Budapest</ENAMEX>: large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX>, government <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>, shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>, nightlife, and thunderously busy boulevards.
From the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Romans‚</ENAMEX>Äô point of view, defending <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buda</ENAMEX> (and therefore western civilization) was a real headache. All they could do was stare across the great expanse of Ô¨Çat badlands to the east of the river and wait for the barbarians to arrive. So in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a.d. 294</TIMEX>, they decided to build a defence on the east side to make it harder for any invaders to establish a foothold here. They called the place <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Contra</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Aquincum</ENAMEX>; it is still at the core of the inner <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pest</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inner City</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Belv√°ros</ENAMEX>)
A <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">medieval town</ENAMEX> grew around the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> defence-post, evolving into a long, narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">strip</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Danube</ENAMEX> to the west and defensive walls on the other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">sides</ENAMEX>. The so-called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kis-k√∂r√∫t</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Little Boulevard</ENAMEX>) follows the line of the old walls and encloses the district of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Belv√°ros.</ENAMEX> (Note that you won‚Äôt Ô¨Ånd <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kis-k√∂r√∫t</ENAMEX> on any <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">map¬†‚Äî¬†it‚</ENAMEX>Äôs the aggregate of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">V√°mh√°z k√∂r√∫t</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M√</ENAMEX>∫zeum k√∂r√∫t, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K√</ENAMEX>°roly k√∂r√∫t, the southern end of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baj-csy-Zsilinszky √∫t</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">J√≥zsef Attila</ENAMEX> utca.)
The oldest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pest</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Belv√</ENAMEX>°rosi templom (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inner City Parish Church</ENAMEX>). The exterior is rather <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">unprepossessing¬†‚Äî¬†a sooty Baroque</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>, hemmed into an undigniÔ¨Åed position by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elizabeth Bridge¬†‚Äî¬†but</ENAMEX> look inside and you can discern much earlier elements in the handsome interior. It was founded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 12th century</TIMEX>, and some <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Romanesque</ENAMEX> construction is still visible. So, too, is the influence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turks</ENAMEX>, who turned the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> into a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX> and carved a mihrab (prayer niche) on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mecca</ENAMEX> side of the chancel wall. Next to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> is all that remains of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Contra</ENAMEX>-Aquincum¬<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">†‚Äî¬†an excavated square</ENAMEX> with benches and a small display of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tablets</ENAMEX> and reliefs found on the site.
The centrepiece of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pest‚</ENAMEX>Äôs pedestrian zone is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">V√</ENAMEX>°ci utca (pronounced Vah-tsee utsa), the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> place to visit for shopping in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. Here you will Ô¨Ånd the best fashion, art, cosmetics, books, and jewellery; the biggest and the best <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Folkart</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">78</NUMEX>); the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pest Sz√≠nh√°z</ENAMEX> (theatre) where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Franz Liszt</ENAMEX> made his <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> debut as a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pianist</ENAMEX>; various <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">airline offices</ENAMEX>, and several international <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>.
V√°ci utca runs into the ever-busy, yet somehow relaxed, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">V√∂r√∂smarty</ENAMEX> t√©r. This is one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pest‚</ENAMEX>Äôs favourite gathering places, often lined with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">craft</ENAMEX> stalls and resounding to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brass band</ENAMEX>. After a browse through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Luxus</ENAMEX> department store, it‚Äôs probably time for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX> and cakes at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gerbeaud</ENAMEX>, doyen of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Budapest‚Äôs coffee</ENAMEX>-house scene since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1884</TIMEX>. If the sumptuous high-ceilinged interior is a little too formal for your liking, then take a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terrace</ENAMEX> seat and watch the world go by.
Stroll <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a few yards</NUMEX> towards the river and you will come to yet another pleasant and lively <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vigad√≥</ENAMEX> t√©r, which has the advantage of a riverside location with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Castle Hill</ENAMEX> views. Here, too, you will find craft <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stalls</ENAMEX> and any number of buskers. A vibrant caf√©-restaurant comprises <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>, but the dominant <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> is the splendid <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Vigad√≥ theatre</ENAMEX>. The interior <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX> is an acoustically perfect auditorium renovated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1980</TIMEX> (its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">predecessors</ENAMEX> having twice perished in war and revolution), but the fa√ßade has been gloriously restored in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-19th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hungarian</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Eastern</ENAMEX> style. The list of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">performers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conductors</ENAMEX> who have graced the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Vigad√≥ theatre</ENAMEX> is an impressive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Who‚</ENAMEX>Äôs Who of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past 150 years</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> classical music: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Liszt</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brahms</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wagner</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mahler</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bart√≥k, ProkoÔ¨Åev, Casals, Bj√∂rling</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">von Karajan</ENAMEX>.
This is also the centre of what may be called <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">‚Äúthe Hotel Zone</ENAMEX>,‚Äù with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> luxury <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> within a very short distance of each other. Their architecture has done nothing for the aesthetics of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">embankment</ENAMEX> viewed from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buda</ENAMEX> side of the river, but, ironically, looking in the opposite direction, they provide some of the Ô¨Ånest views of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>.
From <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">V√∂r√∂smarty t√</NUMEX>©r take <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">De√°k Ferenc</ENAMEX> utca into busy <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">De√°k</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">t√©r</ENAMEX>. Just to the east of the pedestrianized <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">zone</ENAMEX> (across <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">PetoÔ¨Å S√</ENAMEX>°ndor utca) are a number of intriguing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX>. Next to the ordinary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lutheran Church</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Lutheran Museum</ENAMEX>, which houses a valuable collection including documents, bibles, and chalices. It chronicles the story of some of the distinguished <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Protestants</ENAMEX> influential in the history of this predominantly <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catholic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. As <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">De√</ENAMEX>°k t√©r is the only meeting point for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> metro lines, it‚Äôs an apt place for the tiny <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metro Museum</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAV M√∫zeum</ENAMEX>), located down in the pedestrian <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">subway</ENAMEX>. Here you can see the original <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX> that travelled on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Europe‚Äôs</ENAMEX> first continental underground <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">railway</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1896¬†‚</NUMEX>Äî¬†it‚Äôs hardly different to those on the current <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Millennium</ENAMEX> line.
Almost opposite the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lutheran Museum</ENAMEX>, next to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MacDonald‚Äôs</ENAMEX>, is the helpful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tourinform</ENAMEX> tourist information ofÔ¨Åce. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mustard</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> dominating the far side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Anker Palace</ENAMEX>, formerly an insurance company <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX>, and one of the very few <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> to escape <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX> unscathed.
Walk down <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Barczy utca</NUMEX>, which runs along the back of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lutheran Church</ENAMEX>, and, on your right, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Budapest City Hall</ENAMEX> Ô¨Ålls an entire <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>. It was built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1711</TIMEX> as a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">disabled soldiers</ENAMEX>, served for a time as an army <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">barracks</ENAMEX>, and became the town hall in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1894</TIMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">The 19th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Neo-Classical Pest County Hall</ENAMEX> lies a little farther beyond the bend in the same <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>.
Just off here is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Szervita</ENAMEX> t√©r, notable for a splendid patriotic-religious <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Art Nouveau</ENAMEX> mosaic fantasy. It occupies the very top of the old <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Banking House</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Head</ENAMEX> south along <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">PetoÔ¨Å S√°ndor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">utca</ENAMEX>; on your right is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P√°risi Udvar</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris Arcade</ENAMEX>), built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1909</TIMEX>. Inside, look up to enjoy the exotic <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Art Nouveau styling and glasswork</ENAMEX>; then walk round to see the stylish front of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>, where there is an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBUSZ</ENAMEX> tourist information ofÔ¨Åce.
Directly across the busy <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> (it‚Äôs best to use the underpass) are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> Ô¨Åne <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX> and part of the university <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>. On the corner of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ferenciek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tere</ENAMEX> stands the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Franciscan Church</ENAMEX>, constructed around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1758</TIMEX>. Look at the relief on the side <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wall</ENAMEX>, depicting the Ô¨Çood of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1838</TIMEX> that caused massive destruction in the entire inner <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. Then continue along <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">K√°rolyi Mih√°ly</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">utca</ENAMEX>, past the yellow <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University Library</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> on your left. On the opposite corner is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University Church</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Egyetemi templom</NUMEX>). Built <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1725 and 1742</TIMEX> by the monks of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Order of St. Paul</ENAMEX>, it features splendidly rich Baroque carving. Turn into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Szerb</ENAMEX> utca, where there are more university <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Serbian Church</ENAMEX> on this quiet street dates from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1688</TIMEX> and has a beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">interior</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Little Boulevard</ENAMEX>
Despite its diminutive name, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Little Boulevard</ENAMEX> is very big on trafÔ¨Åc; it is definitely not the place for a leisurely stroll. There are, however, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> major points of interest that fall just outside the inner city side of this notional dividing line.
The most popular of these among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locals</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Budapest</ENAMEX> Market <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Halls</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">V√°s√°rcsarnok</ENAMEX>) at the beginning of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">V√°mh√°z k√∂r√∫t</ENAMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Szabads√°g h√≠d</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Liberty Bridge</ENAMEX>). This vast, old-fashioned covered market is brimming with local colour and exotic smells. There is also a lively <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> market at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lehel</ENAMEX> t√©r, north of the inner <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lip√≥tv√°ros</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">district</ENAMEX> (take metro line <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Lehel t√©r</NUMEX>).
For <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>, the most popular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Little Boulevard</ENAMEX> attraction is the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hungarian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Museum</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Magyar Nemzeti M√∫zeum</ENAMEX>). This impressive structure, built in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Neo-Classical</ENAMEX> style with Corinthian columns and a sculptured tympanum, stands back off the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> in its own <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">big garden</ENAMEX>. Inside, amid monumental architectural and ornamental details, the whole story of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hungary</ENAMEX> unfolds. On display are prehistoric remains and ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jewels</ENAMEX> and tools, but there‚Äôs no doubt as to which is the main point of interest: just follow the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX> to the hushed <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">royal regalia</ENAMEX> resides.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crown</ENAMEX> is romantically associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">St.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen</ENAMEX>, the great <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX>, but is actually of a slightly <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later date</TIMEX> (the lower <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11th century</TIMEX>; the upper, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12th century</TIMEX>). The beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX>-threaded mantle, made in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1031</TIMEX>, is said to belong to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">St.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sceptre</ENAMEX> also dates from around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 12th century</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">It‚Äôs</ENAMEX> believed that both <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 14th-century</TIMEX> gilded orb and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">sword</ENAMEX> are replacements of the original regalia that was lost.
The exhibition <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">downstairs</ENAMEX>, which deals with the history of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Carpathian Basin</ENAMEX> from prehistoric times right up to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Conquest of 896</ENAMEX>, has some good <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">moments</TIMEX>, particularly when covering the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> period (it‚Äôs worthwhile buying a copy of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guide</ENAMEX> book, which costs <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">only a few forints</NUMEX>).
The exhibit upstairs, covering the period from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">896 to 1849</TIMEX>, is of more general interest than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the previous millennium</TIMEX>. A <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> tent decked out with carpets is one highlight, while other exhibits run the gamut of war and peace from suits of armour to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> reconstructions. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> also boasts a natural history section, but, compared to the riches of the rest of the collection, this is entirely optional viewing.
Back on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Little Boulevard</ENAMEX>, at the start of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Doh√</ENAMEX>°ny utca, is a striking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">synagogue</ENAMEX> of enormous proportions, built in a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Ô¨Çamboyant Byzantine</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moorish</ENAMEX> style. This is the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Central</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Great Synagogue</ENAMEX>, dating from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-19th century</TIMEX>, which is claimed by some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> to be the biggest in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, capable of holding up to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Visitors</ENAMEX> are allowed in (except during services) <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">between 10:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m.</TIMEX> to appreciate its quiet grandeur.
An interesting and informative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jewish Museum</ENAMEX> within the complex includes a moving exhibition about the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Hungarian Holocaust</ENAMEX>. Next door to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>, in a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">synagogue</ENAMEX>, is a metal weeping-willow, fashioned by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Imre Varga</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX>). Each leaf bears the name of a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Budapest</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> that perished in the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Holocaust</ENAMEX>. The site is deliberately chosen, being above the mass graves of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> executed by the fascist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arrow Cross</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> installed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nazis</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1944 and 1945</TIMEX>.
Lip√≥tv√°ros
Bounded by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jozs√©f Attila</ENAMEX> utca to the south and by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bajcsy-Zsilinszky</ENAMEX> √∫t to the east, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lip√≥tv√°ros</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Leopold Town</ENAMEX>) lies directly north of the inner <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Directions</ENAMEX> to find the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Basilica</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">St.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Szent Istv√°n Bazilika</ENAMEX>) aren‚Äôt needed, as its <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">96-metre</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">315-foot</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dome</ENAMEX> dominates the skyline. The biggest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Budapest</ENAMEX>, built <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1851 and 1905</TIMEX>, it is frequently full to its capacity of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8,500</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. Its exterior is in a poor <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, though slowly being restored. Before seeing the interior, ascend the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX>. It‚Äôs a long walk to the top, but you are rewarded with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pest‚</ENAMEX>Äôs highest viewpoint.
The interior of the basilica is dimly lit. There is an interesting main attraction in a reliquary in a rear chapel: the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Szent Jobb (‚ÄúHoly Right‚Äù</ENAMEX>) is the much revered holy relic of the right hand of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">St.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen</ENAMEX>; you‚Äôll need a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20-forint</NUMEX> piece to illuminate it.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Szabads√°g t√©r</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Freedom Square</ENAMEX>), a short walk to the north, is probably Pest‚Äôs Ô¨Ånest architectural ensemble. At its centre is an obelisk dedicated to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> who fell in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, but the enormous, ostentatious <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> surrounding the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> are what really steal the show. The superb lemon-coloured <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Art Nouveau</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> close to the obelisk is home to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Embassy</ENAMEX>. Next door is the former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> (now the country‚Äôs TV <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX>), a showy, eclectic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> with some good reliefs. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hungarian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Bank</ENAMEX> on the opposite side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> is the work of the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX>.
The great <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dome</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parliament</ENAMEX>, equal in height to that of the basilica, is clearly visible from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Houses</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parliament</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Orsz√°gh√°z</ENAMEX>) were built <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1885 and 1902</TIMEX> as a symbol of the grandeur of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Austro-Hungarian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX>. Its vital statistics are impressive: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">268</NUMEX> metres (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">879 feet</NUMEX>) long, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">691</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX>, and an estimated <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">12 miles</NUMEX>) of staircase inside. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX> may not have had <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">London‚Äôs Houses</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parliament</ENAMEX> in mind, but whatever his intentions, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Neo-Gothic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">arches</ENAMEX> and turrets rarely escape comparison with those of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Westminster</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Tourists</ENAMEX> are only admitted on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> excursions, and only to certain parts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">parliament</ENAMEX> is not in session; the visiting arrangements do vary from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year to year</TIMEX> (check with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tourinform</ENAMEX> as to the current situation). If you are admitted on a guided tour, you will probably be taken up the grandiose central stairway to a splendid <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>-sided domed <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX>, then into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lobby</ENAMEX>, and Ô¨Ånally into the principal debating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX>. (Look out for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brass</ENAMEX> rack where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">deputies</ENAMEX> leave their cigars before they enter the chamber.)
Across from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">parliament</ENAMEX> is the mighty <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ethnographic Museum</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N√©prajzi M√∫zeum</ENAMEX>), built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the same era</TIMEX>, occupying the former location of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court of Justice</ENAMEX>. It is worth a visit for the palatial interiors alone, but the exhibits here are also some of the most fascinating in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. Permanent displays show the fast-disappearing world of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hungarian</ENAMEX> rural life and folklore; these are underpinned by trenchant temporary exhibitions dealing with current issues, such as the lives of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Budapest‚</ENAMEX>Äôs gypsies.
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Andr√°ssy √∫t</ENAMEX>
The most attractive <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">avenue</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, modelled after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Champs-Elys√</ENAMEX>©es in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX>, was a bold stroke of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1870s</TIMEX>. Travelling straight as an arrow <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">almost 2.4 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">11‚ÅÑ2 miles</NUMEX>) from the inner <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">City Park</ENAMEX>, it is the site of some of the Ô¨Ånest architecture in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Budapest</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> that line it blend well, yet almost every one has a unique <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">feature¬†‚Äî¬†a fountain</ENAMEX>, a statue, a mosaic or a frieze, columns or arches. There‚Äôs a roomy, patrician feeling here, which belies the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">avenue‚Äôs past names¬†‚Äî¬†from the unpronounceable N√©pk√∂zt√°rsas√°g √∫tja</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">People‚Äôs Republic Avenue</ENAMEX>) to the prosaic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sug√°r √∫t</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Radial Road</ENAMEX>), to the hated <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stalin √∫t</ENAMEX>.
You can visit one of the typically large Ô¨Ån-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">de</ENAMEX>-si√®cle aristocratic homes right at the start of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">avenue</ENAMEX>, at number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, now home to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Museum</ENAMEX>. There are some colourful and interesting exhibits here (particularly the correspondence between <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Edison</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hungarian</ENAMEX> telecommunications <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pioneer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tivadar Pusk√°s</ENAMEX>), but the real attraction is the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> itself, particularly the stairway and balcony decorated with outstanding frescoes by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K√°roly Lotz</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Opera House</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Andr√°ssy √∫t 22</ENAMEX>), completed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1884</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mikl√≥s Ybl</ENAMEX>, is the most admired building on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">avenue</ENAMEX>. Its <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italianate</ENAMEX> style and restrained proportions Ô¨Åt in exquisitely with its surroundings. The splendidly opulent interior may be visited by guided tours, which are conducted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3:00 and 4:00 p.m.</TIMEX>, subject to performances. The architecture, atmosphere, and acoustics of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Opera House</ENAMEX> rank it among the very best in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>.
If you prefer entertainment of a slightly less highbrow nature, then continue north for a block to the area known as <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">‚ÄúBudapest‚Äôs Broadway</ENAMEX>,‚Äù where you will Ô¨Ånd several theatres and nightspots.
The cultural theme continues on the pedestrianized area of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Liszt Ferenc</ENAMEX> t√©r, where there is an excellent modern statue of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Liszt</ENAMEX> conducting in caricature with Ô¨Çailing hands and windswept hair. At the end of this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Academy of Music</ENAMEX>, completed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1907</TIMEX>. This is an <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Art Nouveau gem</ENAMEX>, from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fa√ßade¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†where the statue and name of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Liszt dominate¬†‚Äî¬†through</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lobby</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">interior</ENAMEX>. It is quite easy to get a look inside when there is no one playing.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cross</ENAMEX> the busy intersection of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oktogon</ENAMEX>, and three <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> north at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">V√∂r√∂smarty</ENAMEX> utca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ferenc Liszt Memorial Museum</ENAMEX>. This is a delightful small collection of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a few</NUMEX> pianos, memorabilia, and period furnishings, set in an <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX> where the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">composer</ENAMEX> once lived (closed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first three weeks of August</TIMEX>).
As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andr√°ssy √∫t</ENAMEX> heads farther away from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, the villas get noticeably grander and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansions</ENAMEX> in garden settings become predominant. Kod√°ly k√∂r√∂nd (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kod√°ly crescent</ENAMEX>, named after another <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hungarian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">composer</ENAMEX>) is a splendid ensemble, its curving fa√ßades decorated with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Classical Ô¨Ågures</ENAMEX> and inlaid motifs.
At number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">103</NUMEX> is another charming small collection in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum of East Asian Art</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hopp Ferenc Kelet-√°zsiai M√∫zeum</ENAMEX>), which rotates <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pieces</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ferenc Hopp‚Äôs</ENAMEX> collection comprising <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20,000</NUMEX> exotic items. A related <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum of Chinese Art</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K√≠na M√∫zeum</ENAMEX>), also known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Gy√∂rgy R√°th M√∫zeum</ENAMEX>, lies to the south of here, occupying a handsome <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Art Nouveau villa at V√</ENAMEX>°rosligeti fasor <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andr√°ssy √∫t</ENAMEX> ends in an outburst of pomp at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Heroes‚Äô Square</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Hos√∂k tere</NUMEX>), a huge open space housing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Millenary Monument</ENAMEX>, built on the thousandth anniversary of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Magyar</ENAMEX> conquest. Surmounting all is a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">36-metre</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">118-foot</NUMEX>) column supporting the Ô¨Ågure of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Archangel Gabriel</ENAMEX>, who, according to legend, appeared in a dream of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Stephen‚Äôs</ENAMEX> and offered him Hungary‚Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crown</ENAMEX>. Around the pedestal, on horseback, sit <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Prince Arp√°d</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Magyar</ENAMEX> tribal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chiefs</ENAMEX>, while Ô¨Çanking the column is a semi-circular colonnade with statues of historical Ô¨Ågures, starting with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen</ENAMEX>. In front of the statuary is the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Tomb of the Unknown Soldier</ENAMEX>.
Facing each other across <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Heroes‚Äô Square</ENAMEX> are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> large <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Neo-Classical</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> that are almost mirror images¬†‚Äî¬†not surprising, as they share the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX>. Undergoing long-term renovation, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> on the left is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum of Fine Arts</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sz√©pmuv√©szeti M√∫zeum</ENAMEX>), holding the city‚Äôs most highly regarded collection, which ranges from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Egyptian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mummies</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> relics (the latter collection is undergoing long-term restoration), through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> works, to a collection of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 2,500</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Old Masters</ENAMEX>, of which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 800</NUMEX> are on show at any one time. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> are all superbly represented. The latter is particularly notable, with masterpieces by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Greco</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goya</ENAMEX>, and several other famous names. There are also <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Flemish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX>. The favourite room for many, however, is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th-century</TIMEX> collection, including a treasure trove of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> Impressionist and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post-Impressionist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C√©zanne</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pisarro</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monet</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gaugin</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Renoir</ENAMEX>, among others. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">section</ENAMEX> on sculpture, and that on prints and drawings, features works by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leonardo da Vinci</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> also has a coffee <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop</ENAMEX> and a Ô¨Åne selection of art books and posters for sale. Free tours are given in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every weekday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10:30 a.m.</TIMEX>
Opposite the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum of Fine Arts</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mucsarnok</ENAMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>ÄúPalace of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Art‚Äù</ENAMEX> (a modern <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">art gallery</ENAMEX>), which mounts high-quality temporary exhibitions of the work of contemporary <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hungarian</ENAMEX> and foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Re</ENAMEX>-opened in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX> after undergoing renovations, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">gallery</ENAMEX> boasts the finest art bookstore in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Budapest</ENAMEX>, not to mention a beautiful exterior, with a splendid pediment mosaic of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">St.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen</ENAMEX> in his role as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patron saint</ENAMEX> of the arts. There is also a smaller sister <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">City Park</ENAMEX> (directions are posted on the front of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mucsarnok</ENAMEX>). 
City <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Park</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">V√°rosliget</ENAMEX>)
Beyond the pompous formality of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Heroes‚Äô Square</ENAMEX> and away from the noise and trafÔ¨Åc of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Andr√°ssy √∫t</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">City Park</ENAMEX> is a lovely green space where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Budapestis</ENAMEX> can relax, stroll, have a meal, hire a rowing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX>, go to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">zoo</ENAMEX>, or visit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>, which covers <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">some 101 hectares</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">250 acres</NUMEX>), began to evolve in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 19th century</TIMEX>, though many of the present amenities were added during preparations for the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Millennium festivities of 1896</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cross</ENAMEX> the bridge over the boating lake, which doubles as an ice-skating <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rink</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Castle of Vajdahunyad</ENAMEX>, behind the lake, was built as a prop for the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Millenary Exhibition</ENAMEX> but proved so popular that it was rebuilt in permanent form. It reproduces in convincing detail part of the exterior of the fairytale <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hunyadi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transylvania</ENAMEX>. Inside the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum of Hungarian Agriculture</ENAMEX>, housing a comprehensive collection that illustrates the history of hunting, fishing, and farming. If you want to see the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> at its best, return by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>, when it is beautifully illuminated. 
Within the grounds, there‚Äôs a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catholic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> with a splendid <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Romanesque</ENAMEX> portal (another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reconstruction</ENAMEX>) and one of the city‚Äôs favourite statues, which depicts the medieval <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chronicler</ENAMEX> who gave <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hungary</ENAMEX> its Ô¨Årst written records. Unfortunately, he didn‚Äôt leave us his name, so his face is hidden deep inside the cowl of his monk‚Äôs-style robe; he is referred to, simply, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anonymous</ENAMEX>. 
There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> more <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>, both towards its top right-hand corner. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum of Aviation and Space Travel</ENAMEX> occupies part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PetoÔ¨Å Csarnok</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PetoÔ¨Å Hall</ENAMEX>), the city <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youth</ENAMEX>-centre where rock concerts often take place, while you will find the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transport Museum</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K√∂zleked√©si M√∫zeum</ENAMEX>) on the perimeter path of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>. Both of these deal almost exclusively with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hungarian</ENAMEX> developments and are most likely to appeal to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>.
The jewel in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Sz√©chenyi Baths</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>, to the left of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> that bisects the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>. This is one of the largest medicinal bath <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>; it also provides year-round, open-air swimming, at a constant 27¬∞C (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">81¬∞F</NUMEX>), in beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">surroundings</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>, constructed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1909 and 1913</TIMEX> in a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Baroque Art Nouveau</ENAMEX> style, are topped by a series of huge green <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">domes</ENAMEX>. Inside the pool area the walls are ivy-clad and there is some sumptuous statuary, but even more interesting than the architecture of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">baths</ENAMEX> is the bizarre sight of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> playing chess while immersed in warm <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> (their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boards</ENAMEX> are supported on small jetties protruding into the pool).
Just behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">baths</ENAMEX> are the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">zoo</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> amusement <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX>. The zoo <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">welcomes visitors</ENAMEX> with an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Art Nouveau</ENAMEX> entrance decorated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">polar bears</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">elephants</ENAMEX>. It keeps a wide range of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, including most children‚Äôs and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">adults‚Äô favourite species</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> are mostly held in traditional cages, though renovations on several pavilions are in progress. Grown-ups may like to note that next to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">zoo</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gundel‚Äôs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX>, a legend in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Hungarian</ENAMEX> culinary circles.
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Vid√°m Park</ENAMEX>, next door, is an old-fashioned, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">funfair</TIMEX>-style amusement <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>. You won‚Äôt Ô¨Ånd American-style thrill rides here, just carousels, dodgem <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX>, a ferris wheel, and a few other low-technology sources of fun. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mini-</ENAMEX>version of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> more suited for younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> adjoins it. Next door to the amusement <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">circus</ENAMEX> makes regular appearances throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX>. For dates consult <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Programme</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">118</NUMEX>). 
If you want to return to downtown <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pest</ENAMEX>, but feel you have walked enough for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX>, take the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Millenium</ENAMEX> line metro, which runs the whole length of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Andr√°ssy √∫t</ENAMEX> (look for the antique yellow <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">‚ÄúF√∂ldalatti‚Äù signs</ENAMEX>). The quaint old-fashioned <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trains</ENAMEX> are a tourist attraction in their own right. Note that the trains run in the same direction as trafÔ¨Åc, and you must descend to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platform</ENAMEX> from the appropriate side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>; it is not possible to cross the lines once you are underground.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Great Boulevard</ENAMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Great Boulevard</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nagy-k√∂r√∫t</ENAMEX>) forms a long, sweeping arc from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Margaret Bridge</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">PetoÔ¨Å Bridge</ENAMEX>. It has, over the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX>, changed in name from <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Ferenc to J√≥zsef, to Erzs√©bet, to Ter√©z, and Ô¨Ånally to Szent Istv√°n</ENAMEX>; yet its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> remains consistent¬<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">†‚Äî¬†big</ENAMEX> and bustling. City <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planners</ENAMEX> approved the project and pushed it through during the landmark <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year of 1896</TIMEX>, when the volume of trafÔ¨Åc was considerably less than it is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> that line the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">boulevard</ENAMEX> are routinely <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> or more storeys high, many with ornate architectural touches.
The architectural pride of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Great Boulevard</ENAMEX> has to be the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum of Applied Arts</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iparmuv√©szeti M√∫zeum</ENAMEX>), just off Ferenc k√∂r√∫t at <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">33-37 √úlloi √∫t</NUMEX>. The exterior is a splendid example of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Art Nouveau</ENAMEX>, incorporating <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hungarian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folk</ENAMEX> art styles and using <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hungarian</ENAMEX> majolica tiles. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Great</ENAMEX> green cupolas, small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">spiky towers</ENAMEX>, a majolica lantern, and a bright green and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX> roof top the ensemble. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>, √ñd√∂n <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lechner</ENAMEX>, is regarded as the greatest exponent of this native form of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Art Nouveau</ENAMEX> style. The interior is, if anything, even more remarkable. The style itself may best be described as fantasy <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hungarian</ENAMEX> with strong <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Moorish</ENAMEX> inÔ¨Çuences. Shimmering white <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Arabian Nights</ENAMEX>-type arches, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">balconies</ENAMEX>, and swirling <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">staircases</ENAMEX> sweep up to a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Ô¨Åne Art Nouveau skylight</ENAMEX>. The main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX> is covered by a great expanse of glass supported by an iron frame, and ferns and potted <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> around the hall create an exotic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ambience</ENAMEX>.
A fascinating permanent exhibition, showing the progress of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">native</ENAMEX> arts and crafts techniques from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 12th century</TIMEX> onwards, is augmented by a variety of temporary exhibitions, which are usually of a very high quality, on more specialized subjects.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> of an altogether more restrained nature lies just beyond <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Erzs√©bet k√∂r√∫t</ENAMEX>, at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H√</ENAMEX>°rsfa utca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47</NUMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philatelic Museum</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B√©lyeg M√∫zeum</ENAMEX>) contains every stamp issued by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1871</TIMEX> onwards, and so provides its own miniature pictorial history of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>.
Ter√©z k√∂r√∫t and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Erzs√</ENAMEX>©bet k√∂r√∫t have traditionally been centres of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Budapest‚</ENAMEX>Äôs cultural, as well as its commercial, life. At the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Great Boulevard‚Äôs</ENAMEX> intersection with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Doh√</ENAMEX>°ny utca is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Caf√©</ENAMEX> (formerly known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hungaria</ENAMEX>). The caf√<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">©‚Äôs Neo-Baroque Art Nouveau</ENAMEX> interior, shining with polished <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wood</ENAMEX>, brass, and cut glass, has been restored to its original gaudy <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">glory¬†‚Äî¬†it</ENAMEX> looks the same as it did at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the beginning of the 20th century</TIMEX>. It is once again a meeting point for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actors</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalists</ENAMEX>. 
Excursions
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Danube Bend</ENAMEX>
Only <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a few miles</NUMEX> north of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Budapest</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Danube</ENAMEX> dramatically alters its easterly course for a southern tack. The prosaic name of this beautiful region is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dunakanyar</ENAMEX>, meaning <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Danube Bend</ENAMEX>. Here the river is at its most alluring, the countryside is lush and mostly unspoiled, and there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> delightful historic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> to explore.
Szentendre
Just <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">12 miles</NUMEX>) from central <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Budapest</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Szentendre</ENAMEX> is the most captivating of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Danube Bend</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">settlements</ENAMEX>. The easiest way to reach it is by the HEV suburban <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">railway</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Batthy√°ny t√©r</ENAMEX>. During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> make a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five-hour</TIMEX> journey all the way from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Budapest</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Esz-tergom</ENAMEX>, stopping en route at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Szentendre</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Visegr√°d.</ENAMEX> 
On your approach to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Szentendre</ENAMEX>, don‚Äôt be put off by the modern <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">suburbs¬†‚Äî¬†the heart</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> remains virtually locked in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 18th century</TIMEX>. Right at the centre is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fo</ENAMEX> t√©r, a picture-postcard cobblestone <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>. The iron rococo cross in the centre was erected in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1763</TIMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Serbian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> (in gratitude for being spared by the plague) and the majestic <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Serbian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> on the hill is the town‚Äôs most prominent landmark.
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Serbian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">refugees</ENAMEX> twice settled here in the wake of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> invasions: <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 13th century</TIMEX>, and then again in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1690</TIMEX>. On the latter occasion, around <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Serbs</ENAMEX> brought their religion, art, architecture, trades and crafts, and commercial acumen to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Szentendre</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blagovestenska Eastern Orthodox</ENAMEX>, is known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Church</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">refugees</ENAMEX> also Ô¨Çed here), even though it, too, is <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Serbian</ENAMEX>. Built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-18th century</TIMEX>, its interior is a little <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gem</ENAMEX>, with a collection of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Serb</ENAMEX>-painted icons well worth seeing.
On <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>, in what used to be an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">schoolhouse</ENAMEX>, you will find the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ferenczy Museum</ENAMEX>, displaying works by the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Hungarian Impressionist K√°roly Ferenczy</ENAMEX> and his <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>. Another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>, on the opposite side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>, conÔ¨Årms <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Szentendre‚Äôs</ENAMEX> status as an important artists‚Äô <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Margit Kov√°cs Museum</ENAMEX> is the former <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> and workshop of ceramicist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Margit Kov√°cs</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1907‚Äì1977</ENAMEX>), unknown outside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hungary</ENAMEX> but worthy of an international <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX>. Inside there are attenuated sculptures of wide-eyed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">damsels</TIMEX>, poignant religious icons, and ‚Äúordinary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>,‚Äù stooped and tragic, bearing the whole weight of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hungary‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20th-century</TIMEX> misfortunes.
The rust-red, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-18th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Serbian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> on the hill is only open for services, but in its grounds is the excellent Collection of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Serbian Ecclesiastical Art</ENAMEX>, displaying precious <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carvings</ENAMEX>, icons, and manuscripts. The oldest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> lies just above here on top of the hill, affording a perfect vantage point from which to peer down into the tiny gardens and courtyards and across the town‚Äôs venerable rooftops.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catholic</ENAMEX> parish <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> dates mostly from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 13th century</TIMEX>, though parts of it go back to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 11th century</TIMEX>. During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> and early <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">autumn</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">craft</ENAMEX> and souvenir <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stalls congregate</ENAMEX> around here. 
Opposite the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> is another good local artist‚Äôs collection, that of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Impressionist B√©la Cz√≥bel</ENAMEX>. You will Ô¨Ånd much more art on display in town, but don‚Äôt miss the modern art in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Barcsay Collection</ENAMEX> (on the road out to the bus and railway <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX>).
If you want a change from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">galleries</ENAMEX>, a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4-km</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">21‚ÅÑ2-mile</NUMEX>) trip out of town brings you to a great place for historic films, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hungarian Open Air Village Museum</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sza-badt√©ri N√©prajzi M√∫zeum</ENAMEX>), which is an offshoot of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ethnographical Museum</ENAMEX>. Catch the number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bus</ENAMEX> departing from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terminal</ENAMEX> next to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HEV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX>, and ask for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚ÄúSkanzen</ENAMEX>.‚Äù There are also regular <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">buses</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tourinform</ENAMEX> ofÔ¨Åce, on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> from the bus <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX> to the centre.
The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46</NUMEX>-hectare (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">115-acre</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> site will eventually contain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> ‚Äúvillages‚Äù of real <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mills</ENAMEX>, farm <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>, workshops, and smithys, dating mostly from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 18th</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 20th century</TIMEX>, and culled from all over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hungary</ENAMEX>. At present there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only three</NUMEX> settlements to view, but even these will occupy you for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least half</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a day</TIMEX> and possibly longer. It is a fascinating and picturesque simulation of old rural <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hungary</ENAMEX>, brought to life by active craftspeople, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">gingerbread</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">makers</ENAMEX>, and other ‚Äúrural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folk</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù</ENAMEX> (Try to come on the Ô¨Årst or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">third Sunday of the month</TIMEX>, when there are several different <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">craft</ENAMEX> demonstrations.) An excellent guide book giving the general history of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>, and details about individual interiors, is available for purchase. 
Don‚Äôt miss climbing up the hill to visit the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catholic Church</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M√°ndok</ENAMEX> (in northeast <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hungary</ENAMEX>), originally built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1670</TIMEX>, and boasting a painted iconostasis. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> is closed from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX>.
Visegr√°d
Farther up the river, where the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Danube</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bends</ENAMEX>, lies <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Visegr√°d.</ENAMEX> You can get here by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bus</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Szentendre</ENAMEX>. This is one of the most picturesque sections of the river, where verdant hillsides roll down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost</NUMEX> to the water‚Äôs edge. The Ô¨Ånest place to enjoy the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">views¬†‚Äî¬†reminiscent</ENAMEX> of the best of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rhine¬†‚Äî¬†are</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Citadel</ENAMEX>, high on a hill above the ruins of the old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Visegr√°d</ENAMEX> (which means ‚Äúhigh castle‚Äù in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Slavic</ENAMEX>).
The strategic value of a site commanding the river bend has been recognized since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fourth century</TIMEX>, when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Romans</ENAMEX> built a fort here. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 14th century</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Angevin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">kings</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hungary</ENAMEX> built a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> on the site, each monarch adding new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> and more opulence until the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">establishment</ENAMEX> covered an area now estimated at some <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">18 hectares</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">44 acres</NUMEX>). By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the 15th century</TIMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">King M√°ty√°s</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>) was <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">resident</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX>, like his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">grand Buda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX>, was famous all over <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> rather unwilling and notorious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">resident</ENAMEX> was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monstrous Vlad the Impaler</ENAMEX> (on whom the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Dracula</ENAMEX> legend was partly based), held <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prisoner</ENAMEX> here <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">from 1462 to 1475</TIMEX>.
Like <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">King M√°ty√°s‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Palace</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Buda</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Visegr√°d</ENAMEX> fell into ruins in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">occupation</ENAMEX> and was completely forgotten. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Excavations</ENAMEX> began in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1930</TIMEX>; part of the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> has been unearthed and certain parts have been rebuilt (using obviously new materials to differentiate these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX> from the original ones). Among the best of the discoveries are the superb <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hercules Fountain</ENAMEX> (a rare vestige of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hungarian Renaissance</ENAMEX> architecture), the vaulted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">galleries</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Court of Honour</ENAMEX>, and the restored <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lion‚Äôs Fountain</ENAMEX>. On the hillside, the hexagonal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX>, known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Tower of Solomon</ENAMEX>, is now a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX>. Topping it all is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Citadel</ENAMEX>, which was once considered so impregnable that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hungarian</ENAMEX> crown <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jewels</ENAMEX> were kept here.
Esztergom
The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Danube Bend</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Esztergom</ENAMEX>, situated a farther <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">12 miles</NUMEX>) upriver, is linked by hydrofoil to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Budapest</ENAMEX>, and by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bus</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Szentendre</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Visegr√°d.</ENAMEX> Take the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> if you have <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two hours</TIMEX> to spare, as the river‚Äôs most scenic stretch lies between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Visegr√°d</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Esztergom</ENAMEX>. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">King Stephen</ENAMEX> was born in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Esztergom</ENAMEX>, during his time the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">medieval capital</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hungary</ENAMEX>. It is still the religious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">centre</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, boasting the largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> in the land. The towering <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">basilica</ENAMEX> stands on the site of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">an 11th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen</ENAMEX> was crowned as the Ô¨Årst <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hungary</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year 1000</TIMEX>. This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> was destroyed in the struggle with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turks</ENAMEX>, and, for all its massive dimensions (or perhaps because of its size), the only part of the current structure that generates an ancient atmosphere is the rather spooky crypt.
The most valuable part of the basilica is the red-marble side chapel called the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Bak√≥cz-k√°polna¬†‚Äî¬†a</ENAMEX> pure example of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> style. Built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16th century</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">chapel</ENAMEX>, taken from the ruins around it and reassembled in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th century</TIMEX>, is all that survives of the original basilica. Note the white marble altar, which was sculpted by a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Florentine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">master</ENAMEX>.
Don‚Äôt miss climbing the stairs of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Basilica</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> more highlights. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">treasury</ENAMEX> contains what purports to be <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hungary‚</ENAMEX>Äôs richest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX> of religious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX>, including a crystal cross from the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">ninth</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">century</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 15th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Calvary of King M√°ty√°s</ENAMEX>. From priceless treasures, ascend the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> for a priceless view. As well as looking down over the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, you can also see across into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Slovakia</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Danube</ENAMEX> forms a natural boundary; the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX> that up until <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War I</ENAMEX> linked the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> was symbolically left in ruins. It‚Äôs a melancholy sight that recalls <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hungary‚</ENAMEX>Äôs claim on that part of the land north of the river, lost in the punitive <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1920</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Treaty of Trianon</ENAMEX>. Those interested can cross over by ferry at this point. (Note that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">treasury</ENAMEX> as well as the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> are closed from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX>.)
Alongside the basilica, the remains of a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">medieval royal palace</ENAMEX> have been excavated and restored, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> house the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Castle Museum</ENAMEX>. Among the highlights in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">St. Stephen‚Äôs Hall</ENAMEX>, the frescoed <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hall of Virtues</ENAMEX> (listed as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudence</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Temperance</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fortitude</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice</ENAMEX>), and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 12th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Royal Chapel</ENAMEX>.
The most popular collection in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Esztergom</ENAMEX> lies at the foot of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Basilica Hill</ENAMEX> at the riverside. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Christian Museum</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kereszt√©ny M√∫zeum</ENAMEX>), with the most important provincial collection in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hungary</ENAMEX>, is the best religious art <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. Covering mostly the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gothic</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> periods from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 13th</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16th centuries</TIMEX>, it has some very good <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14th- and 15th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> paintings. Look out, as well, for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 15th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">CofÔ¨Ån of Garamszentbenedek</ENAMEX>, an intricately carved and painted devotional <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicle</ENAMEX>, previously paraded in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Easter</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lake</ENAMEX> Balaton
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hungary</ENAMEX> may be deprived of a coastline, but in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lake Balaton</ENAMEX>, a freshwater haven surrounded by verdant hills, fertile plains, orchards, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">vineyards</ENAMEX>, and historic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX>, they have the next best thing. The northwest tip of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Balaton</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">around 100 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">60 miles</NUMEX>) from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Budapest</ENAMEX>, lying within an easy and comfortable day-trip of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">Buses</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trains</ENAMEX> serve the lake, and coach excursions visit here in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Balaton</ENAMEX> is the biggest lake in central and western <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, measuring <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">77 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">48 miles</NUMEX>) across, with an area of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly 600</NUMEX> km2 (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">230 square miles</NUMEX>). Yet its average depth is <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">less than 3 metres</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 feet</NUMEX>); in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> it freezes over completely, while in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> the shallow <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> is subject to wind-driven waves, and when a storm blows up even the ferries call it a day.
However, for most of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX>, the hot sun warms the tranquil lake almost up to air temperature, luring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">swimmers</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> into the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>. What‚Äôs more, the mildly alkaline <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> is said to be positively healthy for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bathing¬†‚Äî¬†a</ENAMEX> claim that few seaside <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX> can make in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these days</TIMEX> of polluted shores. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Balaton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> also ensure that the lake is kept clean and calm by banning <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">motor boats</ENAMEX> (with exceptions that require special permits).
If the Ô¨Åsh are a barometer of a lake‚Äôs health, all would appear to be hazard free: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 40</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> thrive in it. Balaton pike-perch (fogas) is usually singled out as the tastiest of all. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Fishermen</ENAMEX> operate from shore, from <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX>, and from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platforms</ENAMEX> set a little distance into the lake. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Ice-Ô¨Åshing</ENAMEX> has been popular since the earliest times, when <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> was the only season in which the catch could be preserved and sold in distant parts of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hungary</ENAMEX>. The frozen lake is also used by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice yachtsmen</ENAMEX>, whose wind-powered <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> skate at hair-raising speeds across the frozen lake.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agriculture Ô¨Çourishes</ENAMEX> all along the circumference of the lake, enhancing the area with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>, rippling expanses of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wheat</ENAMEX>, and, in the area of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Badacsony</ENAMEX>, some of the best <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">vineyards</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hungary</ENAMEX>.
The north and south shores of the lake have their own distinct personalities. The north shore shelves quicker and, in many places, is less suited to bathing than the southern shore. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">north</ENAMEX> is backed by hills, greenery, and quaint <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX>; the south is Ô¨Çatter and has extensive tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX>, perfect for the more hedonistic holiday-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">maker</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">North Shore</ENAMEX>
Driving from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Budapest</ENAMEX> and navigating the lake in an counter-clockwise direction (along the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">perimeter Highway 71</ENAMEX>), the Ô¨Årst settlement of any size is at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Balatonalm√°di.</ENAMEX> There is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">medieval chapel</ENAMEX> in the parish <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>, but most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> come here to enjoy the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">beach¬†‚Äî¬†the</ENAMEX> biggest and one of the best-equipped along the northern shore, with space for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12,000</NUMEX> sunbathing bodies. Signs for the beach read strand, but that won‚Äôt guarantee you a sandy or even pebbly <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">foreshore¬†‚Äî¬†it</ENAMEX> simply means the lake edge, which may be sand, <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">lawn</ENAMEX>, or even concrete.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Balatonf√ºred</ENAMEX>, some <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">13 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">8 miles</NUMEX>) farther west, has a history as a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">spa</ENAMEX> stretching back to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> times. The main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>, called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Gy√≥gy t√©r</ENAMEX> (meaning <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Health/Therapeutic Square</ENAMEX>), is a handsome place where the local mineral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> bubbles up from the ground beneath a pagoda-like well-head. On <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sides</ENAMEX> of the square stand grand old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>: <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 18th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Horv√°th House</ENAMEX>, once an inn, now a miner‚Äôs sanatorium; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trade Union Sanatorium</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1802</TIMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cardiac Hospital</ENAMEX>, which has treated <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> from all over the world. The small <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">grove</ENAMEX> in front of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> has a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> dedicated by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personalities</ENAMEX> who have visited here, including <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Indira Gandhi</ENAMEX>.
Just off the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blaha Lujza</ENAMEX> utca, with a <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Ô¨Åne 1867 villa.</ENAMEX> On the opposite side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> is the best <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> on the lake: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kedves</ENAMEX> has been going strong for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two centuries</TIMEX> and once you‚Äôve tasted their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chocolate cake you‚</ENAMEX>Äôll understand why. At the end of this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> is a rotund <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1840s</TIMEX>, and a small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hungarian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M√≥r J√≥kai</ENAMEX> (closed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February</TIMEX>). It is not all cures, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX>, and culture here: Balatonf√ºred is also one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lake‚Äôs liveliest resorts</ENAMEX>, bustling by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX> and night.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the most attractive spots on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lake Balaton</ENAMEX> is the village of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tihany</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">place</ENAMEX> gives its name to a peninsula which almost cuts the lake in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two and ends</TIMEX> at the ferry point of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tihanyi-r√©v</ENAMEX>, where there is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Club Med</ENAMEX>-style <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camp</ENAMEX> and hotel offering a gamut of entertainment. The peninsula is unspoiled and protected by its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">National Park</ENAMEX> status. It even has its own small lake, popular with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bird</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">watchers</ENAMEX> and nature <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lovers</ENAMEX>. To the south are the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">domes</ENAMEX> of former geysers.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tihany</ENAMEX> is built high on a hill above the main lake, and its principal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pisky s√©t√°ny</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a promenade</NUMEX>), has a few charming traditional thatched <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>. Start your tour of the village below this point at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abbey Church</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ap√°ts√°g</ENAMEX>), which stands just off the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>. The present <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Baroque</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> stands over an atmospheric crypt <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">almost a thousand years old</TIMEX>. A rare <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">survivor</ENAMEX> in a land constantly ravaged by so many invasions, it is claimed to be the oldest in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hungary</ENAMEX>. Here you will Ô¨Ånd the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tomb</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andr√°s</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Andrew</ENAMEX>) I who, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1055</TIMEX>, founded the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Benedictine Abbey</ENAMEX> that once stood on this site. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> itself is being renovated at present, but even through the tarpaulins you can glimpse its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rich Baroque carvings</ENAMEX> and decorative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ornamentation</ENAMEX>.
Next door to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abbey Church</ENAMEX>, housed in the old priory, is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tihany Historical Museum</ENAMEX> (closed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February</TIMEX>). This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> features regional folk items and art, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hungary‚Äôs</ENAMEX> last <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">K√°roly IV</ENAMEX>, lived for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Ô¨Åve</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1921</TIMEX>, and, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">basement</ENAMEX>, an atmospheric lapidarium containing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> remains. In front of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andr√</ENAMEX>°s is commemorated in a typically offbeat <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Imre Varga</ENAMEX> statue, wrapped in an aluminium cloak.
Some of the quaint thatched white <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> that run along <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Pisky</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">s√©t√°ny</ENAMEX> have been converted into an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ethnography Museum</ENAMEX> (similar to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Szentendre</ENAMEX>, see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">64</NUMEX>, but on a much smaller scale). In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fishermen‚Äôs House</ENAMEX>, for example, you can see canoes and Ô¨Åshing equipment used on the lake until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1930s</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> closed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX>).
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">promenade</ENAMEX> overlooking the lake passes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">craft</ENAMEX> and souvenir <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> before it ends at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Echo Hill</ENAMEX>, where the views are Ô¨Åne, even if the reverberations you hear aren‚Äôt what they used to be. A marked path continues to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">√≥v√°r¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†not an old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX>, as the name suggests, but a volcanic outcrop dotted with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> made by monks.
The name of the region of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Badacsony</ENAMEX> is as inextricably linked with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hungary‚Äôs</ENAMEX> wine industry as that of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Burgundy</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beaujolais</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>. Apart from the opportunity to sample the local tipple, it‚Äôs the scenery that appeals to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> here; the region‚Äôs volcanic past is evident at Ô¨Årst sight of the conical green hills. The central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">basalt</ENAMEX> peak, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mount Badacsony</ENAMEX>, the biggest of all the extinct volcanoes at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">437 metres</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1434 feet</NUMEX>), is invariably described as ‚ÄúcofÔ¨Ån-shaped.‚Äù The basalt ‚Äúorgan-pipes‚Äù of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Szentgy√∂rgyhegy</ENAMEX> are an especially Ô¨Åne sight. If you are feeling fit and energetic you can hike up these hills, but the easy way is by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>, or by a jeep that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">shuttles</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> to and from the bottom of the hill to the wine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum houses</ENAMEX>, as well as scenic points of interest. 
A little way farther west, set off the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>, is the small settlement of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Szigliget</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">moody</ENAMEX> remains of a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> offer Ô¨Åne views of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> and lake.
The last <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> on the north shore, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keszthely</ENAMEX> (pronounced kest-hey), was once owned entirely by the wealthy <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Festetics</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, and their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> is one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hungary‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most important Baroque monuments (open <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all year</TIMEX> round). Here, among a selection of its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">101</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX>, you can see something of the aristocratic life the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> enjoyed during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 18th and 19th centuries</TIMEX>. The highlight is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Helikon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX>, claimed to be the greatest in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, and it alone is worth the palace entrance charge (which is hefty by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hungarian</ENAMEX> standards).
A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hungary‚</ENAMEX>Äôs dynasty, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Count Gy√∂rgy Festetics</ENAMEX>, founded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Europe‚</ENAMEX>Äôs Ô¨Årst agricultural <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> here in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1797</TIMEX>, which is now the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Keszthely University of Agricultural Sciences</ENAMEX>. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> situated on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bercs√</ENAMEX>©nyi utca preserves the memory of early local farming methods and equipment. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">university</ENAMEX> gives the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> another focus other than tourism, something unique among the lakeside settlements, and as a by-product there is a good selection of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bars</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>.
Continuing out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Keszthely</ENAMEX> to the southwest on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Highway 71</ENAMEX>, you reach another good historical collection. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Balaton Museum</ENAMEX> portrays the story of the settlement of the lake and the development of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, including their agriculture and Ô¨Åshing and its <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fauna</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flora</ENAMEX>, in a lively exhibition.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South Shore</ENAMEX>
Just off the southwest corner of the lake lies <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kis-Balaton</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Little Balaton</ENAMEX>), a marshy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Reserve</ENAMEX> noted for its rare birdlife. Observation <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">towers</ENAMEX> are provided for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">watchers</ENAMEX>. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fony√≥d</ENAMEX> ranks as the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> largest of the south shore <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX>, and ferries run from here to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Badacsony</ENAMEX>. A better place to stay might be <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Balatonf√∂ldv√°r</ENAMEX>, arguably the area‚Äôs most attractive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX>, well-landscaped around <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX> and gardens.
At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sz√°nt√≥d</ENAMEX>, the lake is squeezed to its narrowest point by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Tihany</ENAMEX> peninsula. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">Cars</ENAMEX> invariably queue here to make the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">ten-minute</TIMEX> crossing to the north shore. On the other side of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Highway 70</ENAMEX>, almost due south of the ferry point, is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sz√°nt√≥dpuszta.</ENAMEX> Traditional life on the country‚<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Äôs Great Plain</ENAMEX> (the puszta) is evoked through <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 30</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> dating from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 18th and 19th centuries</TIMEX>, including a few <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">farm buildings</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>, and a cs√°rda (rustic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX>). Displays of horsemanship, craftsmanship, and other rural activities are given regularly.
The largest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">lake‚Äôs</ENAMEX> south coast is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Si√≥fok</ENAMEX>. This fairly popular tourist spot boasts a strand which holds <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of sunbathers and lively nightlife. Pleasure craft depart from the large harbour, but the most pleasant stretch of waterfront is the gardens immediately east of the port. Continuing eastwards, just before the hotel <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">zone</ENAMEX>, is the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town centre</ENAMEX>, which has a small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>.
