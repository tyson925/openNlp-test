What to Do
S ome <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> visit <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Budapest</ENAMEX> to pursue a special interest and happily spend their holiday in thermal pools amidst ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> remains. For the less single-minded there is a wide range of activities; from high culture to late-night bars, and from sports to folk dancing. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>, especially those who have been here before, may want to experience <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Budapest</ENAMEX> as a native by visiting <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the smaller steam <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">baths</ENAMEX> used by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locals</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horse</ENAMEX> riding on the puszta (plain), or bargaining for old <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> memorabilia at the Ô¨Çea-market.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shopping</ENAMEX>
Not very long ago, a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">fistful of dollars</NUMEX> would have given you the freedom of most <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Budapest</ENAMEX> shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>. The end of communism, the imposition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VAT</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16 percent</NUMEX>, and the effect of inÔ¨Çation have, however, brought an end to those bargain-basement <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>. As ever, artisans provide the bulk of the best buys, but it is worth bearing in mind that their hand-produced items can‚Äôt compete with the price of the mass-produced <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substitutes</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Far East</ENAMEX>. If something is extremely cheap, chances are that it‚Äôs a clever imitation.
Where to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shop</ENAMEX>
The former ‚ÄúIntourist‚Äù <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> which only took <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUFand</ENAMEX> had a virtual monopoly on quality souvenirs have been consigned to the same scrap heap as the statues of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stalin</ENAMEX>. You can now buy most Western goods in the city‚Äôs department <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX>, at any number of specialist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, and on market stalls; in fact, at all the usual retail <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outlets</ENAMEX>. Prices are nearly always Ô¨Åxed.
Any shopping foray should start on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">V√</ENAMEX>°ci utca, the most comprehensive and best quality shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Budapest</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46</NUMEX>). Here you will Ô¨Ånd a selection of clothes, fashion accessories, shoes, jewellery, antiques, books, music, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">china</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glass</ENAMEX>, and much more.
If you are looking for folk items, start at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Folkart Centrum</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">V√</ENAMEX>°ci utca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>. This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX>, the biggest and best of a small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outlets</ENAMEX>, is open <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX>. You will also Ô¨Ånd folk goods sold at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stalls</ENAMEX> around <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">V√∂r√∂smarty t√©r and Vigad√≥ t√©r</NUMEX>. The grocery <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Open Air Village Museum</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Szent-endre</ENAMEX> is another good place to buy real artisan products.
The complimentary <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazines</ENAMEX>, Where <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Budapest</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Budapest Panorama</ENAMEX>, feature shop listings. Ask <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tourinform</ENAMEX> for details of the city‚Äôs markets and about the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ferenc</ENAMEX>-v√°ros Ô¨Çea-market.
What to Buy
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ceramics</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> leading brands are <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herend</ENAMEX>, which is made in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of the same name near <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lake Balaton</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zsolnay</ENAMEX>, made in the south of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hungary</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Herend</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factory</ENAMEX> has been turning out <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">porcelain</ENAMEX> for the tables of the nobility since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1826</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> royal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Queen Victoria to Charles</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diana</ENAMEX> have been <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX>. As everything is still hand-Ô¨Ånished, prices are understandably high. You don‚Äôt need to travel all the way to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Herend</ENAMEX> to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Herend</ENAMEX> ceramics, as there is a specialist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">J√≥zsef N√°dor t√©r</ENAMEX> (behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Gerbeaud caf√© on V√∂r√∂smarty t√©r</ENAMEX>).
More affordable folk-style plates and vases are common. If you want something distinctive, look for the blue-and-white ware (on sale at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tihany</ENAMEX>) or the local charcoal-coloured work.
Chess sets. There are some beautiful gift sets available for purchase in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Budapest</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pawns</ENAMEX> as footsoldiers and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">knights</ENAMEX> as hussars in bright <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">garb</ENAMEX> are but <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> variation.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Elixirs</ENAMEX> and novelties. They say some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreigners</ENAMEX> used to Ô¨Çy to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hungary</ENAMEX> just to buy bottles of the wonder cure <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">B√©res Csepp</ENAMEX>; you may still Ô¨Ånd it at some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pharmacies</ENAMEX>. There is another miracle <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocktail</ENAMEX> for sale outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Church of Tihany</ENAMEX>. 
How about a tin containing ‚ÄúCommunism‚Äôs last breath?‚Äù You will Ô¨Ånd it on sale at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vajdahunyad Castle</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Citadel</ENAMEX>, and all good joke <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Food</ENAMEX> and drink. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paprika</ENAMEX> in small gift boxes or sachets, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">strudels</ENAMEX> packed in sturdy cardboard boxes, salami, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hungarian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wines</ENAMEX> (particularly <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokay</ENAMEX>), and liqueurs (particularly apricot <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">brandy</ENAMEX>) are popular gifts, selling at half the price, or less, than elsewhere in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>.
Leather goods. There is plenty of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hungarian</ENAMEX> kitsch to take home, including <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">leather wine</ENAMEX>-bottle covers and cowboy whips from the puszta. More seriously, handbags, gloves, and wallets are sold at reasonable, but not bargain prices.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Russian</ENAMEX> dolls. Hardly <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hungarian</ENAMEX>, but a good, solid symbol of old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eastern</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Central Europe</ENAMEX>. If you buy the popular <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> doll, you get a miniature history lesson to boot: hidden inside <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeltsin</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX>, inside <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andropov</ENAMEX>, and so on. This type is quite expensive.
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX> memorabilia. These include fur hats, steel helmets, cap and other badges, and watches. You‚Äôll Ô¨Ånd these at most markets and alongside craft <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stalls</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Textiles</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Embroidered</ENAMEX> and handspun blouses, tablecloths, lace, blankets, and carpets can be bought from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Folkart</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> or in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. Because they involve a high degree of hand-work, prices are often high.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Woodwork</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boxes</ENAMEX>, bowls, walking sticks, and the like carved by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peasants</ENAMEX> are fairly common. Look out for the fascinating ‚Äúsecret boxes,<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äù</ENAMEX> sometimes sold by gypsies. These appear to be unopenable, with no locks to undo or even hinges to pry open; but press a couple of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panels</ENAMEX> here, slide a couple of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX> there, and you‚Äôre in. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Don‚</ENAMEX>Äôt forget the seller‚Äôs instructions.
Sports
For a relatively small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hungary</ENAMEX> has enjoyed much <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Olympic and World Championship</ENAMEX> success. During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-1950s</TIMEX> its football <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> was one of the Ô¨Ånest in the world. For the most part, national sport was for the favoured few and pursued to promote the cause of communism. Despite this, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hungary</ENAMEX> still offers <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spectators</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> a busy world of sports. There may be no sea, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Lake Balaton</ENAMEX> does offer a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">playground</ENAMEX> for watersports‚Äô <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fans</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Horse</ENAMEX>-riders won‚Äôt be disappointed either; the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hungarians</ENAMEX> have been known for their equestrian prowess ever since the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Magyars</ENAMEX> swept over the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Great Plain</ENAMEX>.
Taking Part
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Billiards</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">bowling</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúBilliards</ENAMEX>,‚Äù which also includes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX>-pin bowling, snooker, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">pool</ENAMEX>, is a very popular pastime in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Budapest</ENAMEX>. For a list of venues ask <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tourinform</ENAMEX> or see the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sports</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leisure</ENAMEX> section in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Budapest Sun</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">Golf</ENAMEX>. This is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newcomer</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hungary</ENAMEX>, and you will have to drive some way out of town if you want to play. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Budapest Golf Course</ENAMEX> is a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>-hole, par <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> course with driving range, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">35 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">22 miles</NUMEX>) north at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kisoroszi</ENAMEX> (tel. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1170-6025</TIMEX>). Bookings are required. The nearest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">18-hole</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">course</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">200 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">120 miles</NUMEX>) away to the west in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B√ºkk.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Horseback</ENAMEX> riding. There are numerous good stables and horse-riding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> just outside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Budapest</ENAMEX>, and riding holidays around the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Balaton</ENAMEX> area and farther aÔ¨Åeld are on offer at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Budapesti Equestrian Club</ENAMEX> (tel. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">313-5210</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Petoreh√°zy Club Hotel</ENAMEX> (tel. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">176-5937</ENAMEX>). Ask <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tourinform</ENAMEX> for details, pay a visit to the aptly-named <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Pegazus Tours on Fereciek tere</ENAMEX>, or see the IBUSZ brochure, Riding in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hungary</ENAMEX>.
Ice skating. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> the lake in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">City Park</ENAMEX> is drained and turned into an ice <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rink</ENAMEX> with the romantic backdrop of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vajdahunyad Castle</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Squash</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">City Squash Club</ENAMEX> situated at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M√</ENAMEX>°rcib√°nyi t√<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">©r 13</NUMEX> (near <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Moszvka t√©r</NUMEX>) hires out racquets, balls, and even shoes (tel. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">325-0082</ENAMEX>).
<ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">Tennis</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hungary</ENAMEX> continues to produce some good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX>. There are a limited number of public <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX> for hire, although many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> have <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX> and there are numerous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clubs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Watersports</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WindsurÔ¨Ång</ENAMEX> and yachting are widely practised on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lake Balaton</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boards</ENAMEX> can be hired at the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX>. Motor <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">jet</ENAMEX>-skis are forbidden on the lake, but there is a mechanical water-ski pull at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Balatonf√ºred</ENAMEX> and you can jet-ski on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Danube</ENAMEX> near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Szentendre</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jets Sport</ENAMEX> (look for the signposts near the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hotel Party</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Highway 11</ENAMEX>).
Spectating
The major event of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> is the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Formula 1 Grand Prix</ENAMEX> meeting at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hungaroring</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 19 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">12 miles</NUMEX>) east of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">91</NUMEX>). Other important sports events are held at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">N√©pstadion</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> a short distance to the east of the centre.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Every week</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locals</ENAMEX> enjoy <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">football</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horse racing¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†the former is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hungary‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most popular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spectator</ENAMEX> sport. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> of the more popular of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Budapest‚Äôs</ENAMEX> first division football <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> are currently <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kispest-Honv√©d</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ferencv√°ros.</ENAMEX> Be aware that the latter has a thuggish minority among its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supporters</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">L√≥verseny</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">t√©r stadium</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Kerepesi √∫t 11</ENAMEX> is the main venue for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horse</ENAMEX> racing and attracts a large <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">Ô¨Çat race</ENAMEX> (galopp) <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX> is in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX>; meetings take place on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sundays</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thursdays</ENAMEX>. Trotting (harness-<ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">racing</ENAMEX>) meetings are held <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all year</TIMEX> round on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesdays</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturdays</TIMEX> at a smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stadium</ENAMEX> also on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Kerepesi √∫t</ENAMEX> (closer to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> centre).
Details of sporting events are printed in the foreign language listings <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazines</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">118</NUMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Style</ENAMEX> section of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Budapest Sun</ENAMEX> is particularly good.
Entertainment
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Budapest</ENAMEX> has a very active nightlife, as a glance through any of the newspaper listings sections will conÔ¨Årm. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> is best known for what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Westerners</ENAMEX> would regard as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">highbrow culture¬†‚Äî¬†theatre</ENAMEX>, opera, ballet, and particularly classical concerts. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Budapest</ENAMEX> tickets are much more democratically priced than in the West, and there is less of a class distinction amongst the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audiences</ENAMEX>.
Standard popular culture is also prevalent, ranging from a bland <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parisian</ENAMEX>-style cabaret to much raunchier ‚Äúgirly‚Äù shows. Big-name international music and showbiz acts also regularly call in at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Budapest¬†‚Äî¬†from Jean Michel Jarre</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chippendales</ENAMEX>. High-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rollers</ENAMEX> may like to note that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Budapest</ENAMEX> is eagerly embracing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">casinos</ENAMEX>.
Performing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arts</ENAMEX>
Theatrical life is very active: on average, several new productions give premi√®res in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hungary</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each week</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> has a number of Ô¨Åne theatres (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">sz√≠nh√°z</ENAMEX>), of which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vigad√≥</ENAMEX> is probably number one. However, except for the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">English-language Merlin Theatre</ENAMEX> (on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gerl√≥czy</ENAMEX> utca, tel. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">117-9338</ENAMEX>), all plays are staged in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Hungarian</ENAMEX>, thus excluding most of the foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX>. The language barrier is, of course, much less problematic with opera, ballet, and dance or music.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Opera House</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Andr√°ssy √∫t</ENAMEX> is the Ô¨Ånest of the city‚Äôs dedicated opera venues (the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vigad√≥</ENAMEX> also produces opera) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">connoisseurs</ENAMEX> rank it among <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Europe‚</ENAMEX>Äôs best.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ballet</ENAMEX> is performed at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Erkel Theatre</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">K√∂zt√°rsas√°g t√©r</ENAMEX> (which also stages opera), and at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nemzeti Sz√≠nh√°z</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Theatre</ENAMEX>) on <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Hevesi S√°ndor t√©r</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Budafest</ENAMEX> is a spectacular celebration of opera and ballet in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Opera House</ENAMEX>.
The main classical music venues are in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pest</ENAMEX>: the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Academy of Music</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Liszt Ferenc</ENAMEX> t√©r), and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Basilica</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">B√©la Bart√≥k Memorial House</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Csal√°n √∫t 29</ENAMEX>); venues in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Buda</ENAMEX> include the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Matthias Church</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Music History</ENAMEX>. During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX>, open-air performances are staged under the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stars</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Margaret Island</ENAMEX> or before authentic ancient backdrops in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle courtyards</ENAMEX>.
Tickets are available centrally: for the concert performances go to the ofÔ¨Åce at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">V√∂r√∂smarty</ENAMEX> t√©r, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>; for opera, go to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Andr√°ssy √∫t 18</ENAMEX>. Larger <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> will also make bookings for you, or you can simply go direct to the venue box ofÔ¨Åce. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tourinform</ENAMEX> also sells some concert tickets. The most comprehensive listings are given by the publication <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pesti Musor</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Koncert Kalend√°rium</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hungarian</ENAMEX> language only). A good free <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publication</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pesti Est</ENAMEX>, available at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">box offices</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>.
Musicals from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Broadway</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">London‚Äôs West End</ENAMEX> (like <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Cats</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Les Mis√©rables</ENAMEX>, etc.) can be enjoyed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Budapest</ENAMEX>, as long as you don‚Äôt mind a little <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hungarian</ENAMEX> in between the songs. Tickets are on sale at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Andr√°ssy √∫t booking ofÔ¨Åce</ENAMEX>.
For pop, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rock</ENAMEX>, and jazz concerts the best listing is the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publication</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Budapest Panorama</ENAMEX> (this also gives a good round-up of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bars</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pubs</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clubs</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>). Go to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Music Mix</ENAMEX> shop at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">V√</ENAMEX>°ci utca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX> for tickets.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clubs and Bars</ENAMEX>
Hungary‚Äôs late-night drinking and partying scene is not much different from that in other international <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚ÄúPubs‚Äù</ENAMEX> are based either on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> model or, more commonly, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> bierstube. There is also a variety of international <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Continental</ENAMEX>-style caf√©s, and authentic <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hungarian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX>, though the latter are not very apparent in the main tourist areas. Look for the sign s√∂r√∂zo if you are a beer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drinker</ENAMEX>, and boroz√≥ if you prefer <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX>. While a s√∂r√∂zo is often similar to a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> bierstube, however, a boroz√≥ is rarely like a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parisian</ENAMEX> wine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX> (and neither serves only <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beer</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX>). 
Live music is quite common, with jazz, suppressed as subversive in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Stalinist</ENAMEX> era, currently enjoying something of a renaissance in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Budapest</ENAMEX> nightspots. Most performances are blues and dixieland, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audiences</ENAMEX> are generally young. There are also several cabaret clubs presenting Ô¨Çoorshows with big-production numbers and scantily-clad <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dancers</ENAMEX>.
For <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> who prefer the excitement of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">casino</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hungary</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX> gambling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">establishments</ENAMEX>. The place to be seen is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hilton Hotel</ENAMEX>, which (in common with most <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Budapest</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">casinos</ENAMEX>) offers <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> roulette, blackjack, <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">poker</ENAMEX>, punto <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">banco</ENAMEX>, baccarat and, to clear you of loose change and give you a bit of exercise, slot machines. There are many other city <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">casinos</ENAMEX>: the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Vegas</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Atrium Hyatt</ENAMEX>; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gresham</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Gresham Building</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roosevelt</ENAMEX> t√©r; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sch√∂nbrun</ENAMEX> casino <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ship</ENAMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Chain Bridge</ENAMEX>; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Orfeum</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hotel B√©ke</ENAMEX>; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vigad√≥</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vigad√≥</ENAMEX> utca; and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">V√</ENAMEX>°rkert on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buda</ENAMEX> embankment at the southern tip of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Castle Hill</ENAMEX>. The latter is housed in a beautiful neo-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mikl√≥s Ybl</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designer</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Opera House</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Casinos</ENAMEX> generally open <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">from 4:00 p.m. to 3:00 or 4:00 a.m.</TIMEX>
Films
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hungarians</ENAMEX> take their movies seriously, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hungarian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX> have come up with lastingly interesting works. But the tourist is out of luck, because the domestic product is incomprehensible even locally and most of the foreign films are dubbed into <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Hungarian</ENAMEX>.
Folklore
Despite a recent cultural invasion from the West, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hungary</ENAMEX> still has a very active <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folk</ENAMEX>-music scene; and where there is music, dancing is never very far behind. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hungarian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folk</ENAMEX>-dancing is well worth watching, and takes you through the whole gamut of courtly wedding dances to high-energy, boot-slapping <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚ÄúLad‚Äôs Dances‚Äù</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 18th century</TIMEX>. As ever it‚Äôs best to catch it at local festivals, where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">performers</ENAMEX> are there for the love of dancing or local pride, as opposed to the tourist dollar. In the same vein, look out for the real <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gypsy dancers</ENAMEX> who have vivacity associated with the likes of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Andalucian</ENAMEX> Ô¨Çamenco <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">performers</ENAMEX>.
You can see <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hungarian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dancers¬†‚Äî¬†amateur</ENAMEX> or professional¬†‚Äî¬†most <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">nights</TIMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Municipal Folklore Centre</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Feh√©rv√°ri √∫t 47</ENAMEX>, south of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Gell√©rt Hill</ENAMEX>. Folklore evenings are also staged at other venues; the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hungarian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Folk Ensemble</ENAMEX> gives excellent performances. Folklore evenings of a different type are also touted by some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>. These are generally staged for tour <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> on whistle-stop visits, and while they provide an easy option, they are not representative of real <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hungarian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folk</ENAMEX> entertainment.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Children</ENAMEX>
The main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Budapest</ENAMEX>, and particularly <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pest</ENAMEX>, are busy with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and trafÔ¨Åc, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> have to be closely watched. Many other areas in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> and the surrounding region, however, are much more suitable for them. 
The obvious place to go is the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">City Park</ENAMEX>, where the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">zoo</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Vid√°m Park</ENAMEX> are within <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a few yards</NUMEX> of each other, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">circus</ENAMEX> makes regular appearances. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">zoo</ENAMEX> as well as the amusement <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> are more traditional than modern, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">circus</ENAMEX> is reputedly one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Europe‚</ENAMEX>Äôs best. If the weather is warm, the splendid <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Sz√©chenyi Baths</ENAMEX> is the perfect place for cooling off. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> there‚Äôs a boating lake in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">converts</ENAMEX> to an ice-skating <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rink</ENAMEX>.
The other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">oasis</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Margaret Island</ENAMEX>. You can spend a good <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hour</TIMEX> or so riding round it en famille on a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bicycle-carriage</ENAMEX> made for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>. You can also swim here in the city‚Äôs biggest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">baths</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palatinus Strand</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Children</ENAMEX> also seem to enjoy the open-air wave pool at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gell√©rt Hotel</ENAMEX>. Out of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lake Balaton</ENAMEX> is a good place for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">babies</ENAMEX>, particularly the southern edge where the sandy shore <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">slopes</ENAMEX> gently into warm <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cog-</ENAMEX>wheel railway and a small-gauge train takes you to the peaceful <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buda hills</ENAMEX>; the latter is staffed almost entirely by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, apart from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">driver</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41</NUMEX>). The chairlift is a great favourite. It‚Äôs a good idea to take along a picnic.
Older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> with an interest in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX> may enjoy a day at a riding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">82</NUMEX>) or one of the tour <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">operators‚Äô organized horse</ENAMEX> shows. Details are available from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBUSZ</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tourinform</ENAMEX>.
Nightlife possibilities include folkdancing (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">88</NUMEX>) or a not-so-traditional laser show at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Planetarium</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N√</ENAMEX>©pliget to the southeast of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city centre</ENAMEX>.
