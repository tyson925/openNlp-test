a brief History
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Birth of the Settlement</ENAMEX>
It is difficult to think of a less promising spot for what has become one of the worldâ€™s major <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>. Something must have been appealing about the marshy outlet of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">River Amstel</ENAMEX> where it meets the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">River IJ</ENAMEX> (pronounced <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œAyâ€)Â â€”Â a tidal inlet</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Zuider ZeeÂ â€”Â</ENAMEX> even although the area flooded on a regular basis with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> forced in by the prevailing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> winds.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Batavians</ENAMEX> travelled down the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rhine</ENAMEX> to found the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> permanent settlement here. Almost from the start the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> had to be controlled, and the tradition of damming and organized diversion of the river and the tides began. It has been a constant source of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> ever since.
The settlement was entered on maps of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Empire</ENAMEX>, but following <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Romeâ</ENAMEX>€™s decline, the land became the domain of various <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Germanic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tribes</ENAMEX> in what is known throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> as the â€œDark <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ages</TIMEX>.â€ This probably had little effect on the fledgling <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, whose main trade was fishing.
Towards <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the first millennium</TIMEX> the land we now call the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Netherlands</ENAMEX> was ruled by a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">feudal lordsÂ â€”Â assorted</ENAMEX> counts, dukes, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bishops</ENAMEX> who had total power over the land and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who lived on it.
From <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Fishing to Trading</ENAMEX>
The first wooden <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> were built in around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1200</TIMEX>, on artificial mounds called terps. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> was fortified against <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rival lords</ENAMEX>, and against the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">seawaterÂ â€”Â the River Amstel</ENAMEX> being dammed at what is now <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Dam Square</ENAMEX>. This was not just to control the tides but also to manipulate trade, as it prevented seagoing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX> from taking their goods down the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">riverÂ â€”Â they</ENAMEX> had to transfer the goods to locally owned <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> for their journey. It gave the local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populace</ENAMEX> a healthy income and began <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> important elements in the cityâ€™s history, the predominance of the merchant classes and the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">barges</ENAMEX> for inland trade.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1275</TIMEX> the settlement of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amstelredamme</ENAMEX>, as it was known, received permission from Count <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Floris of Holland</ENAMEX> to transport goods along the river <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Amstel</ENAMEX> without incurring tolls, giving the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> a monopoly on trade along the river. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1323</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Amstelredamme</ENAMEX> became a toll-free <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beer</ENAMEX>, and once a method of preserving <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">herring</ENAMEX> had been perfected in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 14th century</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> also had a product with a high profit margin and began exporting <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> around <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>.
However, something happened in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1345</TIMEX> which caused <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amstelredamme</ENAMEX> to change from being a mere trading <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port</ENAMEX> to a settlement of spiritual importance. A dying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> was given a piece of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">communion bread</ENAMEX> which he could not swallow. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attendants</ENAMEX> threw the piece in the fire it would not burn. The event was declared a miracle and within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few years</TIMEX> Amstelredamme became a place of pilgrimage, further increasing the wealth flowing into the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>.
The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 15th century</TIMEX> saw a healthy expansion of trade and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> rose dramatically. Catastrophic fires destroyed a large part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1421</TIMEX> and again in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1452</TIMEX>. Following the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> fire, legislation made it illegal to build with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wood</ENAMEX>, and brick became the material of choice. Today, only a few <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> remain from before the fires; the wooden <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Het Houten Huis</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Begijnhof</ENAMEX> is considered the oldest. The legislation brought about a veritable feast of civil engineering <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">projects</ENAMEX> including the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> of the city <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wall</ENAMEX>, incorporating the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Waag</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shreierstoren</ENAMEX>, in around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1480</TIMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Arrival of the Spanish</ENAMEX>
Meanwhile, politically, the climate was changing with a series of dynastic inter-marriages. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philip</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Burgundy</ENAMEX> began to bring some semblance of unification to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Low Countries</ENAMEX> (the region which roughly translates to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Netherlands</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Belgium</ENAMEX>) in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1420s</TIMEX>. He was succeeded by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles the Bold</ENAMEX>, whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maria</ENAMEX> married into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House of Hapsburg</ENAMEX>. Her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philip</ENAMEX> married <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isabella</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1500</TIMEX> she gave birth to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles</ENAMEX>, future <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles V</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ruler</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Netherlands</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holy Roman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Emperor</ENAMEX>, but more importantly, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">King of Spain</ENAMEX> and all her dominionsÂ â€”Â an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX> on which it was said the sun never set.
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> rule was ruthless but, for a while, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> was left alone. Its position as an important trading post kept it apart from the more barbarous behavior in other areas. It saw a threefold increase in its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">refugees</ENAMEX> flooded in from other parts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diamond</ENAMEX> polishers from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Antwerp</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX> brought their influences to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Religious Strife</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> was already developing a reputation of tolerance as these new and disparate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> settled into the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. At the same time, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin Lutherâ</ENAMEX>€™s new <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> doctrine, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Protestantism</ENAMEX>, was spreading like wildfire across <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. It took a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX> foothold in the northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">provinces</ENAMEX> of the Low CountriesÂ â€”Â with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> at its heart. It was at this time that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Huguenots</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Protestants</ENAMEX>) came to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> to flee persecution in their own <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>.
To counter <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Protestantism</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catholic Spanish</ENAMEX> instigated the vicious and cruel <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Inquisition</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1535</TIMEX> there were anti-papacy demonstrations in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Dam Square</ENAMEX> and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1550</TIMEX> an <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Edict of Blood</ENAMEX> was issued by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> to hunt out the heretics. Thus began <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">80 years</TIMEX> of civil strife in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> and the region of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Holland</ENAMEX>.
It is difficult to understand why <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles V</ENAMEX>, who was born in and had strong family ties to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Low Countries</ENAMEX>, should treat the region with such harshness, however the dynasty power base was in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> and emotion had no part in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Empire</ENAMEX>-making. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1567</TIMEX> he sent the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Duke</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alva</ENAMEX> to enforce heavy taxes and military rule on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX>.
Towards Independence
This atmosphere of intense fear and violence sowed the seeds of revolt. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House of Orange</ENAMEX> (with a power <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base</ENAMEX> around the small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>) had claim to lands in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Low Countries</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William the Silent</ENAMEX>, began to organize opposition to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> rule.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1578</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> rose up against the papal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> and threw them from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cityÂ â€”Â a</ENAMEX> time known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alteration</ENAMEX>. Unfortunately, though, all thoughts of tolerance were forgotten, and the zeal with which the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Inquisition</ENAMEX> sought out <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Protestants</ENAMEX> was turned on <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catholic</ENAMEX> worshippers. Their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX> were violated and they were forced to convert, or to worship in fearful secrecy.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1579</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">provinces</ENAMEX> north of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rhine</ENAMEX> conclude the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Treaty</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Utrecht</ENAMEX>, releasing the suffocating grip of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> rule. Although <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William</ENAMEX> was murdered in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1584</TIMEX>, his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sons</ENAMEX> continued his work, and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1648</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treaties</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">The Hague</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Westphalia</ENAMEX> saw the creation of the independent <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">State of the Netherlands</ENAMEX>, whose boundaries were very much as they are <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>.
The Coming of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golden Age</ENAMEX>
As <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> influence faded, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">star</ENAMEX> began to rise. First, they drew up agreements with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX>, who had themselves concluded trade treaties in the East making them the sole source of new goods such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spices</ENAMEX> and silks. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Merchants</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> bought these goods and sold them in the north, making vast profits in the process.
When the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> took <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1580</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">merchants</ENAMEX> decided to go into the import <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX> themselves, and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1595</TIMEX> sent their <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">fleet</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1602</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dutch East India Company</ENAMEX> (VOC) was founded and it obtained a monopoly on all trade <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">routes</ENAMEX> east of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cape</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Good Hope</ENAMEX>. It founded a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Batavia</ENAMEX> (now <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jakarta</ENAMEX>) in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Java</ENAMEX> and obtained a monopoly trade agreement with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1641</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VOC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX> under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">command</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abel Tasman</ENAMEX> landed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australia</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">some 150 years</TIMEX> before <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Captain Cook</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> also looked to the west, and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1609</TIMEX> sent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Englishman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Hudson</ENAMEX> to search for a route to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>. In fact, he landed far from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> and discovered the river which still bears his nameÂ â€”Â the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hudson</ENAMEX>; he also traded with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">native</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peoples</ENAMEX> for the purchase of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manhattan Island</ENAMEX> and travelled to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX>, taking several islands as <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX> brought back goods not seen before in the western world. Strange and wonderful <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">creatures</ENAMEX>, new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruits</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetables</ENAMEX>, and crafts of immense beauty, and they were all traded at immense profit with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nations</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Netherlands</ENAMEX> entered the period called the â€œGolden <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Age</ENAMEX>,â€ when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VOC</ENAMEX> was more powerful than many <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> was at the heart of this vast trading <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Empire</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rich</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">merchants</ENAMEX> needed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX> and a support infrastructure, which developed quickly in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> flooded in to take advantage of the new commercial opportunities, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> rose rapidly and the old medieval city simply could not cope. It was still very much within the boundaries set <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">almost 150 years before</TIMEX>. Plans were made for a series of new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canals</ENAMEX> forming in a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ring</ENAMEX> or girdle around the old <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">medieval horseshoeÂ â€”Â three</ENAMEX> in all, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Herengracht, Keizersgracht</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prinsengracht</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canal</ENAMEX> side <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lots</ENAMEX> were sold to the wealthy of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> who built the finest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> they could afford. The confidence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> brought opportunities for the arts and the burgeoning sciences. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rembrandt</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Frans Hals, Vermeer</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paulus Potter</ENAMEX> were all working in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this era</TIMEX>, their work much in demand by the merchant classes. At the same time the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guild of Surgeons</ENAMEX> was learning about the physiology of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> at their meeting place in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Waag</ENAMEX>, helped by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Antonie van Leeuwenhoek</ENAMEX> who had invented the microscope.
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Decline and Fall</ENAMEX>
Expansion quickly peaked however, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> powers who had carved up the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New World</ENAMEX> set about testing each other in dynastic conflicts and colonial rivalry. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> were the main <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">rivals</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> on the high seas, and there were several wars between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th and 18th centuries</TIMEX>. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1665â€“1667</NUMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> sailed up the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">River Medway</ENAMEX> and sank the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">fleet</ENAMEX> moored there.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">The 18th century</TIMEX> saw <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> grow into the foremost financial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">center</ENAMEX> in the world, but the seeds of decline had already been planted. When the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New England</ENAMEX> rose up in revolt against the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX>, they found ready <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">allies</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX>. From their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX> they sent caches of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX> and ammunition. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> were furious and went to war in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1780</TIMEX>, destroying the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">navy</ENAMEX> and signaling a sudden decline in power and influence from which the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Netherlands</ENAMEX> never recovered. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trade</ENAMEX> suffered to such an extent that in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1791</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VOC</ENAMEX> went into liquidation.
In the latter part of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the century</TIMEX> there were anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Orange</ENAMEX> demonstrations by pro-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">factions</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1795</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Napoleon Bonaparte</ENAMEX> took the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Netherlands</ENAMEX> in his epic march across <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. Under the yoke of another foreign power, and with trade at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an all time</TIMEX> low, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golden Age</ENAMEX> was truly dead.
The Return of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House of Orange</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Napoleon</ENAMEX> installed his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Holland</ENAMEX> and he chose to take the fine <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Town Hall</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Dam Square</ENAMEX> as his palaceÂ â€”Â now the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Koninklijk Palace</ENAMEX>. But <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">only four years later</TIMEX> he fled the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> after civil disturbances broke out when he raised taxes.
When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Napoleonâ</ENAMEX>€™s bubble burst and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> power began to wane, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William of Orange</ENAMEX> emerged from exile and was proclaimed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1813</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> had to work its way out of economic decline, but throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th century</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> grew steadily. Industrialization changed the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. With the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Central Station</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the century</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> turned its back on its seafaring past and looked towards the mechanical age for its future. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX> was built over the old harbor wall and some of the oldest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canals</ENAMEX> in the city <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> were filled in to allow better access to motorized <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicles</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Dam Square</ENAMEX> was landlocked for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time in its history. However, in the spirit of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Victorian Age</TIMEX>, the philanthropic city <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fathers</ENAMEX> funded the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> of several major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX>, along with instigating social reforms which created one of the first welfare <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">20th Century</ENAMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Netherlands</ENAMEX> stayed neutral in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WWI</ENAMEX> and efforts in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first half of the century</TIMEX> were concentrated on land reclamation which increased agricultural production and living space. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zuider Zee</ENAMEX> was finally tamed with the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> of a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">19-mile</NUMEX> dike, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Afsluitdijk</ENAMEX>, in the north. In the depression of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1930s</TIMEX> there were several schemes to cut unemployment, including the creation of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam BosÂ</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC"> â€”Â a park</ENAMEX> and woodland on the outskirts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> hoped to remain neutral at the outbreak of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WWII</ENAMEX>, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Germans</ENAMEX> had other ideas and occupied the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Low Countries</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1940</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dutch Royal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parliament</ENAMEX> escaped the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enemy</ENAMEX> to set up <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX>. Amsterdammers were horrified at the treatment of their <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> and the dock <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> staged a brave <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one-day</TIMEX> strike to protest, but almost all the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> were transported to concentration <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camps</ENAMEX>, never to return. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Prinsengracht</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Otto Frank</ENAMEX> and his family hid in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">attic</ENAMEX> of their business <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">premises</ENAMEX> for over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</TIMEX> before being discovered. His <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anne</ENAMEX> wrote a diary during their time in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">attic</ENAMEX>, which became an international bestseller after the war. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anne</ENAMEX> herself died at a concentration camp <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">only weeks</TIMEX> before the war ended.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 1944</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Operation Market Garden</ENAMEX>, made famous in the film <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A Bridge Too Far</ENAMEX>, saw <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of allied paratroops dropping into the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Netherlands</ENAMEX> to try and take key <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridges</ENAMEX> on rivers leading to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> welcomed them and rose up to help them but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX> failed and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Germans</ENAMEX> punished the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the winter</TIMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1944â€“1945</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Food</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fuel</ENAMEX> were withdrawn, leaving the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> to starve.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Modern State</ENAMEX>
Soon after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the war</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Far East</ENAMEX> gained their <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">independenceÂ â€”Â principally</ENAMEX> as the new country <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">IndonesiaÂ â€”Â as Holland</ENAMEX> sought to rebuild its shattered infrastructure. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> used this period to consolidate their social systems to the benefit of the whole <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> became a mecca for counter-culture <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> such as hippies, who were drawn by the well-known open-mindedness of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>.
â€œPeople powerâ€ began to exert its influence which ensured that, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> at least, progress did not mean sweeping away the past. Where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">developers</ENAMEX> saw the opportunity to demolish derelict <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canal houses</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">warehouses</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> fought (sometimes literally) to save what they considered their heritage. Today much of the historic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> is protected by statute although any redevelopment provokes much debate. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Muziek Theater</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1980s</TIMEX>, which resulted in the demolition of several old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>, was a case in pointÂ â€”Â with vitriolic demonstrations by local pressure <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> embraced the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Union</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU)Â â€”Â they</ENAMEX> joined in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1957</TIMEX> when it was still called the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> CommunityÂ â€”Â seeing it as a way of increasing their security and their economic stability. Their natural strengths in agricultural production and trade have ensured their success in the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">alliance</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Netherlands</ENAMEX> has become an important base for foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> who have trade ties in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. Throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1990s</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> have been at the forefront of a movement to open national borders, increase peopleâ€™s freedom of movement and expand trade within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX>, taking full part in the delicate negotiations which surrounded the launch of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Euro</ENAMEX> currency in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> has become one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">premier</ENAMEX> tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> in the world, trading on its historic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> and its wealth of artistic collections. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> it operates very much as it did during the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golden Age</ENAMEX> with banking, trade, and modern <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">â€pilgrimsâ€</ENAMEX> (in the form of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX>) to ensure that it remains a wealthy <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>.
Perhaps the only specter in the air is the one which worried the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhabitants</ENAMEX> of old Amstelredamme <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries before</TIMEX>; water levels. Global warming over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next few decades</TIMEX> threatens to raise water levels around the world, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NetherlandsÂ â€”Â â€œnetherâ€ means â€œlow-lyingâ€</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">â€œbelowâ€Â â€”Â will</ENAMEX> have to work hard at solving the problem for its future <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhabitants</ENAMEX>.
