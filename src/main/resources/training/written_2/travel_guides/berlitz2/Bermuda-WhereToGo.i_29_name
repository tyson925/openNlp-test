Where to Go
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bermuda</ENAMEX> is a small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of islands and thus relatively easy to explore. Distances are short here, so the unavailability of rental <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> (they‚Äôre off-limits to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX>!) is really a plus. It means you‚Äôll be on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">buses</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">taxis</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bicycles</ENAMEX>, or mopeds¬<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">†‚Äî¬†or on foot¬†‚Äî¬†to enjoy Bermuda‚</ENAMEX>Äôs many pleasures. And the pace is relaxed; speed limits are only <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">32 km</NUMEX>/h (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20 mph</NUMEX>). 
Around every corner there are beautiful views, elegant architecture, and exquisite natural areas. Combine this with a wealth of historical attractions, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX>, forts, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bermuda</ENAMEX> is an explorer‚Äôs delight. We start our tour at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hamilton</ENAMEX>, the capital, then travel from this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">center</ENAMEX> first to the south and west, and then to the east and north.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hamilton</ENAMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bermuda</ENAMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1815</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hamilton</ENAMEX> is a very small and friendly <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, despite its importance in the world of finance, banking, and insurance. It is the heart of government and decision making, and because it is the only container <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX> on the island, it is also the center of shipping and trade. Local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> gravitate here for shopping and entertainment, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> crowd the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> when the cruise <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX> are in town.
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Front Street</ENAMEX> runs along the water and is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> part of town seen by cruise <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX> come to shore. It is the life and soul of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hamilton</ENAMEX> and a focus for many activities, especially during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer months</TIMEX>. A long row of pastel-painted <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> offer the best in tax-free shopping: jewelry, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liquor</ENAMEX>, clothing, and crystal. Explore the narrow alleyways that lead off <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Front Street</ENAMEX> to discover small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> selling collectibles or locally designed arts and crafts, or small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> offering local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">seafood</ENAMEX>. On <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Front Street</ENAMEX> itself there are a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> with verandas on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> floor, where you can have a drink or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meal</ENAMEX> and watch the world go by. At the west end of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Front Street</ENAMEX>, on the waterfront, you will find the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Visitor Service Bureau</ENAMEX> and the terminal for the local ferries that ply across <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Great</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Little Sound</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hamilton</ENAMEX> to the southern and western parts of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bermuda</ENAMEX>.
On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> evenings, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Front Street</ENAMEX> comes alive with <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Harbour Night</ENAMEX>. Street <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">performers</ENAMEX>, craft <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stalls</ENAMEX>, and late-night shopping are all part of the festivities. There is also the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Beat Retreat Ceremony</ENAMEX>, where the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Band and Corps of Drums of the Bermuda Regiment and the Bermuda Islands Pipe Band</ENAMEX>, in full military dress, march the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> to recreate a centuries-old ceremony.
Most of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hamilton‚</ENAMEX>Äôs attractions can be seen on foot and would make an enjoyable day‚Äôs stroll. But there is also the option of taking a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">carriage</ENAMEX> ride through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">streets¬†‚Äî¬†there‚</ENAMEX>Äôs nothing more romantic than a horse-drawn carriage taking a stately route. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carriages</ENAMEX> can be hired on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Front Street</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX> season. 
On foot, your tour might begin at the head <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bank</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bermuda</ENAMEX>, which is on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Front Street</ENAMEX> behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ferry Terminal</ENAMEX>. This is one of the few ‚Äúhigh-rise‚Äù <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hamilton</ENAMEX>, as most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">town‚Äôs structures</ENAMEX> are less than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> stories in height. The formal fa√ßade has a number of heraldic plaques signifying its ancient pedigree. Inside, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX> keeps a collection of rare and valuable coins dating back through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bermuda‚</ENAMEX>Äôs history. Every type of coin minted by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crown</ENAMEX> can be found here, from the time of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">James I</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1603</TIMEX> (when the charter was granted that brought <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bermuda‚Äôs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">first settlers</ENAMEX>) to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the present day</TIMEX>, including an example of ‚ÄúHog‚Äù money. Be sure to see the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1887 ¬£5</ENAMEX> coin, which caused consternation among <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> of the time. Because the crown pictured on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Queen Victoria‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> was far too small, many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> thought that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Queen</ENAMEX> (and, by extension, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX>) looked ridiculous. 
From the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> for Queen Street, which leads north from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Birdcage</ENAMEX>, a metal cage once used by police <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> to direct the traffic that regularly comes to a halt on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Front Street</ENAMEX>. It was designed by a Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bird</ENAMEX>, although it also has a resemblance to <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚ÄúTweetie Bird‚Äôs‚</ENAMEX>Äù <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cage</ENAMEX>. Traffic lights now regulate the junction. Remember to look right as you prepare to cross the road! 
On the left as you walk up Queen Street is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Perot Post Office</ENAMEX>, named after the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who was appointed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bermuda‚Äôs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">first Postmaster General</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1821</TIMEX>. He had actually been acting as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">‚Äúunofficial‚Äù postman</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several years</TIMEX>, meeting the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX> and putting the letters under his hat before touring the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> to deliver them. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William B. Perot</ENAMEX> (pronounced ‚<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">ÄúPea-rut‚Äù</NUMEX>) went <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> stage further in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1848</TIMEX> when he began to produce his own postage stamps; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 11</NUMEX> are known to exist <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, making each one extremely valuable. The little <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post Office</ENAMEX> is very much as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Perot</ENAMEX> kept it, neat and simply furnished. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> still houses an active <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">post office</ENAMEX>, which makes it an appropriate place to buy the stamps for your postcards. Bermudian stamps always have a colorful and interesting design; perhaps you can start a collection by buying a set for yourself.
Just behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post Office</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bermuda National Library</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Historical Society Museum</ENAMEX>, prime collections devoted to important historical documents and artifacts from the island. The public <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> are small but full of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bermudian</ENAMEX> treasures. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Silver</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">china</ENAMEX>, coins, and furniture have been gathered together, including rare and valuable ‚Äúhog‚Äù money as well as some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Confederate</ENAMEX> notes that were used to pay for goods before <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the Civil War</ENAMEX>. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Bermudian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">businessmen</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sailors</ENAMEX> were paid in money that became worthless after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unionists</ENAMEX> won the war.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> is set in gardens, now called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Par</ENAMEX>-la-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ville Park</ENAMEX>, that are open to the public <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX>. Here you will find <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">businessmen</ENAMEX> eating lunch, chattering school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, and a family of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> who call the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">place home</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Perot</ENAMEX> planned the gardens during his time at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post Office</ENAMEX>, and the spot has changed very little since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that time</TIMEX>.
Queen Street climbs as far as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Church Street</ENAMEX>, a main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">east-west thoroughfare</ENAMEX> named for the many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> of worship located along its course. When you reach <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Church Street</ENAMEX>, take a right turn. A little way up the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> on the left is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hamilton City Hall</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arts Centre</ENAMEX>, a bright white <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> with a distinctive painted clock on the front facade. It now contains the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bermuda National Gallery</ENAMEX>, built around the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Watlington</ENAMEX> collection of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17th- and 18th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> paintings by such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joshua Reynolds</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Gainsborough</ENAMEX>. Also here is The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bermuda Society of Arts</ENAMEX>, a venue for local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> to display their work, and host to visiting exhibitions.
Next to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">City Hall</ENAMEX> is the island‚Äôs main bus <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terminal</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">hub</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bermuda‚</ENAMEX>Äôs public transportation system which is on-time, clean, and efficient. You will see here the boarding locations for the island‚Äôs various bus routes (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">126</NUMEX>). 
Across <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Victoria Street</ENAMEX> from the bus <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terminal</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Victoria Park</ENAMEX>, originally a children‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">playground</ENAMEX> but later landscaped to commemorate the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Silver Jubilee of Queen Victoria</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1887</TIMEX>. The main features are the sunken garden, <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">lawns</ENAMEX>, and flowerbeds in traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> style, and the beautiful ornate iron <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bandstand</ENAMEX>, where open-air concerts are still performed during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX> and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December</TIMEX> just before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX>.
Return to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Church Street</ENAMEX> and walk east to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cathedral of the Most Holy Trinity</ENAMEX>, consecrated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1905</TIMEX> after a fire destroyed the previous edifice in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1884</TIMEX>. The style is <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Early English</ENAMEX>, with a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> rising <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">44 m</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">143 ft</ENAMEX>) to provide good views of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>. You can climb to the top for a small donation to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> funds; the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> is open on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekdays only</TIMEX>. Perhaps the most dramatic area in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> is the wall behind the altar, where there are sculptures in niches depicting <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christ</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">saints</ENAMEX>. Completed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1967</TIMEX> it is a fitting modern edition to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>. By contrast, farther along <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Church Street</ENAMEX> is the oldest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hamilton</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Andrew‚Äôs Presbyterian Church</ENAMEX> (founded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1843</TIMEX>), as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wesley Methodist Church</ENAMEX>.
Across <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Church Street</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wesley Methodist Church</ENAMEX> you will find the rear portion of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sessions House</ENAMEX>, home to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bermuda Assembly</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX>. Walk down <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Parliament Street</ENAMEX> to reach the front of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sessions House</ENAMEX> dates from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1819</TIMEX>, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italianate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX>, colonnades, and decorative touches were added in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1887</TIMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Silver Jubilee</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bermuda‚Äôs parliament</ENAMEX> is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> oldest in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Commonwealth</ENAMEX> and is still modeled after its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">predecessor</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX>. The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> opening ceremonies and the regular sessions are open to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>, who can sit in the public gallery to watch the robed and white-wigged <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Speaker</ENAMEX> preside over the legislative deliberations (the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Assembly</ENAMEX> meets on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Fridays</TIMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late October</TIMEX> until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early July</TIMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> can also be viewed and is in session throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">home</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bermuda Senate</ENAMEX> is farther down <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Parliament Street</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cabinet House</ENAMEX> (built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1833</TIMEX>), where the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">premier</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cabinet</ENAMEX> also have <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> has welcomed a number of world <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> to its meeting <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX>, including Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Winston Churchill</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John F. Kennedy</ENAMEX>. The ceremonial sword of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, mace, and oar are kept here and used at the opening of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">parliament</ENAMEX>, held <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each year</TIMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early November</TIMEX>. The opening speech is given from a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bermuda Cedar</ENAMEX> seat fashioned in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1642</TIMEX>, when meetings were still held in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. George‚Äôs</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bermuda‚Äôs Senate</ENAMEX> has no legislative powers and is rather more of a debating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">forum</ENAMEX>; its sessions can be observed on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesdays</TIMEX>.
Outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cabinet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Front Street</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cenotaph</ENAMEX>, which commemorates <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bermuda‚</ENAMEX>Äôs dead of the two <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">World Wars</ENAMEX>. The monument dates from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1920</TIMEX>, its design based on that of the war memorial that stands in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">London‚Äôs Whitehall</ENAMEX>. The solemn ceremonies of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Remembrance Day</TIMEX> take place here on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11 November each year</TIMEX>, when wreaths are laid and silent homage is paid to those who gave their lives.
From <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Front Street</ENAMEX>, a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">ten-minute</TIMEX> walk up the steep incline of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">King Street</ENAMEX> leads to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fort Hamilton</ENAMEX>, which was built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1889</TIMEX> to protect the harbor and formed part of a line of defense for the naval <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">dockyard</ENAMEX> to the west. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> it offers spectacular views over the rooftops of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hamilton</ENAMEX>, especially thrilling when the cruise <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX> are in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX>. The upper levels and battlements have been landscaped with fine <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">lawns</ENAMEX>, which make a fine place for a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> picnic. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Long</ENAMEX>, cool <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tunnels</ENAMEX> in the depths of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">defenses</ENAMEX> were originally dug as a protected route for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ammunition replenishment</ENAMEX>. They also lead to the deep <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">moat</ENAMEX>, once the first line of protection against manned assault but now converted into a splendid tropical garden with varieties of giant bamboo, fern, and ficus. <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">Creeping plants</ENAMEX> now climb the sheer walls, providing a new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> to numerous <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX>, lizards, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">frogs</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Every Monday</TIMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November to March</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fort hosts</ENAMEX> a display by the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bermuda Islands Pipe Band</ENAMEX>, complete with kilts and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">highland dancers</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Front Street</ENAMEX>, out of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hamilton</ENAMEX> yet <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">only a few minutes</TIMEX> walk from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town center</ENAMEX>, is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bermuda Underwater Exploration Institute</ENAMEX>, which celebrates the important part <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bermuda</ENAMEX> has played in the development of this fledgling science and sport. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> has a light and spacious modern design, offering the chance to wander easily among the exhibits. A short video tells the story of the development of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bathysphere</ENAMEX>, a machine that could withstand the immense water pressure <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">thousands of feet</NUMEX> beneath the surface so that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> could study the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">creatures</ENAMEX> living at those depths. Displays explain how a seashell is created, and, in the next <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Stonington Collection</ENAMEX> comprises <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5000</NUMEX> different seashell varieties from around the world, including many found in waters off <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bermuda</ENAMEX>. The sheer variety and beauty are breathtaking.
The finale of your visit to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institute</ENAMEX> is a simulated trip aboard a deep-sea exploration <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessel</ENAMEX> that transports you <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3,660 m</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 12,000 ft</NUMEX>) under sea, the approximate depth of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX> in the waters surrounding <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bermuda‚</ENAMEX>Äôs shallow coral reefs. The introduction to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">‚Äúdive‚Äù paints</ENAMEX> a vivid picture of the geology of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bermuda</ENAMEX> and its incredible position in the middle of this vast, deep ocean. Your journey leads through re-creations of the environments found at several different ocean layers, then on to displays of treasure salvaged from wrecks around the island. The whole exhibit makes you appreciate the work of the ferry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> who guide <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX> in and out of the treacherous reefs surrounding <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bermuda</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spanish Point</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hamilton</ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pembroke Parish</ENAMEX>, lies a small area of land reaching out into the mouth of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Great Sound</ENAMEX>. Vehicles reach this area through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Black Watch Pass</ENAMEX>, a cutting through the high coral cliff that was opened in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1934</TIMEX>. Over <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2.5 million tons</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rock</ENAMEX> were removed to create the first route over the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Shore Cliffs</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> (bus route <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#4</NUMEX>) ends at <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Point</ENAMEX> and the small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Stovel Bay</ENAMEX>, where there is a picturesque <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> with views of the distant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dockyard</ENAMEX> across the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">strait</ENAMEX>. An intriguing wreck lies at <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Point</ENAMEX>, part of the floating <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dock</ENAMEX> (the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> largest in the world) that once sat at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Naval Dockyard</ENAMEX>. It was being towed out of the harbor for scrap but broke loose from its ties and foundered on rocks here, never to be moved again.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hamilton</ENAMEX>
The journey out of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hamilton</ENAMEX> to the south leads through the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">parishes</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paget, Warwick</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southampton</ENAMEX> before reaching <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandys Parish</ENAMEX>, where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúhook‚Äù</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bermuda</ENAMEX> curves up to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Somerset</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ireland</ENAMEX> islands. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">south coast</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">miles</NUMEX> of sublime pink-sand beaches and a reef wall that parallels the coastline. After the spectacular panorama viewed from <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Gibb‚Äôs Hill Lighthouse</ENAMEX> (on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bermuda‚</ENAMEX>Äôs highest points), the land narrows to a string of small islands held together by a series of small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridges</ENAMEX> leading eventually to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Britain‚</ENAMEX>Äôs former glory.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leave Hamilton</ENAMEX> by traveling east on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Front Street¬†‚Äî¬†with</ENAMEX> the harbor on your <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">right¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†until you reach a traffic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">circle</ENAMEX> (roundabout). Take the ‚ÄúFoot of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lane</ENAMEX>,‚Äù then turn onto <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pomander Road</ENAMEX> to reach <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Waterville</ENAMEX>, a historic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> and now <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bermuda National Trust</ENAMEX>. The home belonged to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trimingham</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, prominent business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> who still operate the best-known department store <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> on the island. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Harvey Trimingham</ENAMEX> began trading from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Waterville</ENAMEX> site in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1842</TIMEX> and opened the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Front Street Store</ENAMEX> (still in business) in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1861</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>, one of the oldest on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bermuda</ENAMEX>, was built around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1725</TIMEX> on land bought by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Trimingham</ENAMEX> II. Originally, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> built <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX> and operated a wharf in front of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>, ‚Äúat the foot of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lane</ENAMEX>,‚Äù as the end of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hamilton Harbour</ENAMEX> was then known. The bottom floor of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> was used to store goods and equipment, while the upper floor provided living <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">quarters</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1961</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> was acquired by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Historic Monuments Trust</ENAMEX>, precursor to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bermuda National Trust</ENAMEX>, but it was still occupied by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elderly</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trimingham</ENAMEX> family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> on the upper level are open to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Trimingham</ENAMEX> furniture and family portraits can be seen. Just as popular are the gardens, set against the water‚Äôs edge. A <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">300-year-old</TIMEX> tamarind <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> sheds comforting shade over the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>, and ducks come from the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> to share your <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sandwiches</ENAMEX>. 
If you turn up <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Berry Hill Road</ENAMEX> at the same roundabout, you will find the entrance to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Botanical Gardens</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Camden</ENAMEX> (bus route <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#1</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Camden</ENAMEX> was designated as the official <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bermuda‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">premier</ENAMEX> after self-government began in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1970</TIMEX>. It is an impressive colonial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> with painted shutters and fretwork. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Botanical Gardens</ENAMEX> that surround the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> were inaugurated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1898</TIMEX> and doubled in size to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">15 hectares</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">36 acres</NUMEX>) in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1921</TIMEX>. There are large glass <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> with cacti and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">orchids</ENAMEX> along with formal gardens, <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">lawns</ENAMEX>, and an aromatic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garden</ENAMEX> designed for the enjoyment of blind <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>. There are also tables under the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> in the rolling landscape in front of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Camden</ENAMEX> for picnics. The whole area is a delight for <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plant</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lovers</ENAMEX> and anyone else who wants a pleasant spot to relax.
Leaving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hamilton</ENAMEX>
You can take <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> main routes to travel south and west along <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Bermuda‚Äôs ‚Äúfish-</ENAMEX>hook.‚Äù The northernmost (called most appropriately <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harbour Road</ENAMEX>) leads along the south shore of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hamilton Harbour</ENAMEX>, with views of the islands that lie scattered in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Great Sound</ENAMEX> and make navigation into the cruise <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX> so tricky. A number of ferry <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terminals</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hamilton</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Warwick</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hamilton</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Paget</ENAMEX> routes can be found on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harbour Road</ENAMEX>, as can many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> and guest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>, away from the bustle of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hamilton</ENAMEX> but within easy reach of all its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX>.
The middle route (up <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Crow Lane</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stone Hill</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Middle Road</ENAMEX>) is the most direct if you are in a hurry. It leads past the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Belmont Country Club</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hotel</ENAMEX>, with its fine <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">golf course</ENAMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">later</TIMEX> passes the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Waterlot Inn</ENAMEX>, one of the finest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> on the island. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> is from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th century</TIMEX> and occupies a setting at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of a pretty bay (bus route <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#8</NUMEX>).
The most southerly <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South Road</ENAMEX>) is the most scenic and leads to some of the best beaches and finest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bermuda</ENAMEX> (bus route <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#7</NUMEX>). 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South Road</ENAMEX>
You will come first to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Elbow Beach Resort</ENAMEX> and the nearby public <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bermuda Beach</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> is one of the premier <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> and sits on a long stretch of sand that is for hotel <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guests</ENAMEX> exclusively. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South Road</ENAMEX> travels on top of the cliffs and offers beautiful views of the sand dunes and beaches below. Don‚Äôt worry about trying to take in these views while driving, for there are many stopping places along the way where you can take photographs or simply enjoy the panorama. The way to each beach is marked with a wooden sign, which leads to parking areas for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bicycles</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> off the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>. 
Once you reach <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Warwick Long Bay</ENAMEX> there are a series of public beaches that allow you to walk along the sand or find a patch to call your own for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miles</ENAMEX> of footpaths in the dunes and undulating grassland behind the beaches have been designated as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Shore Park</ENAMEX>. These areas are perfect for walking, jogging, or horseback riding (see box opposite).
The most southerly of the beaches fronting <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">South Shore Park</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Horseshoe Bay</ENAMEX>, one of the prettiest and most photographed on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bermuda</ENAMEX>. A crescent of fine pink-tinged <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sand</ENAMEX> with good <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> including a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">caf√©</ENAMEX>, it makes a good starting or finishing point for your explorations. 
The next bay to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Horseshoe Bay</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Whale Bay</ENAMEX>, the private beach of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southampton Princess Hotel</ENAMEX>, which sits majestically on the hills above. From the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX> is easily seen with its pale pink color. Below are the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">greens</ENAMEX> and fairways of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Princess‚</ENAMEX>Äôs executive <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">golf course</ENAMEX>, always busy with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> enjoying a round. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX> also plays host to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dolphin Quest</ENAMEX>, an encounter with one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">man‚Äôs favorite animals</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Adults</ENAMEX> can enjoy a hands-on encounter and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> are offered special interactive programs under the supervision of a qualified <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trainer</ENAMEX>. The program runs <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all year</TIMEX> round in a small lagoon area close to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37</NUMEX>).
Turn right beyond the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Henry VIII</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX> to reach <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Gibb‚Äôs Hill Lighthouse</ENAMEX>, which still plays an important role in protecting <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX> passing through the waters close to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bermuda</ENAMEX>. Built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1844</TIMEX>, it is one of the world‚Äôs few remaining lighthouses to be constructed of iron. The light, which is now fully automated, can be seen by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">64 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">40 miles</NUMEX>) away. Take the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">185</NUMEX> steps to the top for panoramic views of the island. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Britain‚Äôs Queen Elizabeth II</ENAMEX> made an official visit to the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">lighthouse</ENAMEX>, she stopped at the roadside below to admire the view toward <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Riddell‚Äôs Bay</ENAMEX> and the islands of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Great Sound</ENAMEX>. A small bronze plaque now marks the site, designated <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Queen‚Äôs View</ENAMEX>, where you can look at the landscape only slightly altered through the passage of time. 
To the West End
One mile beyond the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">lighthouse, South Road joins Middle Road</ENAMEX>, which continues on toward <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bermuda‚Äôs West End</ENAMEX> (bus routes <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#7 and #8</NUMEX>). Vestiges of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Railway Trail</ENAMEX> intertwine with the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> in this area. Half <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a mile</NUMEX> from the junction, look out for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Industrial Park Road</ENAMEX> on the left, where you will find <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bermuda Triangle Brewing</ENAMEX>. It produces such memorable concoctions as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilde Hogge</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hammerhead</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">brewery</ENAMEX> offers guided tours that demonstrate the brewing process from fermentation to bottling, with free samples of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">freshly</ENAMEX> brewed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beer</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer months</TIMEX> there are tours <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4pm</TIMEX>; in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> the tours are on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">only</TIMEX>. 
Farther along <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Middle Road</ENAMEX> a small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lane</ENAMEX> leads to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Whale Bay</ENAMEX>, a small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> that got its name from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">whales</ENAMEX> that were slaughtered here in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> gone by. <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Port Royal Golf Course</ENAMEX>, one of the oldest on the island, fills much of this area before the road leads on to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Somerset Island</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">West End</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Somerset</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ireland Islands</ENAMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX> that connects <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Somerset Island</ENAMEX> and its parish of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sandys</ENAMEX> (pronounced <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚ÄúSands‚Äù</ENAMEX>) to the main <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> is quite short. If you travelled on immediately it would be easy to miss <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the curiosities of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bermuda</ENAMEX>, for <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Somerset Bridge</ENAMEX> is said to be the narrowest drawbridge in the world. The section which opens is wide enough to allow the passage of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">only a boat‚</NUMEX>Äôs mast! It is operated by simply lifting <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> planks of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wood</ENAMEX> by hand; one has to marvel at the skill of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sailors</ENAMEX> who use the bridge regularly. The bridge and surrounding supports were renovated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>. The ferry service from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hamilton</ENAMEX> also stops here on its way to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dockyard</ENAMEX>. Take the ferry or walk along the old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Bermuda Railway Trail</ENAMEX>, which is extremely scenic along this section. There are several deep ‚<ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">Äúcuts‚Äù</ENAMEX> created for the rail line, with tiny wooden foot <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridges</ENAMEX> over the top.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Somerset Island</ENAMEX> leads around a pretty bay and onto <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fort Scaur</ENAMEX>, which stands on a rocky hillock hidden from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">fort</ENAMEX> was begun in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1869</TIMEX> to protect the land route to the naval <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dockyard</ENAMEX> at the end of the island. The layout is the so-called <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Prussian</ENAMEX> design, a polygon shape developed by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineers</ENAMEX> at the time. The gunning placements held ‚<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">Äúdisappearing‚Äù guns</ENAMEX>, which could not be seen from land or sea. Other gunning placements were also added by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineers</ENAMEX> during <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War</ENAMEX> II. A sturdy caponier (a small fortified <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> with openings for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">rifles</ENAMEX>) was to act as a last defense if the battlements were overrun. It was never needed, as the fort never saw any action, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> the ramparts offer panoramic views of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Great Sound</ENAMEX>. There are <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">9 hectares</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">22 acres</NUMEX>) of grassland all around the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">fort</ENAMEX> where you can enjoy a picnic.
Just beyond the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">fort</ENAMEX>, watch out for a narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lane</ENAMEX> to the right with a sign for the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Heydon Trust Chapel</ENAMEX>. This simple place of worship, on land set aside for personal reflection, is open at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">all hours</TIMEX> for those who want to come and pray. (The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> is listed on maps of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1616</TIMEX> as a personal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX>.) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Visitors</ENAMEX> can admire the architecture and see the old <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> storage <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tank</ENAMEX> that collects <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> for use inside.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Somerset</ENAMEX> lies <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only half</NUMEX> a mile beyond the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">fort</ENAMEX>. It is a small settlement but has many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> that are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branches</ENAMEX> of larger <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hamilton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> and also a couple of well-regarded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> for a leisurely lunch. 
Off its far northern tip, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Somerset Island</ENAMEX> is attached by <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX> to a string of smaller islands: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Watford Island</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boaz Island</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ireland Island</ENAMEX>. It is on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ireland Island South</ENAMEX> where you will find the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Naval Cemetery</ENAMEX> set beside the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>. All navy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> were buried here, along with many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilian workers</ENAMEX> needed to run the base. A stroll along the footpath allows you to read some of the sad ends that they suffered. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sunstroke</ENAMEX> and yellow <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">fever</ENAMEX> appear as common causes of death. So, too, does drowning from accidents in the frequent winter squalls that caught <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sailors</ENAMEX> unaware. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sailors</ENAMEX> could not swim, so being lost overboard was a fate they all dreaded. 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Naval</ENAMEX> Dockyard
It was the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Duke</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wellington</ENAMEX> who, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1809</TIMEX>, vowed to make <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bermuda</ENAMEX> the ‚ÄúGibraltar of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">West‚Äù</ENAMEX> and created a plan for a massive naval <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base</ENAMEX> on the island. The whole project demanded far more labor than existed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX>, so Crown <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prisoners</ENAMEX> were shipped here to complete the task. They were billeted in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX> brought over from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>, which were then tied up at dockside. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúhulks‚Äù</ENAMEX> (as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> were known) were overcrowded and unsanitary. Many died from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malnutrition</ENAMEX> before the work was complete, but the dockyard proved to be a bastion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">British Empire</ENAMEX> and served to protect the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">motherland</ENAMEX> even as recently as <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War</ENAMEX> II.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Postwar</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> military presence dwindled, and the main sections of the dockyard were closed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1951</TIMEX>. They were deserted for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a number of years</TIMEX> before being brought to life as a tourist attraction. Today, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Naval Dockyard</ENAMEX>, on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ireland Island North</ENAMEX>, has been reborn with a number of sights and activities. You could certainly spend <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a morning</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an afternoon</TIMEX> exploring here.
Start your tour at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bermuda Maritime Museum</ENAMEX>, opened in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1975</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Queen Elizabeth</ENAMEX> II. If traveling by bus (Routes <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#7</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#8</NUMEX>), you will alight at the last stop; arriving by ferry, you should turn right from the ferry <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX> and follow the footpath around the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dock</ENAMEX>, where you will see the walls of the central fortress (or <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚Äúkeep‚Äù</ENAMEX>) rising in front of you. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> is entered through a large archway beyond a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">moat</ENAMEX>. It covers <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">21‚ÅÑ2 hectares</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6 acres</NUMEX>), and various collections are housed in the old brick military <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>, most of which date from the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Victorian era</TIMEX>. Where ordnance was once stored there are now collections of coins and treasure salvaged from the ocean floor. You will also find displays of diving equipment used over the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX> to explore the shipwrecks that can be found all around the treacherous reefs off the coast here.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Boat Loft</ENAMEX> houses a collection reflecting Bermuda‚Äôs innovative local designs, including a fully rigged, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gleamingly polished ‚Äúfitted dinghy</ENAMEX>,‚Äù famed for the size of its enormous sail. Such <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> were developed to allow quick access to incoming <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early days</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> were in competition with each other to reach incoming cargoes <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> and thus secure the business. The exhibit also details the role <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bermuda</ENAMEX> has played in the world of competitive sailing. On an island where shipbuilding was an important industry, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> had the skills to design and produce fast <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX>. Racing started as an informal pastime, but in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1840</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samuel Triscott</ENAMEX> (a local victualer) organized the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> regatta. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bermuda Royal Yacht Club</ENAMEX> was organized in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1844</TIMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gentlemen yachtsmen</ENAMEX>, not long after the founding of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bermuda Native Yacht Club</ENAMEX> (BNYC) for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">native boatmen</ENAMEX> (many of whom were working <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> and crewmen). 
After looking around these collections, climb the hill to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commissioner‚Äôs House</ENAMEX>, where you will find fine views of the surrounding coastline and the rest of the dockyard <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>, with wonderful large <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX>, befits its role as home to what was once the most powerful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> on the island. The whole structure is supported by an iron <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">foundation</ENAMEX>, said to be hurricane-proof. 
In the old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cooperage</ENAMEX> across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum</ENAMEX> are the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Craft Centre and the Arts Centre</ENAMEX>, both great places to search for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bermudian</ENAMEX> souvenir. The most renowned working <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> have studio spaces here, with displays of local work using such raw materials as wood, sea shells, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>.
Walk through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cooperage</ENAMEX> to reach the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Victualing Yard</ENAMEX>, where you will find the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tourist Information Bureau</ENAMEX>, then across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> and around the dry dock area, which is still used to repair the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> and buoys so vital to ship safety. On the left is the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bermuda Pottery</ENAMEX>, where you‚Äôll find <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> crafting and firing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ceramics</ENAMEX> with a series of island motifs. 
Your walk will then lead to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Clocktower Building</ENAMEX>, perhaps the most elegant of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> at dockyard. Its long lines and minimalist fa√ßade once housed administrative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>, but the interior has been transformed into a smart shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mall</ENAMEX> with luxury goods from jewelry to cigars. Above the ground floor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> is a light, open space designed for conventions and exhibitions.
There are several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> in the dockyard as well as places to sit in the sunshine and have a picnic. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX>, cruise <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX> dock at the small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX> outside the main harbor wall, providing a good picture of how the working <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dockyard</ENAMEX> must have looked when it was home to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> naval <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hamilton</ENAMEX>
To travel north from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hamilton</ENAMEX> means traversing the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">parishes</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pembroke</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Devonshire, Smith‚Äôs</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hamilton</ENAMEX> (the latter not to be confused with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of the same name!), then on to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. George‚Äôs Parish</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bermuda‚</ENAMEX>Äôs northernmost tip. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North Shore Road</ENAMEX> provides views of the rocky coastline. On the verdant <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">South Shore</ENAMEX> there are fine period <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>, many still in private hands. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> of the world‚Äôs finest golf <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses nestle</ENAMEX> against <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Harrington Sound</ENAMEX>, a large caldera now filled with tidal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seawater</ENAMEX>. Finally, you reach the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">birthplace</ENAMEX> of this <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> protectorate: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. George‚Äôs</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> that still reflects <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">its 17th-century</TIMEX> beginnings.
Taking <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Cavendish Road</ENAMEX> out of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hamilton</ENAMEX> leads to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Middle Road</ENAMEX>, which runs through the widest section of land in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bermuda</ENAMEX>. Although they are never more than <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a mile</NUMEX> from the sea, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who live here are considered country <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dwellers</ENAMEX> by those who live on the coast. 
You will come first to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Arboretum</ENAMEX> (bus route <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#3</NUMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">9 hectares</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">22 acres</NUMEX>) of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">lawns</ENAMEX> and woods filled with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">native</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>. Separate swathes of land concentrate on collections of ficus and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">palms</ENAMEX>, with an area of general woodland beyond. It‚Äôs a great place for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> to run wild or explore in the undergrowth.
Less than <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a mile</NUMEX> past the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Arboretum</ENAMEX>, you will find <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX> on the right side of the road, backed by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of white painted family tombs on the hillside. The larger <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> first catches the eye, but it is the smaller whitewashed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Old Devonshire Church</ENAMEX> that holds the interest. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> originally erected here in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1716</TIMEX> was totally destroyed by a mysterious explosion on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Easter Sunday</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31 March 1970</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> on the site <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> is an exact replica of the original and was built with money collected by public donation. The very simple interior provides the perfect environment for quiet reflection and prayer.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Middle Road</ENAMEX> eventually reaches the village of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Flatts</ENAMEX> at the edge of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Harrington Sound</ENAMEX>. The sound, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">some 3‚ÄÇkm</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 miles</NUMEX>) in diameter, is thought to be a huge caldera that formed after a powerful volcanic eruption. Some areas of this inland sea are immensely deep, attracting marine <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">creatures</ENAMEX> to the safe <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boats</ENAMEX> also take advantage of the protective shield, and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">April‚ÄìOctober</ENAMEX>) diving and snorkeling are popular pastimes. A narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX> fords the gap between the sound and the open sea through <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Flatts Inlet</ENAMEX>. The tidal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX> are constantly flowing in and out through the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">9-m</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">30-ft</NUMEX>) opening. A number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> rest on the waters of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Flatts Inlet</ENAMEX>, which is one of the most photogenic spots on the island. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX> have a translucent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">turquoise hue</ENAMEX> that appears almost artificial, and the swaying palms create a truly tropical scene.
On the far side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX> that spans the entrance to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Harrington Sound</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bermuda Aquarium</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Natural History Museum</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zoo</ENAMEX> (bus routes <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#3</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#10</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#11</NUMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> were established in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1926</TIMEX> to educate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">native Bermudians</ENAMEX> about life under the seas that surround them. Over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> species of sea <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">creatures</ENAMEX> live in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">tanks</ENAMEX>, including <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">one 145,000-gallon</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tank</ENAMEX> whose <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> is regularly replaced by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seawater</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Harrington Sound</ENAMEX>. Healthy coral reefs here support a small ecosystem. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Natural History Museum</ENAMEX> has a number of dioramas depicting the geological formation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bermudian</ENAMEX> islands and reefs, starting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">some 100 million years ago</TIMEX>. It explains how the many <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cave systems</ENAMEX> were formed and how the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of unique <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flora</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">fauna</ENAMEX> developed on this isolated piece of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rock</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">zoo</ENAMEX> is small but extremely varied for such a small island. Important conservation work is being undertaken. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> is working on a program to increase the numbers of flamingos in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US Virgin Islands</ENAMEX>, and you will find a small flock here successfully breeding <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each year</TIMEX>. Juveniles have been sent around the world to increase the breeding stock. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golden Lion Tamarins</ENAMEX> (a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">South American</ENAMEX> marmoset) have also been successfully bred here. There is an interesting <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australasian</ENAMEX> area, with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bennett</ENAMEX> wallabies and a bintubong (also called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚Äúbearcat‚Äù</ENAMEX>), a large marsupial with a prehensile tail that sits on a tree <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">stump</ENAMEX> watching the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> pass by.
From the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aquarium</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North Shore Road</ENAMEX> (bus routes <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#10 and #11</NUMEX>) continues to the east. On the left you will find the tiny <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Railway Museum</ENAMEX>, housed in one of the old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station houses</ENAMEX>. Its exhibits fascinating photographs of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">railway</ENAMEX>, dubbed ‚Äúthe old rattle and shake‚Äù by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locals</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ladies</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> hats are pictured, waiting at small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platforms</ENAMEX> as the engine approaches, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trains</ENAMEX> making their way down a crowded <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Front Street</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hamilton</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">14 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">22 miles</NUMEX>) of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">track</ENAMEX> had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stations</ENAMEX> along its route, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">service</ENAMEX> ran for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">only 16 years¬†‚</NUMEX>Äî¬†from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1931 until 1947¬†‚Äî¬</TIMEX>†before it accumulated such heavy losses that all the rolling stock and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tracks</ENAMEX> were sold to what was then <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Guiana</ENAMEX>. The path of the railway <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">line</ENAMEX> can clearly be seen in many parts of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bermuda</ENAMEX> and is now a valuable natural resource, enjoyed safely by walkers, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">runners</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cyclists</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horse</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">riders</ENAMEX>.
Only a couple of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> farther along the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North Shore Road</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shelly Bay</ENAMEX>, a picturesque sheltered beach that shelves very gently. It is backed by a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> and play area, making it an ideal place to bring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>. A caf√© operates in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shelly Bay</ENAMEX> is one of the few beaches on this part of the island, which is better known for the rugged rocks running along the north shore.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bailey‚Äôs Bay</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bailey‚Äôs Bay</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">northern</ENAMEX> section of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hamilton Parish</ENAMEX>, which you‚Äôll find just before reaching the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Causeway</ENAMEX> that crosses <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Castle Harbour</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. George‚Äôs.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bailey‚Äôs Bay</ENAMEX> has a number of attractions within walking distance of each other. If traveling by bus, get off at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Swizzle Inn</ENAMEX>, famed across the island for its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚ÄúRum Swizzle‚</ENAMEX>Äù <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drinks</ENAMEX> (made from a secret recipe); it‚Äôs also a great place for lunch. 
Only a short walk west from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inn</ENAMEX>, you will find the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bermuda Perfumery and Gardens</ENAMEX>. This small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> business was established in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1929</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madeleine</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herbert Scott</ENAMEX> in a garden shed. They moved to their present site in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1939</TIMEX> and proceeded to plant the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">acres</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> that serve as raw materials to produce their small range of signature fragrances. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX> has now been passed on to their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX>. You can take a free tour of the ‚Äúfactory,‚Äù housed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a 200-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">farmhouse</ENAMEX>, where you can watch the process of perfume production, including the techniques for collecting the ripe blooms. Then take your time and wander among the fragrant gardens with their swathes of jasmine, frangipani, and passion flower,their scents heavy in the warm air. You can also browse in the gift <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop</ENAMEX>, which sells <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">perfumes</ENAMEX> produced here as well as other souvenirs. 
After leaving the perfumery, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> back toward the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Swizzle Inn</ENAMEX> and turn right at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Wilkinson Avenue</ENAMEX> (by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bailey‚Äôs Ice Cream Parlour</ENAMEX>). From here it is only a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five-minute</TIMEX> walk to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crystal Caves</ENAMEX>. The unique geological conditions that formed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bermuda</ENAMEX> created a number of cave systems. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Experts</ENAMEX> claim that there are many yet to be explored and charted, and perhaps the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crystal Cave</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> might itself have been left undiscovered were it not for a quirk of fate. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1907</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> were playing <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">cricket</ENAMEX>, and after a particularly good stroke they lost the ball down a small sinkhole. They decided to try to retrieve the ball and, with ropes and lanterns, they entered the hole and discovered a magical landscape <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">37 m</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">120 ft</ENAMEX>) underground. They never did find their cricket ball, but when you enter the caves you will understand why they became distracted from their original purpose. The caves have cathedral-like dimensions, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of stalactites and stalagmites <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds of thousands</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years old</TIMEX>. The stalactites grow at a rate of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1 cm</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about a half inch</NUMEX>) <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every 100 years</TIMEX>, so it is easy to begin to estimate the age of the largest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX>. A clear tidal lake sits at the bottom of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">cave</ENAMEX>, spanned by a pontoon <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX> so you can explore the interior. Strategic lighting shows the formations to their best <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">effect¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†and nature at its most awe-inspiring. 
Just a short distance beyond the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Swizzle Inn</ENAMEX>, near the entrance to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grotto Bay Hotel</ENAMEX>, is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bermuda Glass Blowing Studio</ENAMEX>. From <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX> you‚Äôll see how heat from the furnace and the skill of the glass <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">blower</ENAMEX> combine to create beautiful and colorful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX>. You can also buy one of these unusual souvenirs in the attached <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">gallery</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Coast</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Castle</ENAMEX> Harbour
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South Road</ENAMEX> (bus route <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#1</NUMEX>) leads east from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hamilton</ENAMEX> area, through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paget</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Devonshire</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">parishes</ENAMEX> to the southern edge of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Harrington Sound</ENAMEX> and then on toward <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Castle Harbour</ENAMEX>. There are many large private <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> here in the southeast part of the island, standing proudly behind tropical <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">gardens</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">About a mile</NUMEX> beyond the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Botanical Gardens</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42</NUMEX>), there is a narrow turnoff from the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> leading to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Devonshire Bay</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fishermen</ENAMEX> land their catches in the bay and sell them from small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stalls</ENAMEX> set on the flat rocks surrounding the beach. 
Continue your journey to the east on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South Road</ENAMEX> and make a left turn at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Collector‚Äôs Hill</ENAMEX>, which is just before a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>. Travel up the road to reach <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Verdmont Museum</ENAMEX>, a historic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> on top of the hill. (There is no sign for the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> from the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>.) Built on <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20 hectares</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 acres</NUMEX>) of land, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Verdmont</ENAMEX> is believed to date from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about 1710</TIMEX>. Unusually, it is much more classically <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Georgian</ENAMEX> than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bermudian</ENAMEX> in style. It was constructed for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Smith</ENAMEX>, a prominent ship <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">owner</ENAMEX>, and several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX> of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> lived here. It has a fine <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">twelve-windowed</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fa√ßade¬†‚Äî¬†all</ENAMEX> still original¬†‚Äî¬†and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> stories, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> on each of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floors</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> has remained practically unchanged and was a private home until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1951</TIMEX>; its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> never added the modern conveniences of electricity and plumbing. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> it is brimming with fine period furnishings, although only the portraits are original to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>. The wooden paneling, floors, and staircase add an elegant air to the structure. Now owned by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bermuda National Trust</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Verdmont</ENAMEX> is surrounded by a walled <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garden</ENAMEX> filled with herbs and fruit orchards along with a swathe of replanted forest of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">cedar</ENAMEX> and palmetto <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">palms</ENAMEX>.
Farther along, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South Road</ENAMEX> moves closer to the coast, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spittal Pond Nature Reserve</ENAMEX> soon appears to the right. Its <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">14 hectares</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">34 acres</NUMEX>) comprise <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bermuda‚</ENAMEX>Äôs largest wildlife <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">sanctuary</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> for migratory and native <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bird species</ENAMEX> alike. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> ponds provide a marshy wetland, complemented by a coastal cliff environment beloved by terns and visiting longtails. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Owls</ENAMEX> and the obligatory kiskadee inhabit the woodlands. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spittal Pond</ENAMEX> is well known for providing rest and recuperation for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> blown off course on long migratory routes: it is possible to spot unusual species that have drifted off their normal routes. Well-worn walking <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">trails</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> are easy to follow, but be aware that there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> car <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">sanctuary</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">east</ENAMEX> and west). Don‚Äôt forget which one you parked in!
The main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> leads east along the coast to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Smith‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bay</ENAMEX>, a small but much-photographed beach for swimming and snorkeling. Just beyond the bay, there is a left turn leading to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Devil‚Äôs Hole Aquarium</ENAMEX>, at the very southern tip of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Harrington Sound</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the oldest tourist attractions in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bermuda</ENAMEX>, it has been welcoming <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1834</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hole</ENAMEX> is in fact a collapsed <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cave</ENAMEX>, producing a natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seawater</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">aquarium</ENAMEX> that has become home to a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">voracious fish</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sharks</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">turtles</ENAMEX> waiting at the surface to be fed. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> (usually large tarpon) seem to enjoy the regular food service offered by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>. Incidentally, the name <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚ÄúDevil‚Äôs Hole‚Äù</ENAMEX> derives from the sound of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seawater</ENAMEX> entering and leaving the hole, rather than from the fearsome reputation of some of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhabitants</ENAMEX>.
From <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Devil‚Äôs Hole Aquarium</ENAMEX> it is possible to take the road left to the village of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Flatts</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North Shore Road</ENAMEX>. However, you can go back to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South Road</ENAMEX> in the direction of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Tucker‚Äôs Town</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> important golf <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tucker‚Äôs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Town</ENAMEX> is not a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> but rather a collection of exclusive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> and large high-class <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX> set in rolling hills and small sheltered coastal bays. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Mid Ocean Golf Course and Castle Harbour Golf Course</ENAMEX> straddle the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX> here, their verdant <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">greens</ENAMEX> and fairways tumbling across the undulating land, separated by small casuarina copses. (Be mindful of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of play as you pass across the fairways here: there is a danger from flying or wayward balls!) The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mid Ocean Club</ENAMEX> is still a private members‚Äô <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">club</ENAMEX> with a long pedigree. It has played host to many important political summits since the end of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX>, including the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">‚ÄúBig Three‚Äù Conference</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1953</TIMEX> attended by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Winston Churchill</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dwight D. Eisenhower</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Laniel</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prime minister</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South Road</ENAMEX> comes to an abrupt end at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Tucker‚Äôs Town Bay</ENAMEX>, a small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">jetty</ENAMEX> and inlet with yachts <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bobbing</ENAMEX> gently in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>. To get across <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Castle Harbour</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. George‚Äôs</ENAMEX>, you must go north here, taking <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Paynter‚Äôs Road to Harrington Sound</ENAMEX>. Then drive up along <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Harrington Sound Road</ENAMEX> to reach the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Causeway</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. George‚Äôs.</ENAMEX> 
On your way up <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Harrington Sound Road</ENAMEX>, you will come to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lemington Caves</ENAMEX>, a series of caves smaller than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crystal Caves</ENAMEX> but equally spectacular. Watch also for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walsingham Lane</ENAMEX> and a sign to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Moore‚Äôs Tavern</ENAMEX>, named after the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Irish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poet</ENAMEX> who spent some time on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bermuda</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tavern</ENAMEX> (which is in fact a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> and local cuisine) is open only in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the evening</TIMEX>. In the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">daytime</TIMEX> you can visit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Idwal Hughes Nature Reserve</ENAMEX>, also along <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Walsingham Lane¬†‚Äî¬†a pristine</ENAMEX> area of natural habitat. Collapsed limestone caves and tidal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seawater mangrove</ENAMEX> swamps provide a perfect home for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">herons</ENAMEX>, tropical <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">frogs</ENAMEX>, and many species of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">East End</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. George‚Äôs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. David‚Äôs Islands</ENAMEX>
To reach the remaining portions of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bermuda</ENAMEX>, including the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. George‚Äôs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, you must take the narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Causeway</ENAMEX> across <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Castle Harbour</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">concrete Causeway</ENAMEX> was built as a temporary substitute for the bridge lost after a hurricane in the early part of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 20th century</TIMEX>, but it has never been replaced. If you travel by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">motorcycle</ENAMEX> on a windy day, be sure to take extra care as the gusts can be quite strong. There is a small swing-<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX> at the far end that can be slippery when wet; however, the middle lanes have been created specially for the passage of mopeds and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bicycles</ENAMEX>.
Once over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Causeway</ENAMEX>, you are on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">St. David‚Äôs Island</ENAMEX>. You‚Äôll see the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX> terminal <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">immediately ahead</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> travels between the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">runway</ENAMEX> on the right and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">turquoise waters</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ferry Reach</ENAMEX> on the left. A large white <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> houses the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bermuda Biological Station for Research</ENAMEX>, established in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1903</TIMEX> to perform marine studies in conjunction with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard University</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bermuda Natural History Society</ENAMEX>. A traffic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">circle</ENAMEX> (roundabout) past the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX> leads left to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. George‚Äôs</ENAMEX> and right to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. David‚Äôs.</ENAMEX> 
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. David‚Äôs Island</ENAMEX>
Now larger in area than <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. George‚Äôs Island</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. David‚Äôs Island</ENAMEX> was one of the most isolated of the populated islands that make up <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bermuda</ENAMEX> until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1940</TIMEX>, when the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> leased the area to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> military. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> was needed as a military <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base</ENAMEX> but was too small for that purpose, so extra land was reclaimed from the sea to create a land area big enough for an air <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base</ENAMEX> and naval <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX>. Much of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. David‚Äôs</ENAMEX> subsequently became a small piece of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> soil. Activity has slowly been wound down in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> service <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> are not as numerous as during the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">post-World War II</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>.
To reach <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. David‚Äôs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, travel along <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">St. David‚Äôs Road</ENAMEX> from the traffic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">circle</ENAMEX> on the far side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX>. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bus</ENAMEX> route <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#6</NUMEX> travels to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. David‚</ENAMEX>Äôs from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. George‚Äôs</ENAMEX>.) The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">native population</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. David‚Äôs</ENAMEX> has always been noted for its fishing skills. The original town grew up around the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> military batteries built to protect the southern entrance to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. George‚Äôs Harbour</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> is still in the protection business, but <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> it looks out for the shipping that passes through the waters around <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bermuda</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. David‚Äôs Lighthouse</ENAMEX> stands on the highest point on the eastern tip of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> and sends its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">beam</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">32 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20 miles</NUMEX>) over the ocean. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> took <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three years</TIMEX> to build, and the light was activated on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 November 1879</TIMEX>. It also acts as the finishing line for such major <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">yacht</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">races</ENAMEX> as the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Newport</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bermuda</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Groups</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">humpbacked whales</ENAMEX> that pass through <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bermuda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX> can clearly be seen from this vantage point.
Off the coast to the south of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. David‚Äôs Island</ENAMEX> is smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nonsuch Island</ENAMEX>, once a quarantine <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX> for sufferers of yellow fever. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1961</TIMEX>, a small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bermuda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">petrels</ENAMEX> was discovered to be nesting on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nonsuch</ENAMEX>, and it has remained a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">sanctuary</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that time</TIMEX>. Visits are limited but can be made by arrangement with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Agriculture</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Parks</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tel</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">236-4201</ENAMEX>).
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. George‚Äôs Island</ENAMEX>
Back at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX>, cross the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX> and turn left to get to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ferry Point</ENAMEX>, an important strategic area of land at the western tip of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. George‚Äôs Island</ENAMEX>. There are no less than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> separate fortifications here protecting the entrance to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. George‚Äôs Harbour</ENAMEX>. The earliest was <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Burnt Point Fort</ENAMEX>, built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1688</TIMEX> to help stop illegal trading by local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sailors</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Ferry Island Fort</ENAMEX>, on a small island a short distance offshore, was begun in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1790s</TIMEX> and was almost constantly developed for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next 80 years</TIMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1823</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Major</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Blanchard</ENAMEX> constructed <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Martello Tower</ENAMEX> on high ground behind the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> forts, where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX> could survey the surrounding land and coastline. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> the remains of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">fortifications</ENAMEX> comprise <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ferry Point Park</ENAMEX>, where it is possible to explore the forts at your leisure, walk through woodland, and enjoy the beauties of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lover‚Äôs Lake</ENAMEX>. It is a wonderful place to have a picnic, and it‚Äôs relatively quiet, even on a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer weekend</TIMEX>. 
Returning to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ferry Point</ENAMEX> junction, take the north fork to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. George‚Äôs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>. You‚Äôll travel around the far side of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mullet Bay¬†‚Äî¬†a</ENAMEX> sheltered natural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">harbor</ENAMEX> for small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">craft¬†‚Äî¬†and</ENAMEX> then past a children‚Äôs play area before reaching the outskirts of town. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. George‚</ENAMEX>Äôs can be reached via bus routes <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#1</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#3</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#10</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#11</NUMEX>.)
Set in the far northeast portion of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bermuda</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. George‚</ENAMEX>Äôs is the island‚Äôs oldest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> and the historic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">heartland</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX>. Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Somers</ENAMEX> and his brave band of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">settlers</ENAMEX> were heading for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1609</TIMEX> when they were shipwrecked on reefs just offshore from here. They were surprised by the natural riches that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bermuda</ENAMEX> had to offer, as the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> had good <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">cedar</ENAMEX> wood to build more <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX>. Out of adversity came good fortune, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">settlers</ENAMEX> soon built <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX> and sailed from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bermuda</ENAMEX> to complete their original goal of reaching <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jamestown</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Somers</ENAMEX> returned to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bermuda</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the following year</TIMEX> but died here before he could develop the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> further.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">settlers</ENAMEX> who founded the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1615</TIMEX> created a basic grid pattern that has remained unchanged. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> are wide enough for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horse</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">carriage</ENAMEX>, but no wider. They retain their original names, some with reference to local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> and activities such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Printer‚Äôs Alley</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Aunt Peggy‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lane</ENAMEX>. Main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> such as Queen Street and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Duke</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">York Street</ENAMEX> recall the monarchs and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> important to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Crown</ENAMEX>. Take time to wander along the narrow lanes¬†‚Äî¬†beyond the noise of contemporary <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Bermuda¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†where you can imagine yourself back in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16th and 17th centuries</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> is small, so it is difficult to lose your way. As you walk, you will find many historic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX> providing many more clues to the lives of these fascinating <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>.
Start at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">King‚Äôs Square</ENAMEX> on the waterfront. Originally known as <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">‚ÄúMarket Square</ENAMEX>,‚Äù it was the center of all activity for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>. Here you will find the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tourist Information</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>, whose helpful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> will be able to supply you with information about the day‚Äôs activities. On the east side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Town Hall</ENAMEX>, which dates from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1782</TIMEX>. Although relatively young by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. George‚</ENAMEX>Äôs standards, it has wonderful cedar wood floors and ceilings. Here you can find out about the previous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lord mayors</ENAMEX> and view a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">commemorative ‚ÄúCharles</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diana‚</ENAMEX>Äù signature, harkening back to happy times.
At the northwest corner of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bermuda Museum of the National Trust</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">This 17th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> was constructed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Governor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samuel Day</ENAMEX>, who arrived from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX>, found the old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">governor‚Äôs house</ENAMEX> in disrepair, and built this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX> using government land and government wood¬<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">†‚Äî¬†yet</ENAMEX> he refused to hand over the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> when he was ousted from office after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">only two years</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX> became a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Globe</ENAMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-19th century</TIMEX> but attracted notoriety again in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1860s</TIMEX> when it became the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Confederate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> during the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Civil War</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1952</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> was acquired by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bermuda Historical Monuments Trust</ENAMEX> and was opened as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1961</TIMEX>, with substantial refurbishment in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>. 
On the ground floor, pride of place is given to a detailed model of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Somers‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ship</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sea Venture</ENAMEX>. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> are also fascinated by a replica of a machine commissioned by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Confederate States</ENAMEX> that stamped a seal for all their official documents. There is also a short video presentation called <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚ÄúBermuda</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Centre</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX>,‚Äù which tells the story of the founding and development of the island. Climb the stairs to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> floor, where the so-called <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Rogues</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Runners Museum</ENAMEX> presents a detailed exposition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bermuda‚</ENAMEX>Äôs role in the American <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Civil War</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bermuda</ENAMEX> had many ties with the southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> through both business and family bloodlines. Although <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> officially remained neutral, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bermudians</ENAMEX> favored the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South</ENAMEX>, wanting to help their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">friends¬†‚Äî¬†and</ENAMEX> make a lot of money in the process. A series of short information <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boards</ENAMEX> brings to life different aspects of this intriguing time in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bermuda‚Äôs</ENAMEX> history. Sadly, it also documents the true story of the blockade-runner <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fannie</ENAMEX>, which returned from one trip in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 1864</TIMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sick crew members</ENAMEX>. The yellow fever they carried soon spread across <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bermuda</ENAMEX>, killing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">many hundreds</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Graves</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Naval Cemetery</ENAMEX> (near the dockyard at the other end of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bermuda</ENAMEX>) offer testimony to some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> who succumbed to this dreadful disease. 
In <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">King‚Äôs Square</ENAMEX>, you can witness re-enactments of many of its historic functions. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town crier</ENAMEX> will call the news of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX>, and wrongdoers will be punished in the stocks that sit outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bank of Butterfield</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>. Nearby on the water‚Äôs edge is a dunking stool, used in times past for nagging <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wives</ENAMEX> or busybodies. Today, local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ladies</ENAMEX> dressed in costume brave the waters to the delight of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>.
A small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX> leads to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ordnance Island</ENAMEX>, a tiny <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only 9 m</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> ft) offshore, used <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> as a cruise dock in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer months</TIMEX>. Named for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX> once kept there, it was used also to hang condemned <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prisoners</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> it has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> important monuments dating back to the birth of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bermuda</ENAMEX>. On the left is a full-size replica of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ship</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Deliverance</ENAMEX>, one of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX> that Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Somers</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">settlers</ENAMEX> rebuilt following the shipwreck of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sea Venture</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1609</TIMEX>. The tiny interior is not for the claustrophobic and gives a good idea of how difficult the journey must have been, as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> huddled together in a minuscule, poorly ventilated <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">space</ENAMEX> with only rudimentary sanitation. To the right of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ordnance Island</ENAMEX> is a sculpture of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Somers</ENAMEX> by a leading <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Bermudian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Desmond Fountain</ENAMEX>. It depicts a wind- and sea-swept Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George</ENAMEX> in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dramatic¬†‚Äî¬†perhaps anguished¬†‚Äî¬†pose</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX> outstretched. 
In the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> around <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">King‚Äôs Square</ENAMEX> are a delightful number of attractions that tell the story of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. George‚</ENAMEX>Äôs from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 17th-century</TIMEX> settlement to the changes that have taken place in modern times. To the left of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Town Hall</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">walkway</ENAMEX> leading to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">King Street</ENAMEX> (a cobbled <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> important historical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bridge House</ENAMEX>, an L-shaped <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> on the left side. This is the oldest inhabited <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> on the island (dating from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about 1700</TIMEX>) and is still in remarkably good condition considering the volatile weather that it has undoubtedly had to contend with. It is named <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bridge House</ENAMEX> because it sat opposite a small wooden <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX> that once led to the harbor here. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>, now owned by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Trust</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bermuda</ENAMEX>, is split into <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartments</ENAMEX> that can be visited on certain <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days each year</TIMEX> (details are available from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Trust</ENAMEX>). However, part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> also houses the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Bridge House Gallery</ENAMEX>, a commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">gallery</ENAMEX> selling <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Bermudian</ENAMEX> art. The original design of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> can clearly be seen in the interior of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">gallery</ENAMEX>. Many of the earliest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Governors</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bermuda</ENAMEX> lived here, including <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alured Popple</ENAMEX>, famed for his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">statesmanly</ENAMEX> handling of the island‚Äôs affairs and the reinforcing of her <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">defenses</ENAMEX>.
At the top of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">King Street</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State House</ENAMEX>, built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1620s</TIMEX> to house <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bermuda‚Äôs Assembly.</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> it is the oldest stone <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> on the island. The plain fa√ßade and sturdy walls were designed to withstand hurricanes and the worst of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX> humidity. It was used continuously until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1815</TIMEX>, when the island‚Äôs capital was moved from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. George‚</ENAMEX>Äôs to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hamilton</ENAMEX>. The local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Masonic</ENAMEX> lodge negotiated with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Assembly</ENAMEX> to use the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>, with a rent of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">one peppercorn</NUMEX> per year, a price that remains in force to this day. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúpeppercorn‚Äù</ENAMEX> rent is handed over to the crown in one of the most ornate ceremonial occasions of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX>, with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mayor</ENAMEX> and town <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> in full official regalia.
Water Street leads away from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">King‚Äôs Square</ENAMEX> to the west. It has many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> selling tax-free goods; the modern <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> occupy space in much older <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>. Wander along the traffic-free <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">thoroughfare</ENAMEX> to do some leisurely souvenir hunting. On your right, watch for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tucker House Museum</ENAMEX>, which was from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1775</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">home</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Tucker</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Governor‚Äôs Council</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tuckers</ENAMEX> were one of the most influential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bermuda</ENAMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> having arrived on the island in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1616</TIMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1950</TIMEX>, a descendant¬†‚Äî¬†an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Tucker¬</ENAMEX>†‚Äî¬†bequeathed many family heirlooms to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> in his will. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen</ENAMEX> area, originally separated from the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>, was once a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">barbershop</ENAMEX> operated by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Raine</ENAMEX>, a black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who came to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bermuda</ENAMEX> to escape the worst of the American <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Civil War</ENAMEX>. Once the war was over, he and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> returned to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX>, where he became the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> elected to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House of Representatives</ENAMEX>.
Across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carriage Museum</ENAMEX>. Until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1940s</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX> and carriages were the only modes of transportation permitted along the narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bermuda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX>, and almost every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">well-to-do family</ENAMEX> had a horse-drawn <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicle</ENAMEX>. However, these disappeared almost immediately following a relaxation of the strict rules that had kept motor <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicles</ENAMEX> off the island. This collection of beautiful carriages celebrates those ‚Äúgone-but-not-forgotten‚Äù <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Peter‚Äôs Church</ENAMEX> sits on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Duke</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">York Street</ENAMEX>, now the main route through the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>. Originally built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1612</TIMEX>, it is the oldest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Western Hemisphere</ENAMEX> still regularly used for services; much of the present structure dates from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1713</TIMEX>. The beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> is filled with <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">Bermudian cedar</ENAMEX> for the roof supports and the pews. The font is even older than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> itself and was brought with the earliest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">settlers</ENAMEX> from a previous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX>. Pride of place goes to the collection of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">silver</ENAMEX>, the chalice, the chalice set, and the alms basin, all dating from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th century</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> has also kept old coins dating from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1616</TIMEX>. Behind the south churchyard you can find the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Old Rectory</ENAMEX>, built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 18th century</TIMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pirate George Drew</ENAMEX> and kept in beautiful order by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bermuda National Trust</ENAMEX>.
Take <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Duke</ENAMEX> of Kent Street north from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town center</ENAMEX> to reach a number of important attractions. Almost immediately on the left is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. George‚Äôs Historical Society Museum</ENAMEX>, set in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">an 18th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> that was once home to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitchell</ENAMEX> family. Walk up the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äúwelcome arms‚Äù staircase</ENAMEX> (a common feature of family <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">era</TIMEX>) and step into a treasure-trove of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bermudiana</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Furniture</ENAMEX>, clothing, and works of art have all been donated or bought to add to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fascinating¬†‚Äî¬†and constantly growing¬†‚Äî¬†collection</ENAMEX>. Here is everything from buttons to bottles to old bathtubs. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen</ENAMEX> at the back of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> is filled with authentic pieces: earthenware jars for storage, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">copper</ENAMEX> cups for measuring, iron pots for cooking. The admission price includes <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bermudian banana bread</ENAMEX>. 
Around the corner in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Featherbed Alley</ENAMEX>, you will find <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Featherbed Alley Printery</ENAMEX>, a small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> with a working model of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Gutenberg</ENAMEX> printing press first brought from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Stockdale</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1783</TIMEX> and used to produce the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bermuda Gazette¬†‚Äî¬†first</ENAMEX> issued on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17 January 1784</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> where the paper was originally printed is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stockdale House</ENAMEX>, on the corner of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Printer‚Äôs Alley</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Needle and Thread Alley</ENAMEX>. Stockdale was an extremely industrious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> and also a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foresight</ENAMEX>, as he also organized and ran the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> postal service on the island.
Continue along <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Duke</ENAMEX> of Kent Street and you will come to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unfinished Church</ENAMEX>, an elegant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">edifice</ENAMEX> originally begun in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1870s</TIMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Peter‚Äôs Church</ENAMEX> was badly damaged by a storm and thought to be beyond repair. As construction proceeded, however, the local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> decided that they would rather invest their money in repairing the old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> and work on the unfinished <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> was immediately stopped. Had the church been completed, it would have been a fitting place of worship. 
Continue to the right of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unfinished Church</ENAMEX>, up <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Government Hill Road</ENAMEX> and through the rolling fairways of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">St. George‚Äôs Golf Course</ENAMEX>, one of the most challenging on the island, until you reach the coast. Here you will find <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tobacco Bay</ENAMEX>, a small stretch of sheltered beach popular with the cruise <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> who disembark at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. George‚Äôs</ENAMEX> and want to spend time sunbathing. It was here in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1775</TIMEX> that <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100 barrels</NUMEX> of gunpowder mysteriously disappeared from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fort St. Catherine</ENAMEX> and found their way onto a boat bound for the use of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">revolutionaries</ENAMEX>.
Drive past the sheltered inlet of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coot Pond</ENAMEX> to reach <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Fort St. Catherine</ENAMEX> itself. (Or you can take a minibus, which runs from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">King‚Äôs Square</ENAMEX> to the fort every <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15 minutes</TIMEX>.) The setting of the fort¬†‚Äî¬†on a rocky promontory with sandy beaches on both <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">flanks¬†‚Äî¬†is</ENAMEX> spectacular, with strong walls rising on all sides. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">fort</ENAMEX> was begun <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">as early as 1614</TIMEX> but has been upgraded throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bermuda‚</ENAMEX>Äôs history. Major renovations took place in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1793, 1820</TIMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1840</TIMEX> as technology improved and weaponry developed. The last major upgrade was completed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1878</TIMEX>. Explore the outer walls and impressive battlements before visiting the exhibitions housed in the interior. Collections of antique <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX>, including swords and muskets, outline the progress made in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX> technology. Replicas of the crown jewels housed in the Tower of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> can also be found here. An audiovisual presentation gives a comprehensive overview of all the fortifications on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bermuda</ENAMEX>.
There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> other small fortifications to the south of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Fort St. Catherine</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander Battery</ENAMEX> lies halfway along <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barry Road</ENAMEX>, and the tiny <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Gates Fort</ENAMEX> sits at the mouth of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Town Cut</ENAMEX>, the navigation route for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> entering <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. George‚Äôs Harbour</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gates Fort</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> appeared on maps as <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚ÄúDanver‚Äôs Fort‚</ENAMEX>Äù in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1626</TIMEX>. It became obsolete in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th century</TIMEX> and was used as a family <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1870 until 1922</TIMEX> before being restored by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>. The site, once used to stop <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">suspect</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enemy boats</ENAMEX> from entering the harbor, is now a great place to welcome the large cruise <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX> making their way into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bermuda</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Town Cut</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only a few hundred</NUMEX> feet across; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX> dwarf the surrounding islands and appear to pass through with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only inches</NUMEX> on either side. One wonders what the old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defenders</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gates Fort</ENAMEX> would have felt about these huge vessels looming upon them. It is a truly exhilarating sight.
