A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BRIEF HISTORY OF POLAND</ENAMEX>
Poland‚Äôs war-torn and almost incomprehensibly fractured history plays out like an <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">epic novel¬†‚Äî¬†occasionally triumphant</ENAMEX>, frequently sad and tragic. Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a millennium</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX> evolved from a huge and imposing, economically powerful <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">kingdom</ENAMEX> to a partitioned <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> that ceased to exist on world maps for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">over 120 years</TIMEX>, and finally to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and land at the center of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">20th</NUMEX> century‚Äôs greatest wars and most horrific human tragedies. But <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX> has survived, with its culture, language and most of its territory intact, and today <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Poles</ENAMEX> look forward with optimism to taking their place at the forefront of the new, post-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Communist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Central Europe</ENAMEX>.
Foundations of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Polish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State</ENAMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> that would become <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX>, a great plain sandwiched between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vistula</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Odra</ENAMEX> rivers, has been inhabited since the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stone Age</ENAMEX> by migratory tribal peoples¬†‚Äî¬†among them <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Celts, Balts, Huns, Slavs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mongols</ENAMEX>. Tribal culture reigned, untouched by the more sophisticated civilization of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Empire</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Slavic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tribes</ENAMEX> arrived by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the eighth century</TIMEX> a.d. and put down roots; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Ä¢lezanie</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mazowszanie, Pomorzanie</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Wislanie</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peoples</ENAMEX> inhabited much of the territory. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Polonian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tribe</ENAMEX>, which settled the area that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> is western <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX> around <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poznan</ENAMEX>, provided the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">foundations</ENAMEX> for the development of a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Polish</ENAMEX> language and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prince Mieszko</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Piast</ENAMEX> dynasty that ruled the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Polonians</ENAMEX>, undertook the bold step to unify the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Polanie</ENAMEX> (literally, ‚Äúpeople of the fields‚Äù) and neighboring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tribes</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mieszko</ENAMEX> adopted <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Christianity¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†most likely a savvy political move to place the new state on equal footing with nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> with ties to <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Rome¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†and married a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Czech</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">princess</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dobrava</ENAMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">965</TIMEX>. His religious conversion won him the support of the papacy, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mieszko</ENAMEX> effectively founded the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Polish</ENAMEX> state <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the following year</TIMEX>. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the 10th century</TIMEX>, he had united his tribal territory, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wielkopolska</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Great Poland</ENAMEX>), with that of another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tribe</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malopolska</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Little Poland</ENAMEX>)¬<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">†‚Äî¬†regional</ENAMEX> names that remain current <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Silesia</ENAMEX>, settled by a different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tribe</ENAMEX>, would eventually become the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> component of the nascent <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Polish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. 
Mieszko‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boleslaw ‚ÄúThe Brave‚Äù</ENAMEX> was crowned by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Otto III</ENAMEX>, the Holy <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Emperor</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boleslaw</ENAMEX> later repelled invasions from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Otto‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">successor</ENAMEX> and then sought <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Poland‚</ENAMEX>Äôs own expansion eastward; he eventually annexed parts of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">present-day</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ukraine</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pope</ENAMEX> recognized <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boleslaw</ENAMEX> as the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1025</TIMEX>, elevating the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> to full membership in a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Duke Boleslaw Krzywousty</ENAMEX> divided the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">provinces</ENAMEX> to be ruled by his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sons</ENAMEX>. Krak√≥w grew in importance and eventually became the country‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 12th century</TIMEX> (replacing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gniezno</ENAMEX>), when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Duke Boleslaw ‚Äúthe Wry Mouthed‚</ENAMEX>Äù established his official <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Wawel Hill</ENAMEX>. Krak√≥w was better positioned for trade and also less vulnerable to attacks from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Czechs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Germans</ENAMEX>. Helped by the arrival of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX> from all over <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krak√≥w</ENAMEX> became a prosperous and culturally enriched capital. 
Beginning in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-13th century</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tartars</ENAMEX> invaded <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX> on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> occasions. Threatened by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prussians</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Duke Konrad</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mazovia</ENAMEX> invited the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Order of the Teutonic Knights</ENAMEX> in to help defend against them. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Knights</ENAMEX> used their considerable military might to then assume control of the very territory they had helped defend, capturing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gdansk</ENAMEX>, securing most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Baltic region</ENAMEX> and cutting off the rest of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX> from access to the sea. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tartars</ENAMEX> defeated the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Poles</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Battle of Legnica</ENAMEX> and destroyed most of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Krak√≥w</ENAMEX>, leaving only the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Andrew‚Äôs Church</ENAMEX> intact. 
Kazimierz the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Great</ENAMEX> & the Jagiellonians
The last <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Piast</ENAMEX> dynasty, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kazimierz the Great</ENAMEX>, succeeded in reunifying <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX>. His rule ushered in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland‚</ENAMEX>Äôs first golden age. Kazimierz built great castles and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX>, codified laws, and created an entire administrative system of governance for the war-torn <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. He rebuilt <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Krak√≥w</ENAMEX> with magnificent architecture and established the country‚Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">university</ENAMEX> there. Kazimierz, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pragmatist</ENAMEX>, did not try to wrest control of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Silesia</ENAMEX>, in the hands of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bohemia</ENAMEX>, or the territory seized by the independent <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Teutonic Knights</ENAMEX>. Instead, he consolidated the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> by expanding eastward and accepting minority <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>, including persecuted <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> from across <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, into the predominantly <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catholic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>.
Kazimierz‚Äôs death in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1370</TIMEX> left the crown to his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nephew</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Louis of Anjou</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">King of Hungary</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughters</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jadwiga</ENAMEX>, succeeded <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX>, while the other assumed control of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hungary</ENAMEX>. Jadwiga‚Äôs <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1386</TIMEX> marriage to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jagiello</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Grand Duke</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lithuania</ENAMEX>, led to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Poland‚</ENAMEX>Äôs strategic alliance with that powerful <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. After his wife‚Äôs death, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jagiello</ENAMEX> ruled both <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lithuania</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly half</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a century</TIMEX>, establishing a dynasty that would remain in power until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1572</TIMEX>. The united <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> defeated the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Teutonic Knights</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Battle of Grunwald</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1410</TIMEX> and repelled Germanic eastward expansion. The <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Thirteen Years‚Äô War</ENAMEX> yielded great benefits for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX>: the transformation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Danzig</ENAMEX> (formerly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gdansk</ENAMEX>) into an independent <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>-state under the protection of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Polish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crown</ENAMEX> and the capture of other <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Knights territories</ENAMEX>. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Polish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nobles</ENAMEX> saw their political might expanded during the beginning of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">king‚Äôs ‚Äúrule</ENAMEX> of the nobility,‚Äù which granted exclusive right to enact legislation to nobles in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parliament</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sejm</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">1500s</NUMEX> were a time of prosperity, power, and cultural and scientific achievement for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Polish</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lithuanian Commonwealth</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1543</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nicholas Copernicus</ENAMEX>, born in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toru¬¥n</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">graduate</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jagiellonian University</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Krak√≥w</ENAMEX>, published his groundbreaking and astronomy-altering treatise, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">De</ENAMEX> revolutionibus orbium <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Coeliestium</ENAMEX>, which positioned the sun and not the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">earth</ENAMEX> as the center of the universe. Although the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reformation</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lutherism</ENAMEX> had an impact on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> largely avoided the devastating religious wars that raged elsewhere in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sejm</ENAMEX> moved to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Warsaw</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1569</TIMEX>, and the death of the last <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ruler</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jagiellonian</ENAMEX> dynasty, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zygmunt</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August</TIMEX>, led to the creation of a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Republic of Nobles</ENAMEX> and an elective monarchy that would serve it. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Warsaw</ENAMEX>, more strategically located in the center of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, became the official capital of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1596</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">King Sigismund Vasa</ENAMEX> moved the royal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Krak√≥w‚Äôs Wawel Hill</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Warsaw</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1609</TIMEX>. 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Swedes</ENAMEX> Are Coming
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> successive elected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">kings</ENAMEX> emerged from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Waza</ENAMEX> dynasty of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sweden</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sweden</ENAMEX> had become the strongest military power in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> after the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Thirty Years‚Äô War</ENAMEX>, and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-17th century</TIMEX>, it set its expansionist sights on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Swedes</ENAMEX> invaded <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1648</TIMEX>, an event labeled <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the ‚ÄúSwedish Deluge‚Äù</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Polish</ENAMEX> history books. The devastating war lasted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five years</TIMEX>, during which time <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sweden</ENAMEX> was able to capture most of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX>. The war and the disastrous effects of the plague decimated the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX>, reducing it to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">just four million</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">roughly half</NUMEX> its total in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 17th century</TIMEX>. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Remarkably</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX> retained enough military might to repel the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottoman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turks</ENAMEX> in their advance through the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Balkans</ENAMEX>. The military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jan Sobieski</ENAMEX> defeated <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Battle of Chocim</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1673</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sobieski</ENAMEX> would later be credited with saving <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vienna</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> (and thwarting the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottoman Empire‚</ENAMEX>Äôs designs on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Western Europe</ENAMEX>). Sobieski was elected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX>, but his attentions to battles against the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turks</ENAMEX> at the expense of domestic affairs did not bode well for him and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX>. 
Decline and Partitioning
At <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the beginning of the 18th century</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX> entered a prolonged period of decline, marked by financial ruin, a debilitated military, and a series of ineffectual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">kings</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX> was transformed into a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client</ENAMEX> state of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russians</ENAMEX>, and then lost much of its western <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">territory</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prussians</ENAMEX> during the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Silesian Wars</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that ended in 1763</TIMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">The following year</TIMEX> Stanislaw <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">August Poniatowski</ENAMEX> was elected the last <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Polish</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lithuanian Commonwealth</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX> soon faced one of its most humiliating episodes.
The powerful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prussians</ENAMEX> came up with a plan to partition <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX>, which gained the support of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russians</ENAMEX>. The imposed treaty in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1772</TIMEX> robbed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly a third</NUMEX> of its lands. Yet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Poniatowski</ENAMEX> recovered to preside over a reform movement that precipitated the creation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1791 Constitution</ENAMEX>, which restored the hereditary monarchy and overhauled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Poland‚</ENAMEX>Äôs political system. The liberal constitution, the oldest in the modern world after that of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, provided for the separation of powers among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">legislative</ENAMEX>, judicial and executive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branches</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>. 
None of these reforms pleased the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russians</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prussians</ENAMEX>, who continued to covet <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Polish</ENAMEX> territory. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> invaded <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX> and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1792-1793</TIMEX> it, along with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Prussia</ENAMEX>, imposed a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> partition of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX>, annulling the constitution and essentially divying up the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> between them. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tadeusz Ko¬ßciuszko</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hero</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">American War of Independence</ENAMEX>, led a military insurrection in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1794</TIMEX>, defeating the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russians</ENAMEX> with a mostly peasant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX>. The uprising was quashed, however, and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1795</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Poniatowski</ENAMEX> was forced to abdicate. A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partition</ENAMEX> crushed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX> and placed the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> under the control of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Austria</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Prussia</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX> ceased to exist¬†‚Äî¬†its very name was abolished by treaty¬†‚Äî¬†for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next 123 years</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Warsaw</ENAMEX> went to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Prussia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Krak√≥w</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Austria</ENAMEX>.
In desperation, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX> looked to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Napoleon Bonaparte</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Revolutionary France</ENAMEX> for assistance against its oppressors. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Napoleon</ENAMEX> defeated the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Prussian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX> in several key battles and established a semi-independent <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Duchy</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Warsaw</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1807 to 1815</TIMEX>. Napoleon gained an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ally</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">J√≥zef Poniatowski</ENAMEX>, a heralded military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nephew</ENAMEX> of the last <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">1812 Polish War</ENAMEX> re-established the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lithuania</ENAMEX> border, but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Napoleon‚Äôs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> were crushed as they advanced on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moscow</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Napoleon</ENAMEX> suffered a great defeat, but his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ally</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Poniatowski</ENAMEX> refused to surrender, preferring to sacrifice himself and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX>. The suicidal mission became an important rallying cry for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Poles</ENAMEX> during the remainder of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th century</TIMEX>. 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vienna</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1815</TIMEX>, with an aim to reorganize <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Napoleon‚</ENAMEX>Äôs escapades, did not re-establish an independent <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX>. Rather, it again partitioned the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, placing the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">territory</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Duchy</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Warsaw</ENAMEX> under the control of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">czar</ENAMEX>. For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three decades</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Krak√≥w</ENAMEX> existed as an independent <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>-state, though it was again incorporated into the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Austrian</ENAMEX> partition in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1846</TIMEX>.
The former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Duchy</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Warsaw</ENAMEX>, called the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress Kingdom</ENAMEX>, enjoyed some autonomy and prosperity in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 19th century</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Poles</ENAMEX> launched a series of armed insurrections against its occupiers in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1830</TIMEX> and, after defeat, again in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1846 and 1863</TIMEX>. The last rebellion counted on support from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> that never arrived. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Poles</ENAMEX>, fearful that an independent <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX> would never again be realized, emigrated to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> and then the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> during this period. Those who remained focused on preserving <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Polish</ENAMEX> language and culture if not the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Polish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Aftermath of World War I</ENAMEX>
The next pivotal episode in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Polish</ENAMEX> history coincided with the end of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War I</ENAMEX> and the defeat of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russians</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Germans</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Austrians</ENAMEX>. The partition of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX> collapsed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1918</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Poland‚</ENAMEX>Äôs bid for independence won the support of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Woodrow Wilson</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Bolshevik</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Polish</ENAMEX> war <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hero</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J√≥zef Pilsudski</ENAMEX>, released from a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prison</ENAMEX>, took control of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX>. Yet <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">just two years later</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviets</ENAMEX> invaded and surrounded <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Warsaw</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pilsudski</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> managed to hold back the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviets</ENAMEX>.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1926</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pilsudski</ENAMEX> engineered a military coup and seized control under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sanacja</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">senate</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> that would rule until the start of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War</ENAMEX> II. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1933</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX> was sandwiched between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">dictatorships</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stalin</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> on the eastern border, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hitler</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nazi Germany</ENAMEX> to the west. Both fixed their eyes on occupying <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX>, and they signed the ruthless <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Nazi</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pact</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1939</TIMEX>, which stated that either would be free to pursue expansionist acts without the interference of the other. In the agreement was a secret clause providing for the eventual full partition of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX> between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Russia¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†even though <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX> had signed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10-year</TIMEX> non-aggression pacts with both.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nazi Invasion</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX> & the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Holocaust</ENAMEX>
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 1939</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Nazis</ENAMEX> invaded <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX>. The annexation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Danzig</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gdansk</ENAMEX>) marked the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> start of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War</ENAMEX> II. Soon after, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> launched an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">occupation</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Krak√≥w</ENAMEX>, where they based their governing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>, and laid siege to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Warsaw</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviets</ENAMEX> invaded <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">less than 10 days later</TIMEX>, following the terms of the pact signed with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Nazis</ENAMEX> initiated a ruthless campaign in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1940</TIMEX>, rounding up <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intellectuals</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX>, and others, executing some in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> and deporting others to concentration <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camps</ENAMEX> in the occupied territory. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Germans</ENAMEX> constructed walled <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ghettoes</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Warsaw</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Krak√≥w</ENAMEX>. At death <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">camps</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Auschwitz</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Birkenau</ENAMEX>, near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Krak√≥w</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nazis</ENAMEX> eventually murdered <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Poles</ENAMEX>, as well as other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prisoners</ENAMEX> from across <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviets</ENAMEX> themselves imprisoned some <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Poles</ENAMEX> in labor <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camps</ENAMEX> of their own and eliminated potential ‚Äútroublemakers‚Äù through actions like the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Katyn</ENAMEX> massacre, in which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,500</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Polish</ENAMEX> military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> were summarily executed. 
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">From 1941 to 1944</TIMEX>, all of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX> fell under <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Nazi</ENAMEX> occupation, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> became the focus of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hitler‚Äôs</ENAMEX> campaign to exterminate all <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> and non-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Aryans</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hitler</ENAMEX> invaded the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1941</TIMEX>, an act that drew the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviets</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Poles</ENAMEX> together in a shaky <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">alliance</ENAMEX>.
A heroic uprising in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1943</TIMEX>, led by poorly armed <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Warsaw</ENAMEX> ghetto, lasted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a month</TIMEX> until <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Nazi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reinforcements</ENAMEX> annihilated it and reported back to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> that ‚ÄúWarsaw‚Äôs <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Jewish quarter</TIMEX> has ceased to exist.‚Äù The following <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Poland‚Äôs Home Army</ENAMEX> initiated a surprise attack against the occupying <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Nazis</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Warsaw</ENAMEX>, and awaited assistance from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Red Army</ENAMEX>, perched on the outskirts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX>. The military support never came, and as his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> fled the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> after quashing the insurgency, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hitler</ENAMEX> ordered them to raze <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Warsaw</ENAMEX> building<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">-by-</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> and thereby annihilate important monuments of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Polish</ENAMEX> culture. When the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviets</ENAMEX> entered the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, they found it reduced to rubble and ashes.
The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War</ENAMEX> was more devastating for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX> than any other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Six million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Poles</ENAMEX> lost their lives during <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> was decimated, reduced from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3 million</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">just a couple thousand</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX> lost a significant amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">territory</ENAMEX> after new borders were drawn up in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Yalta Agreement</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1945</TIMEX>, including the eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">regions</ENAMEX> around <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilno</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vilnius</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lw√≥w</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lvov</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Polish</ENAMEX> borders shifted west <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a couple of hundred kilometers</NUMEX>, incorporating ancient parts of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Silesia</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wroclaw</ENAMEX> that had belonged to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> before the war. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX> also regained <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Danzig</ENAMEX>, which had not been a part of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX> since its seizure by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Teutonic Knights</ENAMEX>. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Communism & Soviet Domination</ENAMEX> 
In the aftermath of the war, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX> was <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Sovietized</ENAMEX>, with the installation of a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX>-friendly <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">communist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>, the nationalization of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX>, confiscation of church property, and forced exile of political and religious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX>. With <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> aid, a rebuilding program was initiated, an effort that reconstructed the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Old Towns</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Warsaw</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gdansk</ENAMEX>, among others, in costly and meticulous efforts based on paintings, photographs and architectural drawings. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> signaled its domination over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1955 ‚Äúgift‚</ENAMEX>Äù of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palace of Culture and Science</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Warsaw</ENAMEX>, a monstrous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">skyscraper</ENAMEX> that would become a hated symbol of foreign influence. 
Many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Poles</ENAMEX>, especially among the intellectual and professional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX>, opposed <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> influence and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Communist</ENAMEX> rule, and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1956</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX> faced its <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> real test. Worker strikes and protests erupted in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poznan</ENAMEX>, and spread into armed confrontations in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>. Security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> opened fire on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rioters</ENAMEX> and killed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 80</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. A weakened and suddenly unstable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Communist Party</ENAMEX> installed former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gomulka</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> without consulting <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moscow</ENAMEX>, an event that prompted <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">East German</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Czech</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> to amass on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Polish</ENAMEX> borders. A similar uprising occurred in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hungary</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the same year</TIMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviets</ENAMEX> invaded to quickly crush it.
But the episode in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX>, called <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Polish October</TIMEX>, exposed fissures in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Communist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>, and it served as the impetus for a slight relaxation of censorship, religious repression, and economic controls. Reforms stalled, however, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the following decade</TIMEX> saw a return to strict <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> doctrine. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">1970s</NUMEX> were marked by inflation and the emphatic snuffing of strikes and protests. Living standards dropped dramatically, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> was forced to prop up the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Polish</ENAMEX> economy. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pope John Paul II</ENAMEX> & <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Solidarity</ENAMEX>
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1978</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Polish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Cardinal</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Archbishop</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Krak√≥w Karol Wojtyla</ENAMEX> was elected <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pope</ENAMEX>; he took the name <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Paul</ENAMEX> II. A staunch <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponent</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Communist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wojtyla</ENAMEX> returned to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1979</TIMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pope</ENAMEX> and drew great, thunderous crowds at every stop. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">The following year</TIMEX>, unrest grew among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> after <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> increases in food prices. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lech Walesa</ENAMEX>, a shipyard <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">electrician</ENAMEX>, led worker strikes in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gdansk</ENAMEX>. The size and vehemence of their protests, which spread countrywide, forced the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> to negotiate with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Solidarno¬ß¬ø</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Solidarity</ENAMEX>) trade <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">union</ENAMEX>, granting its workers‚Äô demands and allowing free trade <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unions</ENAMEX> limited autonomy to oversee their industries. Viewed from hindsight, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Solidarity</ENAMEX> was critical in establishing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">foundations</ENAMEX> for opposition to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Communist</ENAMEX> rule across <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Central</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eastern Europe</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Wojciech Jaruzelski</ENAMEX> adopted a hard line and declared martial law in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 1981</TIMEX> in response to continued strikes across <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX>. He initiated a military takeover of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Communist Party</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> arrested <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Solidarity</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activists</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sympathizers</ENAMEX>, banned the trade <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">union</ENAMEX>, and suspended civil rights. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Two years later</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX> lifted martial law after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pope‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> visit to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lech Walesa</ENAMEX> won the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Nobel Peace Prize</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1983</TIMEX>, familiarizing the world with the struggles of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Polish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>. The government‚Äôs resolve did not abate, however. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1984</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Polish</ENAMEX> secret police murdered <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Father</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerzy Popieluszko</ENAMEX>, an outspoken <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supporter</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Solidarno¬ß¬ø.</ENAMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Warsaw</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priest</ENAMEX> had been set to be beatified by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catholic Church¬</ENAMEX>†‚Äî¬†on his way to becoming a saint. 
The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-1980s</TIMEX> witnessed a gradual program of liberalization in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX> on the heels of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mikhail Gorbachev‚</ENAMEX>Äôs remarkable perestroika and glasnost in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Soviet Union</ENAMEX>, the promises of greater openness and economic freedoms. The economic crisis in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX> persisted, though, and mass strikes were staged, even as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> visited <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX>, talks established the basis for limited power-sharing between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Communist Party</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Solidarity</ENAMEX>. 
The End of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Communist Rule</ENAMEX>
Desperate austerity measures failed to jump-start the economy. In semi-free elections, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Solidarity</ENAMEX> was the overwhelming <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victor</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Communist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX> collapsed. On <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 1990</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Poles</ENAMEX> made <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lech Walesa</ENAMEX> the first popularly elected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">post-World War II</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX>, a watershed event for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">bloc</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nations</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walesa</ENAMEX> met with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pope</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vatican</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Warsaw Pact</ENAMEX> was dissolved. 
Poland‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> to capitalism and democracy has been a complicated one. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walesa</ENAMEX> fell out of favor with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Poles</ENAMEX> and was defeated in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX> elections. But by that time, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> had joined the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Trade</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Union</ENAMEX> had agreed to open negotiations to admit <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX> (along with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Czech Republic</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hungary</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Slovakia</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Slovenia</ENAMEX>) into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX>. 
By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the 20th century</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX> had joined <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX>, and a decision on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX> membership was expected by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX> is thought by most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> to be among the few <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> that will be allowed to join in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> round of decisions. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 1999</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pope John Paul II</ENAMEX> visited his <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">homeland</ENAMEX> for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">eighth</NUMEX> time as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pope</ENAMEX>, and he was again received by enormous crowds, proof once again that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Poland‚Äôs</ENAMEX> committed <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catholics</ENAMEX> and fervent patriots had survived the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Communist</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> with their faith and pride intact.
