A Brief History
Throughout the centuries-old history of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico‚Äôs Pacific Coast</ENAMEX>, this region has been both a refuge and an important point for conducting trade.
The region‚Äôs history has some marked differences from the history of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> as a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. Although artifacts show that both the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Aztec</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Olmec</ENAMEX> pre-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanic</ENAMEX> cultures had a presence in the area, ancient civilizations created no notable settlements here. This fact, coupled with the geography of the region, spared it much of the bloodshed and turmoil of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> conquest. With the imposing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sierra Madre Occidental</ENAMEX> mountain range running the length of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific</ENAMEX> coastline, isolating it from the rest of mainland <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific</ENAMEX> coast was able to develop at a slower, more tranquil pace.
Most pre-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tribes</ENAMEX> that inhabited the coastal areas were peaceful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fishermen</ENAMEX>, and their trading legacy continued well after the conquest of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>. Several of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ports</ENAMEX> that were important prior to the conquest have¬†‚Äî¬†in one way or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">another¬†‚Äî¬†remained</ENAMEX> on the map as major destinations to this day.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Puerto</ENAMEX> Vallarta
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Puerto Vallarta</ENAMEX> was launched into the international spotlight when <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Huston</ENAMEX> decided to film the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tennessee Williams‚</ENAMEX>Äô play, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Night of the Iguana</ENAMEX>, on nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mismaloya Beach</ENAMEX>. Its history, however, runs much deeper than that event. Recent archeological findings show <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> different cultures lived in the area, with settlements dating back to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> b.c. The most important was part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">kingdom</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xalisco</ENAMEX>, centered in the modern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nayarit</ENAMEX>. A marked <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Aztec</ENAMEX> influence is also present, probably due to the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX>-long migration of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aztecs</ENAMEX> from the legendary <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aztl√°n</ENAMEX>, on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific</ENAMEX> coast, to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tenochtitlan</ENAMEX>, present-day <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico City</ENAMEX>. Remains of these cultures can be seen in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museo del R√≠o Cuale</ENAMEX>.
The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spaniard</ENAMEX> to encounter these <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Nahuatl</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">settlements</ENAMEX> was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hern√°n Cortez‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nephew</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francisco Cortez de Buenaventura</ENAMEX>. He arrived at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jalisco-Nayarit</ENAMEX> coast in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1524</TIMEX>, shortly after the fall of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tenochtitlan</ENAMEX>. He was met by ‚Äú‚Ä¶a formidable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">warriors</ENAMEX>, their bows decorated by myriad colored banners‚Ä¶‚Äù This impressive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> earned the fertile <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">R√≠o Ameca Valley</ENAMEX> (just north of present day <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Vallarta</ENAMEX>) the name <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Valle de Banderas</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valley of the Banners</ENAMEX>), and the great bay just in front of the valley became known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Bah√≠a de Banderas</ENAMEX>.
During colonial <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> the bay was visited by both <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">galleons</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pirate ships</ENAMEX> looking for shelter, repairs, or supplies. It was during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this time</TIMEX> that foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">navigators</ENAMEX> referred to the bay as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Humpback Bay</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Bah√≠a de las Jorobadas</ENAMEX>, because of the large number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">humpback whales</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">appeared¬†‚Äî¬†and</ENAMEX> still appear¬†‚Äî¬†every <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX>.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1800s</TIMEX> gold and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">silver</ENAMEX> were found in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sierra Madre Mountains</ENAMEX>, spurring an explosive growth of mining <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Talpa de Allende</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Sebasti√°n</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mines</ENAMEX> needed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX> to process the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ore</ENAMEX>, and an enterprising <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guadalupe S√°nchez</ENAMEX> found the perfect location for this by the mouth of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">R√≠o Cuale</ENAMEX>. He and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> became the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">suppliers</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cuale</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Sebasti√</ENAMEX>°n <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">silver</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mines</ENAMEX>. Others arrived to take part in this lucrative trade, and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1851</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX>, called <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Las Pe√±as</ENAMEX>, was established.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> grew steadily, and by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1895</TIMEX> construction began on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town center</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iglesia de Nuestra Se√±ora de Guadalupe</ENAMEX>, named after the Virgin of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guadalupe</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patron saint</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S√°nchez</ENAMEX> originally founded the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 12th</TIMEX>, the anniversary of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virgin‚Äôs</ENAMEX> appearance.
As <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Las Pe√±as</ENAMEX> grew, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Sebasti√</ENAMEX>°n faded. At its peak in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 1800s</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Sebasti√</ENAMEX>°n was one of the most productive mining <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> in all <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>, with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">over 20,000</NUMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> it has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fewer than 2,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX>). In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1912</TIMEX>, governmental functions were moved to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Las Pe√±as</ENAMEX>, and by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1819</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Pe√±as</ENAMEX> was designated as a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">municipality</ENAMEX>, and its name changed to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Vallarta</ENAMEX>.
Without any <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">highways</ENAMEX> or an airport to connect it to other major <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Vallarta</ENAMEX> remained in secluded tranquility for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost 50</NUMEX> years¬<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">†‚Äî¬†until the 1963 filming of Night of the Iguana</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX> production attracted the attention of the international media, who came looking for gossip about the torrid romances of the film‚Äôs legendary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stars</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Night</TIMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iguana‚</ENAMEX>Äôs biggest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">star</ENAMEX>, however, turned out to be the quaint village of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Vallarta</ENAMEX>.
The movie‚Äôs leading <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Burton</ENAMEX>, and his new love, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elizabeth Taylor</ENAMEX>, were so charmed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> that they bought <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> there, as did <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Huston</ENAMEX>. Throngs of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> followed. Many became <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX>, building <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> of their own on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hillsides</ENAMEX> overlooking the river and bay, creating what is now known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gringo Gulch</ENAMEX>. Huston‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guillermo Wulff</ENAMEX> built most of these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX>, giving <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Vallarta</ENAMEX> its defining style of white facades and red tile roofs.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Puerto Vallarta</ENAMEX> has continued to grow, and has become an important art <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>. It attracts an increasing number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> to its true <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> ambiance, coupled with a modern resort environment.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manzanillo</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Costa</ENAMEX> Alegre
Since its earliest <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manzanillo</ENAMEX> has been considered an important trading <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Legend</ENAMEX> has it that the ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> of the area, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colimans</ENAMEX>, who traded from this <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">port¬†‚Äî¬†then</ENAMEX> known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tzalagua¬†‚Äî¬†had</ENAMEX> contact with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> before the arrival of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spaniards</ENAMEX>.
When this rumor reached <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cortez</ENAMEX>, he sent his own <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> to confirm it. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spaniards</ENAMEX> named the place <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manzanillo</ENAMEX>, and established it as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shipyard</ENAMEX> and launching point for expeditions across the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific</ENAMEX>. Its bay offered safe anchorage and a good shipbuilding <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">site</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manzanillo</ENAMEX> saw considerable growth until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-1500s</TIMEX>, when, in order to centralize trade, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Acapulco</ENAMEX> was declared the only authorized <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manzanillo</ENAMEX> continued to quietly exist until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1889</TIMEX>, when a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">railroad</ENAMEX> connected it inland. Telephone, electricity, drainage, and potable <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> services followed. These improvements helped transform <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manzanillo</ENAMEX> into the modern <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX> and manufacturing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> it is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manzanillo</ENAMEX> initially drew the interest of international <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> for its excellent fishing. An important annual fishing tournament prompted the construction of modest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">condos</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1970s</TIMEX>, the development, along with the new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX>, of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Club Maeva and Las Hadas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX>, with their striking <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Moorish</ENAMEX> design, began to bring in a steady flow of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX>. Then the movie Ten, starring <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bo Derek</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dudley Moore</ENAMEX> and filmed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Hadas</ENAMEX>, put <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manzanillo</ENAMEX> squarely in the spotlight.
The beaches and coves along the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Costa Alegre</ENAMEX>, were also popular with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pirates</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">400 years ago</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Melaque</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barra de Navidad</ENAMEX> were visited in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1523</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> conquistadors in search of a mythical place believed to have an unlimited quantity of pearls, and to be inhabited only by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. A select number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> discovered <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Melaque</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barra de Navidad</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1950s</TIMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> have grown gracefully since.
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Ixtapa‚ÄìZihuatanejo: From Pre-Hispanic Resort to Modern Paradise</ENAMEX>
Zihuatanejo‚Äôs azure waters caught the attention of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> long before <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> became a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> colonial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Legend</ENAMEX> has it that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tarascan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emperor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Caltzonzin</ENAMEX> built a royal beach retreat on the popular <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Zihuatanejo</ENAMEX> beach of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Las Gatas</ENAMEX>, somewhere around a.d. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1400</TIMEX>. He turned this already tranquil beach into a virtual wading pool by building a breakwater to keep the waters within it completely calm and crystalline. The mysterious <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Olmecs</ENAMEX>, from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gulf Coast of Mexico</ENAMEX>, left their unmistakable influence here around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX> b.c., evidenced by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ceramics</ENAMEX> featuring jaguar-like and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Negroid</ENAMEX> features. Today, some of these may be seen in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museo Arqueol√≥gico de la Costa Grande</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Zihuatanejo</ENAMEX>.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1500s</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aztecs</ENAMEX> conquered the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coyuca</ENAMEX>, located between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">present-day</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Zihuatanejo</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coyuca</ENAMEX> lagoon, and established a coastal <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX>, which they called <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Zihuatlan, ‚ÄúPlace of Women</ENAMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äù</ENAMEX> named for the local matriarchal society. Residents <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> claim that the place was named for the beauty of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, and means, ‚Äúplace of beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>.‚Äù
Zihuatanejo was claimed for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crown</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Juan Alvarez Chico</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1522</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> and port saw little action during colonial <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> and it slumbered quietly, hosting a few lost galleons and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pirate ships</ENAMEX> that happened to stop for repairs or supplies. Local lore tells how one such <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ship</ENAMEX>, upon returning from its travels to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>, lost <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds of</NUMEX> rolls of silk. The name <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">La Ropa (‚Äúthe Clothing‚Äù</ENAMEX>) was given to the beach where the silk later washed ashore.
It wasn‚Äôt until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">over 400 years later</TIMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-1960s</TIMEX>, that this quiet village was awakened with the development of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ixtapa</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FONATUR</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mexico‚Äôs</ENAMEX> national fund for tourism development) chose this location because of its <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">7.5 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 miles</NUMEX>) of pristine beaches, located near a picturesque village. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> Zihuatanejo and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ixtapa</ENAMEX> meld into a complementary combination that offers the best of both worlds: the quirky <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zihuatanejo</ENAMEX> and the deluxe mega-development of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ixtapa</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Acapulco</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Colonial Gateway</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Orient and Playground</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stars</ENAMEX> 
Many regard <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Acapulco</ENAMEX> as the original <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> beach <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> with its glimmering beaches and glitzy nightlife. Yet its history extends far beyond its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">present-day</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">appeal¬†‚Äî¬†artifacts</ENAMEX> found here date back to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2500</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">b.c. Inhabitants</ENAMEX> of this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">zone</ENAMEX> are known to have traded with several cultures, possibly including the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Polynesians</ENAMEX>. There is clear evidence of trade with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tarascan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mixtec</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Zapotec</ENAMEX> empires that extended to the north and south of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Acapulco</ENAMEX> prior to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mexico‚</ENAMEX>Äôs conquest by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1528</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crown</ENAMEX> claimed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Acapulco</ENAMEX>, and established it as the departure point for a trade route to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Orient</ENAMEX>. A later decree gave <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Acapulco</ENAMEX> exclusivity as the only authorized <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific</ENAMEX> coast, and for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">200 years</TIMEX>, it was the unrivaled trading <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">center</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific Mexico</ENAMEX>. The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yearly</TIMEX> arrival of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nao de China</ENAMEX>, a galleon that sailed to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manila</ENAMEX> and back during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these years</TIMEX>, was the occasion for an annual merchant fair that drew <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> from all over the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX>.
Before long, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pirates</ENAMEX> heard about the riches brought to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Acapulco¬†‚Äî¬†the port</ENAMEX> was visited both by Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis Drake</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British pirate</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Cavendish</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cavendish</ENAMEX> eventually captured the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nao</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1587</TIMEX>) and got away with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.2 million</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX>. To guard the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port</ENAMEX> from these attacks, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spaniards</ENAMEX> built the impressive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fuerte de San Diego</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1616</TIMEX>. Although an earthquake destroyed it in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1776</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">fort</ENAMEX> was rebuilt in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1783</TIMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> houses a small but interesting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nao</ENAMEX> trade route continued until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1800s</TIMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Jos√© Mar√≠a Morelos y Pav√≥n, a hero of Mexico‚Äôs War of Independence</ENAMEX>, took over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Acapulco</ENAMEX> and stopped the trade, sending the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a century</TIMEX><TIMEX TYPE="TIME">-long</TIMEX> respite, a hiatus that ended only when the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> paved the highway between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico City</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Acapulco</ENAMEX>. The beautiful beaches of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Acapulco Bay</ENAMEX> immediately lured <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Mexico City‚Äôs elite, and the metamorphosis</ENAMEX> began, from slumbering trading <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port</ENAMEX> into the ‚ÄúPearl of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific</ENAMEX>,‚Äù as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> came to know it in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1930s</TIMEX>.
The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">airplanes</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> began to arrive in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-1930s</TIMEX>, and with them came a bevy of notorious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>, from movie <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stars</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">presidents</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">millionaires</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Acapulco</ENAMEX> became the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">playground</ENAMEX> for the rich and famous. Glitzy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> went up in a hurry, supported by new boulevards, power <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>, and a superhighway. Acapulco‚Äôs peak was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1940s</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1960s</TIMEX>. Celebrated images included <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Sinatra</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ava Gardner</ENAMEX> sipping margaritas while watching cliff <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">divers</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Quebrada</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eisenhower</ENAMEX> meeting Mexico‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L√≥pez Mateos</ENAMEX> for a summit conference in a new high rise <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnny Weissmuller</ENAMEX> swimming <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laps</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Flamingos Hotel</ENAMEX> pool overlooking <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Acapulco Bay</ENAMEX>.
Since those glory days <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Acapulco</ENAMEX> has aged¬†‚Äî¬†maybe not quite as gracefully as its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fans</ENAMEX> would have hoped. However, the ‚ÄúPerla <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">del Pac√≠fico‚Äù</ENAMEX> still attracts scores of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vacationers</ENAMEX>, who are still regaled by old stories about the rich and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">famous</ENAMEX>, told by seasoned <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">waiters</ENAMEX> as they serve pool-side drinks with a weathered but unwavering smile.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Puerto Escondido</ENAMEX> and Huatulco
Even though <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Escondido</ENAMEX> is the more mature tourist destination of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Huatulco</ENAMEX> has the deepest historical roots. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aztecs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chichimecs</ENAMEX> (a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nahuatl</ENAMEX>-speaking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">warrior community</ENAMEX>) knew <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Huatulco</ENAMEX> as an important trading port long before the arrival of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conquistadors</ENAMEX>.
The name <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Huatulco</ENAMEX> is of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Aztec</ENAMEX> origin and means ‚Äúland where a tree is worshipped,‚Äù reflecting the intriguing legend of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">‚ÄúSanta Cruz de Huatulco‚Äù (‚ÄúSacred Cross of Huatulco‚Äù</ENAMEX>). When the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spaniards</ENAMEX> arrived at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Huatulco</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 1530s</TIMEX>, the local <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indians</ENAMEX> showed them a massive cross by the edge of the shore that they worshipped. A legend arose that the cross may have been left by an ancient saint¬†‚Äî¬†perhaps even the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Apostle Thomas¬†‚Äî¬†some fifteen</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries earlier</TIMEX>. The cross remained during the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> conquest and even survived an attempt to destroy it by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pirate Cavendish</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1612</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bishop Juan de Cervantes</ENAMEX> took part of the cross to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oaxaca</ENAMEX> and used it as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">foundation</ENAMEX> of a replica, which <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> stands in the main altar of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">cathedral</ENAMEX>. Another piece was set in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">silver</ENAMEX> and sent to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Vatican</ENAMEX>.
For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX> the bays of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Huatulco</ENAMEX> basked quietly under the sun. Then, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-1970s</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FONATUR</ENAMEX> turned its eyes towards the southern coast of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oaxaca</ENAMEX> and started a mega-development, scheduled for completion in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2020</TIMEX>, on the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> bays of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Huatulco</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Puerto Escondido</ENAMEX> was established in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1928</TIMEX> as a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX> for shipping <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX>. Its importance diminished as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX> shipments began to be transported by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">truck</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> discovered the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> after it was connected to other coastal <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Highway 200</ENAMEX>. With its renowned offshore break, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Escondido</ENAMEX> became the ultimate destination for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">backpackers</ENAMEX>, flower <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">surfers</ENAMEX> looking for the perfect wave, and those attracted by natural beauty and the laid-back pace. True escapists preferred to continue south and visit <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Puerto Angel</ENAMEX>, a fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> that was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oaxaca‚</ENAMEX>Äôs busiest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX> for a brief period in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1870s</TIMEX>, before reverting back to its peaceable ways.
