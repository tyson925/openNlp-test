A Brief History
The first wave of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX> arrived <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">somewhere between 20,000 and 35,000</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> agoÂ<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE"> â€”Â wandering</ENAMEX> Asiatic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tribes</ENAMEX> who entered the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> continent via the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bering Strait</ENAMEX>, which at that time was dry land, or perhaps covered in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX>. In the succeeding <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX>, their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">descendants</ENAMEX> continued to push south and east, and eventually spread out to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> the whole of the continent from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alaska</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Patagonia</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tribes</ENAMEX> who decided to settle in what is now <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> were fortunate in their choice of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">homeland</ENAMEX>. The climate was very pleasant, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> was sufficiently plentiful for them to avoid the constant warfare that plagued many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tribes</ENAMEX> elsewhere in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Americas</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tribes</ENAMEX> lived in harmony with nature. Anticipating 1960s flower <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> seeking drug-induced enlightenment, medicine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> drank the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">juice</ENAMEX> of the jimson <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">weed</ENAMEX> to provoke revelatory hallucinations. However, not even their wildest visions prepared them for the arrival of bearded <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> armed with swords and crossbows, in whose wake the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> plummeted from a peak of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">275,000</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a mere 16,000</NUMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the start of the 20th century</TIMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Spanish Missions</ENAMEX>
The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Europeans</ENAMEX> landed on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> coast in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">16th</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">centuryÂ â€”Â Spanish explorers</ENAMEX> in search of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX>, seeking to extend their <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX> northward. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1542</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Juan RodrÃ­guez Cabrillo</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">mariner</ENAMEX> in the employ of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Viceroy of Mexico</ENAMEX>, landed at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Point Loma</ENAMEX>, at the mouth of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">harbor</ENAMEX>. He sailed on past the â€œBay of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smokesâ€</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">San</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pedro</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">present-day</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>), and on through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santa Barbara Channel</ENAMEX>. During a scuffle with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Native Americans</ENAMEX> he broke his leg and contracted <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">gangrene</ENAMEX>, which was to prove fatal, but his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crew</ENAMEX> pushed on as far as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oregon</ENAMEX>. They found few good <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">harbors</ENAMEX>, however, and no sign of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX>, and had to return empty-handed.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1579</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Englandâ</ENAMEX>€™s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis Drake</ENAMEX>, during the round-the-world trip that earned him his knighthood, took a break from harrying <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> treasure galleons and stopped for repairs at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Point Reyes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Drakeâ€™s Bay</ENAMEX>, just north of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX>). He claimed the whole coastal <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">territory</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Queen Elizabeth I</ENAMEX>, but <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX> was being kept busy with other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concerns</ENAMEX> and no attempt was made to settle the new territory.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1769</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> began to settle in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>, establishing a string of military garrisons (presidios) and religious missions. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> was built in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1769</TIMEX>, and then in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1770</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Monterey</ENAMEX> was founded as capital of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alta</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Upper</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>. The long peninsula of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baja</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lower</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> remained separate and ultimately became part of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>.
These early <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">missionaries</ENAMEX>, who were led by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Franciscan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friar</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">JunÃ­pero Serra</ENAMEX>, were all tough and courageous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>, who faced hunger and hardship when their <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> agricultural efforts failed. Their plan was to convert the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Native Americans</ENAMEX> to Christianity, teach them <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> farming methods as well as other skills and crafts, and then return the land to them before moving on to set up another mission somewhere else.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">missionaries</ENAMEX> remained active well into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th century</TIMEX>, and encouraged <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">settlers</ENAMEX> by establishing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Californiaâ€™s</ENAMEX> first <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX>, the pueblos. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1804</TIMEX> they had created a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> missions that stretched all the way from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego</ENAMEX> north to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sonoma</ENAMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> notable localities were first settled during this period. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1776</TIMEX> a presidio and a mission were built near the mouth of the beautiful bay discovered by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gaspar de PortolÃ</ENAMEX>¡ in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1769Â â</NUMEX>€”Â it was named the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">MisiÃ³n San Francisco de AsÃ­s</ENAMEX>.
The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> pueblos to be founded were the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pueblo de San Jose de Guadalupe</ENAMEX>, near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX>, and, in the south, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">El Pueblo de Nuestra SeÃ±ora la Reina de los Angeles del RÃ</ENAMEX>­o <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">de PorciÃºnculaÂ â€”Â â€œThe Town of Our Lady the Queen of the Angels by the River PorciÃºncula</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€ Founded</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1781</TIMEX> with a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhabitants</ENAMEX>, most of whom were <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Native Americans</ENAMEX>, its name was mercifully shortened over time toÂ<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL"> â€”Â you guessed itÂ â€”Â</ENAMEX> Los <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Angeles</ENAMEX>.
At this time, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> was not considered a particularly attractive proposition by its <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">overlords</ENAMEX>. Distracted by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Napoleonic</ENAMEX> wars raging in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, they finally abandoned the territory when <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> declared <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">its independence in 1821</TIMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexicans</ENAMEX>
As far as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> was concerned, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> takeover was practically bloodless. In fact, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Californiaâ</ENAMEX>€™s 26 years of rather loose <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1822â€“1848</ENAMEX>) were characterized by a series of bloodless revolutions. The governorship at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Monterey</ENAMEX> changed hands <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> times in a period of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five years</TIMEX>, not counting <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governors</ENAMEX> whom <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico City</ENAMEX> had dared to impose and whose authority was then completely ignored. There was some half-hearted fighting between northerners and southerners for control of the property and lands left by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">missionaries</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of which was meant to be returned to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Native Americans</ENAMEX> but never was.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> grew into a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">territory</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">just one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">industryÂ â€”Â cattle ranching</ENAMEX>, for the sale of cowhide and tallow. In the meantime, the old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crafts</ENAMEX> were abandoned and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> started to earn a reputation as a place of leisure.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Pioneers</ENAMEX>
The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> to come to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> from the eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> were <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX> fur <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> taking the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cape Horn</ENAMEX> route at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the 18th century</TIMEX>. They didnâ€™t stay for long, but gradually other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> and fur <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">trappers</ENAMEX> began to arrive overland through <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Utah</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nevada</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arizona</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX>, settling only in small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">numbers</ENAMEX> until the famous covered <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">wagons</ENAMEX> began their heroic treks of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1840s</TIMEX>. The hardships the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pioneers</ENAMEX> suffered in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sierra Nevada</ENAMEX> mountains, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Death Valley</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mojave Desert</ENAMEX> became the stuff of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> legend, the most tragic being the fate of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">87</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pioneers</ENAMEX> who set out from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Illinois</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1846</TIMEX>. While attempting to cross the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sierra Nevada</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Donnerâ</ENAMEX>€™s <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">wagon train</ENAMEX> became snowed in, and from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November</TIMEX> until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February</TIMEX> was stuck high in the mountains north of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lake Tahoe</ENAMEX>, at a point now known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Donner Pass</ENAMEX>. Just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> survived, and then only by resorting to cannibalism.
Just simple <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX> seeking a place in the sun to work a piece of land, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pioneers</ENAMEX> came at a time when territorial expansion was much in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">vogueÂ â€”Â the French</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Algeria</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Far East</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> was eager to get in on the act and so, during the war with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> over the annexation of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> was suddenly regarded as a useful addition to the spoils. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX> forces captured <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1847</TIMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexicans</ENAMEX> capitulated at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cahuenga</ENAMEX>. A treaty of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">annexation</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> was signed on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 February 1848</TIMEX>. Meanwhile, unknown to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> signatories, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX> had been found in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sierra Nevada</ENAMEX> foothills <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">only nine days earlier</TIMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Gold Rush</ENAMEX>
The find that caught the whole worldâ€™s imagination was made by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Wilson Marshall</ENAMEX>, a carpenter, at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">John Sutterâ</ENAMEX>€™s sawmill on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American River</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coloma</ENAMEX>, which lies midway between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sacramento</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lake Tahoe</ENAMEX>. He had found flakes of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">23-carat</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX> in the river gravel and, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the following year</TIMEX> alone, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prospectors</ENAMEX> poured in from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hawaii</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oregon</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Utah</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Peru</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chile</ENAMEX>, and proceeded to dig up <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$10 million</NUMEX> worth of the precious <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">metal</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1849</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Gold Rush</ENAMEX> really began, with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">40,000</NUMEX> fortune <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hunters</ENAMEX> from all parts of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North and South America</ENAMEX> scrabbling for the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$30 million</NUMEX> worth of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX>.
By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1852</TIMEX>, at the peak of the mining boom, there were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 100,000</NUMEX> prospectors in the region, all fiercely individualistic, working away at their personal, private stakes rather than banding together in organized <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">syndicates</ENAMEX>.
There was also another fortune to be madeÂ â€”Â this time from the service industriesÂ â€”Â and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX>, home of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturers</ENAMEX> of mining equipment, began to grow into a metropolis. All kinds of con-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hustlers</ENAMEX> flocked in to part the diggers from their gold dust. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the more enduring spin-offs of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Gold Rush</ENAMEX> was the hard-wearing work trousers sold by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Bavarian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrant</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">entrepreneur</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Levi Strauss</ENAMEX>. Originally made from tent canvas, and later from the twill-weave <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cotton</ENAMEX> known as denim, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leviâ</ENAMEX>€™s jeans are now world famous.
Lured by the promise of increased federal revenues from the newly discovered <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States Congress</ENAMEX> admitted <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> as the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">31st</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Union</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1850</TIMEX>.
Statehood
The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early years</TIMEX> of statehood were marked by a rough-and-ready kind of justice. In the absence of a well-established judiciary or organized police <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX>, law and order was enforced by vigilantes, and summary hanging was the usual sentence.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> arrived in the wake of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">great Taiping Rebellion of 1851</ENAMEX>, seeking security and prosperity in what they were told were <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Californiaâ€™s â€œGolden Mountains</ENAMEX>.â€ They suffered both exploitation by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">entrepreneurs</ENAMEX>, who used them as indentured labor, and discriminatory taxation by the state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">legislature</ENAMEX>. The worst-treated, however, were the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Native Americans</ENAMEX>, whose numbers dwindled rapidly not only as a result of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malnutrition</ENAMEX> but also because of systematic massacres in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1850s</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Californian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">militia</ENAMEX>.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1859</TIMEX> the discovery of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">silver</ENAMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Comstock Lode</ENAMEX> in western <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nevada</ENAMEX>) caused a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Silver Rush</ENAMEX> in the reverse direction, with the mining being organized almost completely from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>. As the stateâ€™s economy expanded, its major priority became a transcontinental <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">railway</ENAMEX> to connect it to the eastern markets. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Engineer Theodore Judah</ENAMEX> defied all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> by plotting a railway link between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sacramento</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East</ENAMEX>, passing right through the heart of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sierra Nevada</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Rocky</ENAMEX> mountains. He managed to sell his idea to a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">consortium</ENAMEX> that became known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central Pacificâ</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">€™s â€œBig Fourâ€Â â€”Â Mark Hopkins</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Collis Huntington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Crocker</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leland Stanford</ENAMEX>, names that continue to echo in both the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">present-day</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">railroad</ENAMEX> project transformed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Fourâ</ENAMEX>€™s personal assets of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$100,000</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1861</TIMEX> into a fortune of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$200 million</NUMEX>. The line, which linked up with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Union Pacific</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Promontory</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Utah</ENAMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1869</TIMEX>, was built under the most hazardous conditions, using poorly paid <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">laborers</ENAMEX> who sometimes worked suspended in wicker baskets over sheer cliffs to hack a tenuous cutting through the steep passes of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sierras</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Great Earthquake</ENAMEX>
The more devout <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Californians</ENAMEX> were convinced God was punishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> for its gold lust and sinfulness when an earthquake, registering <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.25</NUMEX> on the Richter Scale, struck the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5:13am</TIMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18 April 1906</TIMEX>. The initial quake wiped out <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 5,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>, but the great fire that followed destroyed most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. With the water mains shattered, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">City Fire Department</ENAMEX> could do nothing to stop the fire from spreading out of control.
The earthquake and fire together caused <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">452</NUMEX> deaths, according to official estimates, but the imposition of martial law by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mayor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schmitz</ENAMEX> (without authorization) resulted in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to 100</NUMEX> more dead in summary executions for looting or refusing to help the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">firefighters</ENAMEX>. The performance of the military was less than <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">exemplaryÂ â€”Â as Chinatown</ENAMEX> burned, it was looted by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Guardsmen</ENAMEX> sent to protect it.
Reform, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Progress</ENAMEX>, and Oil
The <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">San Francisco earthquake</ENAMEX> helped to focus the nationâ€™s attention on the graft and corruption that ran right through the heart of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> society. The federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">prosecution</ENAMEX> succeeded in jailing only a handful of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principals</ENAMEX> involved, but the publicity was enough to make the concept of â€œreformâ€ a popular <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>.
The reform movement, intent on breaking the political power of the big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporations</ENAMEX>, attacked corrupt practices in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>, public finances, and banking, but did nothing to oppose the businessmenâ€™s traditional resistance to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unions</ENAMEX> and more liberal labor laws. There was also a campaign of official discrimination against <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX>, excluding them from owning land and preventing further immigration.
All kinds of produce grew large and lush in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Californiaâ</ENAMEX>€™s fertile, irrigated soil, but the most financially profitable thing to come out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Californian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">earth</ENAMEX> was oil. Drilling had begun in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1860s</TIMEX> but didnâ€™t take off until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1892</TIMEX>. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1920s</TIMEX>, the derricks of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Standard</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Union</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shell</ENAMEX> oil <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> had sprouted all over the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> basin. In that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one decade</TIMEX>, the stateâ€™s oil revenues were <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2.5 billion</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$500 million</NUMEX> more than all the gold the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sierras</ENAMEX> yielded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a century</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sunny</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX>-rich <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> was therefore the perfect place for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> to emerge as an everyday household accessory. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">From 1920 to 1930</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">L.A.</ENAMEX>â€™s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> more than doubled, and the number of private <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> increased fivefold. Noting the central position of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">â€œpursuit of happinessâ€ in Americaâ€™s Declaration of Independence</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los Angeles Times</ENAMEX> asked in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1926</TIMEX>: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â</NUMEX>€œHow can one pursue happiness by any swifter and surer means than by the use of the automobile?â€
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX>
If you didnâ€™t feel like pursuing happiness in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>, you could sit in the dark and dream about it in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cinema</ENAMEX> instead. The booming popularity of this new entertainment form meant that the film production <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>, based originally in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East</ENAMEX>, had to find a place where they could shoot outdoors for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">52 weeks a year</TIMEX>. They finally settled in a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">suburb</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX>, where there was guaranteed sunshine <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all the year</TIMEX> round plusÂ â€”Â within easy reach of the new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">studiosÂ â€”Â deserts</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">mountains</ENAMEX> as well as beaches, rivers, forests, and islands which could double for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wild West</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holy Land</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MediterraneanÂ â€”Â wherever</ENAMEX>. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX> soon became a mecca for dreamers. Somewhat dubious â€œtalent schoolsâ€ sprang up, catering to small-town <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> who hoped to emulate film <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stars</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Pickford</ENAMEX>. If they didnâ€™t make it as actresses, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œschoolsâ€</ENAMEX> turned them into call <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">producers</ENAMEX>, and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1922</TIMEX> the lurid rape trial of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">comic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fatty Arbuckle</ENAMEX> highlighted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hollywoodâ</ENAMEX>€™s decadent lifestyle of fast <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX>, bootleg whisky, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>. The immediate reaction was the imposition of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hays Office</ENAMEX> code of morals, which decreed that in all <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX> films sin must be punishedÂ â€”Â it could be shown in detail, but it must always be punished.
The industry cashed in on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the boom years of the 1920s</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood Boulevard</ENAMEX> introduced lavishly exotic <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Egyptian</ENAMEX>-style movie <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palaces</ENAMEX>, and film <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stars</ENAMEX> built <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> to match in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beverly Hills</ENAMEX>, the most famous being the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Pickfair</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansion</ENAMEX>, a hunting lodge which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Douglas Fairbanks</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Pickford</ENAMEX> turned into a honeymoon estate. However, in spite of the glamour, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hollywoodâ€™s</ENAMEX> rather seedy image persisted. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boarding</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> sometimes advertised â€œRooms for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rentÂ â€”Â no dogs</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actors</ENAMEX> allowed.â€
<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Depression</ENAMEX> and Boom
The <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Great Depression</ENAMEX> hit <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> hard. Income from agriculture dropped by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 percent</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1929 and 1932</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one-fifth</NUMEX> of the stateâ€™s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> was on public relief. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> managed to weather the downturn better than the rest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, however, and became a magnet for dispossessed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">refugees</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dustbowl</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Midwest</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€œOkies</ENAMEX>,â€ as they were known, packed their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> and belongings into rickety <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trucks</ENAMEX> to make the epic voyage west to find work in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">farms</ENAMEX> and orchards of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>. Their tale of hardship, pride, bitterness, and exploitation is graphically recorded in the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Pulitzer Prizeâ€“winning novel The Grapes of Wrath</ENAMEX>, by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Steinbeck</ENAMEX>.
Then came <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX>, bringing with it an enormous boom for the stateâ€™s beleaguered economy, with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> federal government spending <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$35 billion</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>. Overnight, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planes</ENAMEX> became the stateâ€™s most important products. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Manufacturers</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Douglas</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lockheed</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northrop</ENAMEX> were all located in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> area.
In the post-war period <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> continued to prosper. Agriculture grew up into agribusiness; the film industry expanded into the new field of television; the aircraft industry was boosted by the space program; and semiconductor technology paved the way for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Silicon Valley</ENAMEX>.

Beatniks, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hippies</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Modern Times</ENAMEX>
True to the tradition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Californiaâ</ENAMEX>€™s indulgence of utopian dreams, the Beat generation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1950s</TIMEX> made its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Franciscoâ€™s North Beach</ENAMEX> district. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Writers</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Kerouac</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allen Ginsberg</ENAMEX>, as well as the poets that hung <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">round Lawrence Ferlinghettiâ€™s City Lights Bookstore</ENAMEX>, advocated a free and unstructured style of writing, exemplified by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Kerouacâ</ENAMEX>€™s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cult</ENAMEX> novel On the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Road</ENAMEX>.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ten years</TIMEX> on, the term â€œhippiesâ€ was coined for the flower <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> who gathered around the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Haight-Ashbury</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">district</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX>. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhabitants</ENAMEX> of what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joan Didion</ENAMEX> was to call â€œAmericaâ€™s first teenage <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">slumâ</ENAMEX>€ dispensed a vision of love, peace, and light, heavily laced with marijuana and more dangerous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSD</ENAMEX>. The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixties</TIMEX> also produced a distinctive brand of rock music, with bands such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grateful Dead</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jefferson Airplane</ENAMEX>, and the legendary voice of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Janis Joplin</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> was also in the forefront of student radicalism, beginning with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Free Speech Movement at Berkeley</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1964</TIMEX>, and ending with the violent clashes at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">San Francisco State University</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1968 and the 1969</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Berkeley</ENAMEX> demonstration in favor of a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">â€œPeopleâ€™s Park</ENAMEX>,â€ when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">protesters</ENAMEX> were sprayed with tear <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX>.
Black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">radicalism</ENAMEX> accelerated after the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Watts</ENAMEX> riots in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1965</TIMEX> and reached its peak with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Black Panthers</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oakland</ENAMEX>, a paramilitary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> led by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Huey Newton</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eldridge Cleaver</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bobby Seale</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Watts</ENAMEX> riots were sinisterly echoed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> riots of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX>, when the same area of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South-Central L.A.</ENAMEX> was ravaged by violence in response to the acquittal of white police <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> who were captured on videotape beating a black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">resident</ENAMEX>.
Americaâ€™s continuous social revolution has always had a prominent place in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> life. Pressures for some kind of change have been alternately encouraged and resisted as the stateâ€™s volatile political establishment has swung back and forth between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conservatives</ENAMEX> and progressives. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald Reagan</ENAMEX>, a staunch <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> and former <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actor</ENAMEX>, served as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1966 and 1974</TIMEX> and as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">from 1980 to 1988</TIMEX>. He was succeeded as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerry Brown</ENAMEX>, known to many as <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">â€œGovernor Moonbeam</ENAMEX>.â€ A left-wing <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrat</ENAMEX> who espoused <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zen Buddhism</ENAMEX> and the legalization of marijuana, he also imposed environmental protection measures and energy resources long before others began to see the wisdom of such policies. In his current incarnation, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mayor</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oakland</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>.
Recent earthquakesÂ â€”Â one in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX> and another that hit <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1994Â â</NUMEX>€”Â have served as reminders that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Californians</ENAMEX> continue to live in the shadow of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">The Big OneÂ â€”Â the</ENAMEX> major earthquake that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> predict will strike in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next 30 years</TIMEX>. It says a lot for the attractions of life in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">CaliforniaÂ â€”Â</ENAMEX> and the optimism of those who continue to enjoy itÂ â€”Â that despite this dire prediction, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> still seek their future in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golden Stateâ€™s</ENAMEX> promised land.
