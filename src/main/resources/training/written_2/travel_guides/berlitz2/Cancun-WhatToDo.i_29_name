Where to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shop</ENAMEX>
Traveling around the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yucat√°n</ENAMEX> peninsula will present you with a wealth of shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">opportunities¬†‚Äî¬†many</ENAMEX> are only a short stroll away from the beaches. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canc√∫n</ENAMEX> has a number of modern, air-conditioned shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">malls</ENAMEX>, with internationally recognized brand names, where you can shop in comfort from <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning to night</TIMEX>, though of course prices are higher here than inland.
For strolling and browsing in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> sunshine or the cooler air <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">of the evening</TIMEX>, there are shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">San Miguel de Cozumel</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isla Mujeres</ENAMEX>, and in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Calle 5</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Playa del Carmen</ENAMEX>. These <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> have <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> selling locally produced crafts and imported goods, pretty <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boutiques</ENAMEX>, and jewelry <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX>.
Visit the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hi Kuic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">craft</ENAMEX> market in downtown <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canc√∫n</ENAMEX>, and better still the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mercado Municipal</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">M√©rida</ENAMEX>, to experience the genuine, colorful atmosphere of a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> market. Examples of every locally produced <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">craft</ENAMEX> can be found in abundance here, and you‚Äôll <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop</ENAMEX> cheaper than in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX>, especially if you practice your bartering skills beforehand.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Don‚Äôt</ENAMEX> let the range of goods blind you to low quality or fakes. Always examine the item you want very carefully and shop around to get a feel of the prices before you buy. Most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> in the main tourist areas will stay open until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10pm</TIMEX>. Prices will often be quoted, and you will be able to pay, in <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">US dollars</NUMEX>.
What to Buy
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Handicrafts</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mayan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have always made everything they needed, and their handicrafts, though often practical, make beautiful souvenirs. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Basketware</ENAMEX> made from sisal and other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> species found in the area is typically used to carry a range of goods; woven mats can also be found. Hammocks come in a bewildering range of quality, colors, and sizes; you‚Äôll have your choice of a sencillo (single) or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to share with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>, such as a doble¬†(double) or matrimonial (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>-sized).
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weaving</ENAMEX> has also been a very important skill for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mayans</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fabric</ENAMEX> produced on personal looms in traditional patterns and colors is used in a variety of different products. Sarapes, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cotton</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wool</ENAMEX> blankets, and rugs are popular, but you will also find the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">material</ENAMEX> made into jackets and hats.
Mayan themes. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maya</ENAMEX> have a special place in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">imagination¬†‚Äî¬†perhaps</ENAMEX> only surpassed by the ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Egyptians¬</ENAMEX>†‚Äî¬†and their traditional motifs and copies of their ceremonial artifacts make popular souvenirs. <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Carvings of the gods</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chaac Mool</ENAMEX> in particular, along with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">revered creatures</ENAMEX> such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">jaguar</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">feathered serpent</ENAMEX>, are produced in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stone</ENAMEX>, onyx, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">silver</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wood</ENAMEX>, and papier-m√¢ch√©, in various sizes from lucky talisman for your purse to sculpture for your garden.
Ceremonial masks are also very beautiful and can be found in a range of qualities and sizes. Made from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">papier-m√¢ch√</NUMEX>© that is smoothed and brightly painted, they make beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wall decorations</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pottery</ENAMEX> and glassware. Terracotta pots have been the basic cooking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">utensil</ENAMEX> for generations of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mayan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">You‚Äôll</ENAMEX> find these in various sizes and with different decoration. Blown glassware is also exquisite; bowls, jugs and vases, and glasses can be bought throughout the region.
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Silver</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> is still one of the largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">producers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">silver</ENAMEX> in the world, despite the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> conquistadors having looted tons of it during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">their years</TIMEX> of conquest. There is an amazing range of jewelry available, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX>, earrings, and finger and toe rings, and prices are extremely competitive. Larger pieces such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX>-sets and goblets can be found in the bigger <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX>, as can silver pill-boxes, purses, or small <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">‚Äúsombreros</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚Äù Always</ENAMEX> make sure that your purchase bears a stamp of the word <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> and of the numbers 925 (the standard quality of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">silver</ENAMEX> found here) or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">960</NUMEX> (purer but slightly softer). This ensures that you are buying genuine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">silver</ENAMEX> and not a cheap <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alloy</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tequila</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tequila</ENAMEX> is the national drink of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>, made from the distilled <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">juice</ENAMEX> of the agave <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> agave tequila is the best quality), and it can be bought under numerous trade names. It is produced only in a very small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>, around the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of Tequila near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Guadalajara</ENAMEX>, and is in reality a refined version of the agave drink <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mezcal</ENAMEX>. You can also take home a bottle of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yucatecan</ENAMEX> liquor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Xtebentun</ENAMEX>, with its flavor of anise, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">honey</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>.
Clothing. You are sure to find something that fits your personal taste in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> attire in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yucat√°n.</ENAMEX> Designer labels from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> are abundant in the tourist-<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">zone malls</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canc√∫n.</ENAMEX> Smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> throughout the region are filled with attractive beachwear, T-shirts, hats, footwear, and cool, comfortable cotton dresses, skirts, and sarongs that are ideal for the warm climate here.
Locally produced cottons and woven garments are sold in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">craft</ENAMEX>-markets and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX>. The colorful patterns have been handed down through the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX>. In the countryside, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mayan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> still wear the traditional huipile, a loose cotton slip with embroidered detail; the everyday version has stitching around the neckline and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hem</ENAMEX>, the ceremonial version several layers of embroidery and lace. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">M√©rida</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> wear the guayabera, a short-sleeved <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">linen</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cotton</ENAMEX> shirt with finely pleated front detail, worn untucked. These tend to be much cooler than fitted shirts. Huaraches are hand-fashioned leather sandals with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sisal thongs</ENAMEX>. You can top off your whole traditional ensemble with a hat: local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> wear good quality panama hats (many imported from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guatemala</ENAMEX>). You can also buy sombreros, though these are actually traditional in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">regions of Mexico</ENAMEX> other than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yucat√°n.</ENAMEX>
Duty-Free <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shopping</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cozumel</ENAMEX> is a major cruise destination and as such offers goods like fragrances and gemstones at duty-free prices. You can buy loose <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stones</ENAMEX> or finished pieces at a number of large, air-conditioned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avenida Melgar</ENAMEX>, with prices said to be <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as much as 40%</NUMEX> lower than <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> retail. If you intend to make a major purchase of this type while visiting the region, it would be wise to research the prices and quality of goods at home, before you travel, so that you can be sure you are getting a good deal.
Sports
Diving
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Canc√∫n</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cozumel</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maya Riviera</ENAMEX> offer some of the most pristine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX> for diving and a wealth of natural reefs and artificial dive sites to explore. They are still considered some of the best sites in the world, despite the explosion in the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">divers</ENAMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last two decades</TIMEX>. The lack of soil and rivers on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yucatecan</ENAMEX> mainland mean that there is no silt in the sea to reduce underwater visibility, and there is little heavy industry in the area to pollute the ocean, leaving the marine life relatively healthy.
The island of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cozumel</ENAMEX> is still regarded as the jewel among diving areas. There are <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">30 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20 miles</NUMEX>) of reef, at many different depths, off the western <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">coast</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Divers</ENAMEX> have a chance to see <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">turtles</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sharks</ENAMEX>, and barracuda in their natural environment; the warm waters make for exciting and comfortable diving throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX>. Plus, there are opportunities for both certified <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">divers</ENAMEX> and those who would like to earn their certification.
Canc√∫n is a great beginner‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX>; it has many shallow dive sites suitable for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">novice</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Experts</ENAMEX> can be well rewarded too¬†‚Äî¬†just a short distance from your <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX> are challenging dive <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> and some of the richest marine life anywhere on earth.
Remember to bring your dive certificate, as you will only be allowed to rent equipment and dive if you can prove your competence.
If you want to learn to dive in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canc√∫n</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cozumel</ENAMEX>, there is an excellent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> of dive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> offering training to professional levels. All <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> are affiliated with one of the major certifying bodies, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NAUI</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Association of Underwater Instructors</ENAMEX>) or PADI (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Professional Association of Diving Instructors</ENAMEX>), the latter being the most common. The basic qualification, the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Open Water</ENAMEX> certificate, takes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five days</TIMEX> to complete. Upon completion you can dive with an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">instructor</ENAMEX> to a depth of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> ft), which opens to you many <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> in the region. Diving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> also offer an introductory session known as the ‚ÄúDiscover <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scuba Program</ENAMEX>,‚Äù which includes a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning or afternoon</TIMEX> of theory and swimming-pool work to give you the chance to practice the basic techniques. Many large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> offer this lesson as a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> for their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guests</ENAMEX>.
The following are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> reputable local dive <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diving Adventures</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calle</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX> Sur <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#22</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cozumel</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tel</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">87/2-3009</TIMEX>; <www.divingadventures.net>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scuba Canc√∫n</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">km</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5 Paseo Kukulk√°n</ENAMEX>, lagoon side, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canc√∫n</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tel</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">98/83-1011</TIMEX>; fax <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">98/84</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2336</NUMEX>.
It is also possible to dive and swim in cenotes, sinkholes found in the sub-surface limestone layer of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yucat√°n</ENAMEX> peninsula, caused by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> of erosion. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maya</ENAMEX> considered them to be holy <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">places</ENAMEX> because they were the only source of fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> other than what fell from the sky; for this reason, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mayan</ENAMEX> artifacts have been found in many cenotes. The holes provide an environment for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">turtles</ENAMEX>, eels, and a variety of tropical <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>. Swimming in the cool, fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> of the cenotes (a nice change from the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt water</ENAMEX> of the sea) is great fun. Cenote diving is only for the experienced. Always go through a reputable dive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> listed above will offer further advice.
Snorkeling
Well <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over half</NUMEX> of all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> to the region will snorkel while on vacation. The superb clarity and warmth of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, the abundant sea life even in the shallows, and the proximity of all of this to the resorts are what make snorkeling here appealing. You can snorkel at just about every beach on the west coast of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cozumel</ENAMEX>, on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Isla Mujeres</ENAMEX>, and along the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Maya Riviera</ENAMEX>.
The many national <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX> offer more natural environments, though the sea may still be crowded with fellow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">snorkelers</ENAMEX> during the high <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Garraf√≥n/Punta Sur Park on Mujeres</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Chankanaab National Park</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cozumel</ENAMEX> both rent snorkeling equipment.
The numerous coves (narrow bays with rocky walls found all along the coastline), are a perfect environment for small, brightly colored tropical <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xcaret</ENAMEX> is probably the most famous site, but you can enjoy snorkeling at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Xel-Ha and Tr√©s Rios</ENAMEX> as well.
Not yet qualified to dive? Both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNUBA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BOB</ENAMEX> are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-and-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> water experiences. With both you are underwater, but with a constant supply of air from tubes at the surface. <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">BOB, the Breathing Observation Bubble</ENAMEX>, is a kind of underwater scooter with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen helmet</ENAMEX>. Contact <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hotel Canc√∫n Marina Club</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">km 5.5</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tel</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">98/83-4440</ENAMEX>), for details. With <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNUBA</ENAMEX> you wear a helmet, but you walk on the ocean floor. Contact <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AquaWorld</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canc√</ENAMEX>∫n for further details.
Other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Activities</ENAMEX>
Swim with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dolphins</ENAMEX>. These programs exist at various locations around the region, so you will have the opportunity no matter which of the big resorts you choose. Some venues have a range of different programs, from simply free-swimming with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dolphins</ENAMEX>, to performing exercises with them, to helping a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trainer</ENAMEX> for a day. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dolphin Discovery</ENAMEX> operates programs at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Isla Mujeres, Cozumel</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Aventuras</ENAMEX>; <www.dolphindiscovery.com>.

Viewing marine life without getting wet. If getting into the water isn‚Äôt for you, then take a glass-bottom boat ride; trips navigate the mangrove swamps or venture out to the ocean reefs. It is also possible to travel under the surface of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> in a submersible <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">craft</ENAMEX>. Nautibus, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sub See Explorer</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Atlantis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">XII</ENAMEX> all submerge to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">150 ft</ENAMEX>) to explore the reef eco-system. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nautibus</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">four sailings</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a day</TIMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">El Embarcadero</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">km 4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Canc√∫n Hotel Zone</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tel</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">98/83-3732</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">AquaWorld</ENAMEX> boasts various <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">craft¬†as well¬†‚Äî¬†they</ENAMEX> can be found at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Kukulk√°n Boulevard</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">km 15.2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hotel Zone</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tel</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">98/85-2288</TIMEX>; fax <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">98/85-2299</TIMEX>; <www.aquaworld.com.mx>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Atlantis Submarine</ENAMEX>: Chankanaab <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">km 4</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Casa del Mar Hotel</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cozumel</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tel</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">987/2-5671</ENAMEX> or (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">888</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">REAL-SUB</ENAMEX> (toll-free in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX>); <www.goatlantis.com>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Watersports</ENAMEX>. Most of the major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX> will have <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water ‚Äútoys‚Äù</ENAMEX> for rent; you can jet-ski or water-<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bike</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX> or along the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mangrove</ENAMEX> swamps in the lagoon at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canc√∫n.</ENAMEX> Note: Do obey the speed limits, in place to protect the delicate environment which is damaged by waves from speeding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">jet</ENAMEX>-skis. And what better way to view the beautiful landscape, particularly the long beach and lagoon at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canc√∫n</ENAMEX>, than from a parasail some <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">33 m</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">100 ft</ENAMEX>) up in the air? You‚Äôll be able to fully appreciate the color of the sand and the ocean from on high.
Sport fishing. The warm waters of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX> are teeming with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>, and sport fishing is becoming increasingly popular. Bonito, amberjack, barracuda, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shark</ENAMEX> can be caught in these waters <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all year</TIMEX>; huge sailfish, tuna, and several species of marlin are most common <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between March and June</TIMEX>; and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the winter months</TIMEX> shoals of grouper and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">jewfish</ENAMEX> abound. Large, powerful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> can be organized at just about every <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> along the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">coast¬†‚Äî¬†they</ENAMEX> are particularly plentiful in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cozumel</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Playa del Carmen</ENAMEX>. The local guides are especially experienced and helpful.
Prices vary, but a full day‚Äôs rental of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crew</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX>) is <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between $400‚Äì500</NUMEX>. Half-day rentals are also available. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ocean Tours</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Miguel</ENAMEX> is just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> boat-charter <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tel</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">987/2-1379</TIMEX>; fax <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">987/2-3459</TIMEX>; e-mail: <ocean@cozumel.czm.com.mx>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> also hosts a number of fishing tournaments.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">Golf</ENAMEX>. Canc√∫n is the site for a growing number of golf <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX>, and the climate of the area is ideal for a round or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pok-Ta-Pok</ENAMEX> was the first course, and some still say the best. However, since it opened, several large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> have built <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX> as part of their guest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX>: The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meli√° Canc√∫n</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">km 15</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Hilton Canc√∫n</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">km 17</TIMEX>; and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Westin Regina</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">km 19.5</TIMEX>. There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX> along the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Maya Riviera</ENAMEX>, principally at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Aventuras</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Playacar</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX> are located in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Playa del Carmen</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Horseback</ENAMEX> riding. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> introduced <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX> to the region; they were perfect for transport through the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">‚Äúlow</ENAMEX> jungle.‚Äù <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> you can explore the area on horseback, enjoying organized and guided <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">trails</ENAMEX> at many <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX>, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xcaret</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tr√©s Rios</ENAMEX>. All across the region you will see <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ranches</ENAMEX> advertising their services¬†‚Äî¬†often you will see a horse tied in the shade at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ranch</ENAMEX> entrance to indicate that riding is offered.
Entertainment
Once the sun goes down, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canc√</ENAMEX>∫n gears up. There‚Äôs no shortage of places to go or things to do, and no need to take a long novel to fill those quiet moments¬†‚Äî¬†there just won‚Äôt be any. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> don‚Äôt take to their beds until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">they‚</TIMEX>Äôve seen the sun come up. If you choose to stay in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mujeres</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cozumel</ENAMEX>, things will be a bit more laid back. The diving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fraternity</ENAMEX> tends to enjoy low-key, less glamorous entertainment and relatively early <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">nights</TIMEX> before they head under the waves early <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the following day</TIMEX>.
Before you head straight into the resort atmosphere of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canc√∫n</ENAMEX>, check out what‚Äôs happening in your <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX>. Many have ‚ÄúLas <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vegas</ENAMEX> style‚Äù floor shows, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> evenings with traditional folk music and dances, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clubs</ENAMEX> where you can take to the dance floor yourself.
Canc√∫n is developing so quickly that the latest hot-spots change constantly. Ask your concierge where the place to be is, or just follow the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowds</ENAMEX> along the strip. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paseo Kukulk√</ENAMEX>°n in downtown <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canc√∫n</ENAMEX> has a collection of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bars</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clubs</ENAMEX>. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekends</TIMEX> you can join the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locals</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parque de Palapas</ENAMEX>, where the strains of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rock</ENAMEX>, salsa, and folk music can blend together into a bewildering cacophony. But this doesn‚Äôt prevent everyone from having great fun¬†‚Äî¬†and the atmosphere is definitely infectious.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cozumel</ENAMEX> has a number of music <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX> along <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Avenida Melgar</ENAMEX> and in the downtown <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX>. All the large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> have an entertainment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">program</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">nightclub</ENAMEX> on site.

The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M√</ENAMEX>©rida seems to be in the throes of a constant fiesta, hosting live cultural shows at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> around the downtown area.
