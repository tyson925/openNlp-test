Where to Go
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve</ENAMEX> stretches from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic Ocean</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>, but it‚Äôs actually a small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX>. Faro, the capital, is just <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">30 miles</NUMEX>) from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> border, and it is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only 112 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">70 miles</NUMEX>) west of what was known in medieval times as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">o fim</ENAMEX> do mundo (the end of the world) at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sagres</ENAMEX>. Along <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this 160-km</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100-mile</NUMEX>) coastal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">strip</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">holiday</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> of all stripes have sprung up, so wherever you are based, you‚Äôll never be far from a good beach, a reasonably sized <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, and nightlife.
The following pages cover the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve</ENAMEX> traveling west to east, though you could certainly do the reverse or begin in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>, near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Faro</ENAMEX> (or anywhere you elect to stay) and embark on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX> trips both east and west from there. For those with additional time and interest in seeing more of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX>, a brief section on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lisbon</ENAMEX> and its seductive environs is included. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lisbon</ENAMEX> is about <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">four hours</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> (and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">40 minutes</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX>) from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Faro</ENAMEX>; it should be conceived as an add-on to your visit to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve</ENAMEX> rather than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a day</TIMEX> trip. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> visit the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve</ENAMEX> by flying into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lisbon</ENAMEX> and driving to the southern coast. If you are flying directly to the international <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Faro</ENAMEX> and wish to spend <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few days</TIMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lisbon</ENAMEX> area, it would make sense to see about a return flight from there.
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">World‚Äôs End: Sagres and Cabo de S√£o</ENAMEX> Vicente
If you begin your journey at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sagres</ENAMEX>, you may be in for a shock. The hardscrabble <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> and area around it scarcely look the part of a fabled beach <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> with a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX> feel. Rather, it is remote, rugged and desert-like, with only a relative smattering (compared to the rest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve</ENAMEX>) of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> aimed at <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX>. It is like the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Algarve‚Äôs outpost</ENAMEX>, which is precisely why it has so many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">admirers</ENAMEX>.
Sagres‚Äôs connections to the sea, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Portugal‚</ENAMEX>Äôs maritime exploits, are strong. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prince Henry the Navigator</ENAMEX> established his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navigation School</ENAMEX> here (though some protest that it was farther east, near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lagos</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> has a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">picturesque</ENAMEX> working harbor, where small, brightly painted fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats bob</ENAMEX>, and larger <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX> haul in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> catches of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lobster</ENAMEX>, eel, and mackerel. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> are clustered around the harbor, with impressive views. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inland</ENAMEX>, a cute little square, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pra√ßa Rep√∫blica</ENAMEX>, is ringed by informal (and, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX>, hopping) nightspots.
The best beaches near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sagres</ENAMEX> are sheltered and not overcrowded. Mareta, down below the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> pousada, is the most popular. Martinhal, just east of the harbor, is a wide, curved beach with a first-class <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">watersports center</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beliche</ENAMEX> (also spelled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Belixe</ENAMEX>) is a sandy expanse protected by the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cape</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">St.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vincent</ENAMEX>. Tonel, just before <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beliche</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Telheiro</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 9 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6 miles</NUMEX>) up the west coast from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sagres</ENAMEX>, are also well-regarded beach spots.
Beyond the village of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sagres</ENAMEX>, a great, rocky peninsula hangs above a brooding ocean. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">You‚Äôll</ENAMEX> understand why, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the days</TIMEX> before the great <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">explorers</ENAMEX> set out from here seeking to discover the great beyond, it was known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">End of the World</ENAMEX>. Those wishing to put a positive spin on things called it <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Sacrum Saturni¬†‚Äî¬†Holy Promontory¬†‚Äî¬†and</ENAMEX> believed that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gods</ENAMEX> slept here.
Since time immemorial this forlorn place has stirred the imagination. It stirred <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sailors</ENAMEX>, who are said to have set up <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camp</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fortaleza de Sagres</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fortress</ENAMEX>) that sits on the promontory. Unfortunately, not much of the original has survived. Most of it is a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">fort</ENAMEX> that was insensitively restored. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX>, the walls of this nationally important monument were resurfaced with gray concrete, destroying the external <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>. The fortress‚Äôs principal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>, which may have been Henry‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX>, has been demolished. What you‚Äôll find inside is a small <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">chapel</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nossa Senhora da Gra√ßa</ENAMEX>, and what looks to be a huge stone sun dial, known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosa dos Ventos</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rose Compass</ENAMEX>). Whether, in fact, it was a wind compass useful in the great voyages is unknown. A modern <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">shell</ENAMEX> on the fort‚Äôs grounds <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> an exhibition area.
A <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">couple of km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">one mile</NUMEX>) west of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sagres</ENAMEX> are the more authentic remains of another fortress, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fortaleza do Beliche</ENAMEX>. This small, attractive <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> houses a white, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">domed chapel</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Catarina</ENAMEX>) and is home to a smart traditional-style restaurant and a small annex to the pousada in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sagres</ENAMEX>. Both the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">fort and chapel</ENAMEX>, however, threaten to collapse because the surrounding cliffs are eroding at a frightening rate. Efforts to shore up the cliffs and save the historic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">site</ENAMEX> have recently been undertaken.
The windswept cliffs of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cabo de S√£o Vicente</ENAMEX>, the most southwesterly point in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, were once surely even more bleak than they are <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, when supertankers and small yachts heave into view around the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">cape</ENAMEX>. But even on the calmest of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX> thunders below and the wind whips around the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">cape</ENAMEX>. At the tip of the point, the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">lighthouse</ENAMEX>, built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1904</TIMEX> on the site of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">convent chapel</ENAMEX>, has a beam visible <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">up to 96 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">60 miles</NUMEX>) away. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Visitors</ENAMEX> can climb the stairs to a hot, enclosed lookout.
The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> settlement of any size outside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sagres</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vila do Bispo</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">7 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4 miles</NUMEX>) to the north. Take a break in the peaceful town‚Äôs pleasant, flower-filled garden <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> and pay a visit to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 18th-century</TIMEX> parish <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>. The walls are covered with azulejos and its ceiling decorated with frescoes.
About halfway between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sagres</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lagos</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salema</ENAMEX> is regarded as an up-and-coming <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> of this stretch, with a lively sprinkling of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bars</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, a pleasant beach with fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX>, and a market.
Burgau, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3.2 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 miles</NUMEX>) east, is small and sleepy. Fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> pulled up onto the end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> leading down to the beach jostle with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX>. The beach here is less attractive than those at neighboring <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Luz</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salema</ENAMEX>, but the small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> retains its easygoing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Luz</ENAMEX> is a pleasant seaside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>. All that remains of old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Luz</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> and, opposite, the fortress, which has been attractively renovated and converted into a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX>. There is a good beach with watersports <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> and large, flat rocks where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vacationers</ENAMEX> bask in the sun like lizards.
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Lagos</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lagos</ENAMEX>, the principal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> of the western <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Algarve</ENAMEX>, is the rare beach <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> that offers something for everyone. By night <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lagos</ENAMEX> is lively, with outdoor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX> terraces and bars attracting a hipper <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX> than most <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX> on the coast, and by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX> it combines a rich historical past with a busy present. Attractive beaches are just on the outskirts of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, so it is not a classic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> in the mold of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Praia da Rocha</ENAMEX>.
Your first view of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lagos</ENAMEX> will probably be from the long, riverside <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Avenida</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dos</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Descobrimentos</ENAMEX>, which divides the old walled <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> from the port. At the other end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">avenue</ENAMEX>, the well-restored fortress, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Forte da Ponte da Bandeira</ENAMEX>, once guarded the entrance to the harbor in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th century</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cross</ENAMEX> the river to see busy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fishermen</ENAMEX>, handsome <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> anchored in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">marina</ENAMEX>, and the fine view of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> above the walls. Many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> rising towards the top of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> are narrow, cobbled, and more accustomed to donkeys than rental <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX>. Though <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lagos</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> still retains a good part of its original walls¬†‚Äî¬†most of them from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16th century</TIMEX>, but part-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> in places¬†‚Äî¬†they have been rebuilt and expanded over the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX>. Climb the ramparts for fine views over the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX> and out to sea.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lagos</ENAMEX> was an important trading <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX> under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moors</ENAMEX>, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> enjoyed its heyday after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reconquest</ENAMEX>. It was proclaimed the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">governor‚Äôs palace</ENAMEX> became the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prince</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry</ENAMEX>. A formal statue of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry</ENAMEX>, seated with sextant in hand, has been erected on a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plaza</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pra√ßa Dom Henrique</ENAMEX>) next to the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">avenue</ENAMEX>. Arguments persist over the exact whereabouts of the prince‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">School of Navigation</ENAMEX>, but it seems almost certain that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lagos</ENAMEX> was the principal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shipyard</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX> serving his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> of explorers.
Those were glory <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, but some of what was glorious in those heady times <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> seems reprehensible. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Explorations</ENAMEX> along the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">west coast of Africa</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-15th century</TIMEX> established a flourishing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">slave</ENAMEX> trade, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lagos</ENAMEX> was a key <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">player</ENAMEX> in human commerce. Just behind the statue of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry</ENAMEX>, on the corner of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rua da Senhora da Gra√ßa</ENAMEX>, you can still see the small arcade where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Portugal‚Äôs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">first slave</ENAMEX> auctions took place. A small plaque <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> simply <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mercado de Escravos</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slave Market</ENAMEX>). Most other historic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> around the square succumbed to the devastating earthquake of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1755</TIMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>). The majority of the city‚Äôs attractive <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> thus date from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 18th and 19th centuries</TIMEX>.
On <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rua General</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alberta da Silveira</ENAMEX>, the tiny chapel <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Igreja de Santo Ant√≥nio</ENAMEX>, an exuberant gilt Baroque work and one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve‚</ENAMEX>Äôs finest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX>, was rebuilt soon after the earthquake. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>, a national monument dedicated to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">St.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anthony</ENAMEX>, has a handsome display of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th-century</TIMEX> blue-and-white glazed tiles and a brightly painted wood ceiling. In the floor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">you‚Äôll</ENAMEX> find the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tomb</ENAMEX> of an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Irish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colonel</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hugh Beatty</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldier</ENAMEX> of fortune who commanded the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lagos</ENAMEX> regiment of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 18th century</TIMEX>, and who must have been held in very high esteem to have been awarded such a prestigious final resting place.
The entrance to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> is actually through the curious and eclectic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> next door, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Museu Regional de Lagos</ENAMEX>. Rooms display sacred art, archaeological remains, the original charter of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lagos</ENAMEX>, holy <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">vestments</ENAMEX>, and a bizarre collection of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">creatures</ENAMEX>, like a science experiment gone bad: an <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX>-legged goat <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX> preserved in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">formaldehyde</ENAMEX>, a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-eyed <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sheep</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> faces.
The main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lagos</ENAMEX> is the charming, cobbled <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rua 25 de Abril</ENAMEX>, packed with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX>, and antiques and ceramics <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>. The side <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> hold some good art (and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">craft</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">galleries</ENAMEX> and plenty of rewards for exploration. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> at the end of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Abril</ENAMEX> holds a curious statue, which some liken to an extraterrestrial, of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy-king</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sebasti√£o</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1568</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sebastian</ENAMEX> became <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 14</TIMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A decade later</TIMEX> he embarked on a disastrous voyage to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Morocco</ENAMEX> to fight the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moors</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">At least 7,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> died, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX> included (though many refused to believe he had perished, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elvis</ENAMEX>-like sightings were common).
The beaches near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lagos</ENAMEX> range from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meia Praia</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1.6 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 mile</NUMEX>) to the east, a long (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4 km/21/2 mile</NUMEX>) flat stretch, to pocket-sized coves <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">just</NUMEX> west of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. Weird and wonderful rock formations, and steep cliffs that glow orange at sunset, have made them some of the most photographed in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Praia de Dona Ana</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Praia do Camilo</ENAMEX>, both small, pretty and crowded (street signs indicate the way to each).
At the southern tip, just before it turns west to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sagres</ENAMEX>, are the coast‚Äôs most spectacular sights. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ponta da Piedade</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Point of Piety</ENAMEX>) is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> of all stack and cliff formations along the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve</ENAMEX>, a stunning terracotta <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridges</ENAMEX>, terraces, and grottoes. There is no beach here, but there are great views from above, and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">spring</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">autumn</TIMEX>) boat trips depart from the foot of the long stairways that have been cut deep into the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">sides</ENAMEX> of the cliff.
For a complete change of scenery, take a drive northwest towards the hills and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bensafrim</ENAMEX>. Here you can enjoy the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve</ENAMEX> of yesteryear and rolling undeveloped countryside, where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> still live off the land. The tilled soil, a startling ochre color, makes a colorful backdrop for orange and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lemon groves</ENAMEX>. Turn off towards the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barragem da Bravura</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dam</ENAMEX>, and you‚Äôll be rewarded with a sight every bit as inspiring as its name. This <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, more akin to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">English Lake District</ENAMEX> than sunny southern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, is also of great practical use, irrigating <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crops</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX>, around <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lagos</ENAMEX>. A new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> connects with the old <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">EN 125</ENAMEX> route and will undoubtedly open up this relatively undeveloped area.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">portim√£o</ENAMEX> and environs
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Portim√£o</ENAMEX>, second in size only to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Faro</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve</ENAMEX>, is the most workmanlike <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> on the coast. But nestled around it are some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve‚</ENAMEX>Äôs finest beaches, and that has transformed the area into one of the coast‚Äôs most popular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Praia da Rocha</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Praia Tr√™s Irm√£os</ENAMEX> in particular are lined with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> and beach-goers. Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vacationers</ENAMEX> stay along this stretch.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Portim√£o</ENAMEX> sits at the confluence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">River Adade</ENAMEX> and the sea, and most of its local color is down by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port</ENAMEX>, a haven of fishing activity. The top <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>-canning spot on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve, Portim√</ENAMEX>£o is renowned for its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> specializing in sardinhas grelhadas (grilled sardines). Though the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> was settled by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Romans</ENAMEX>, it was one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Algarve</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> most damaged from the earthquake of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1755</TIMEX>, and as a consequence has few <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> or monuments of historical interest. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Largo 1¬∞ de Dezembro</ENAMEX> is a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19th-century</TIMEX> addition, a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> splendid blue-and-white azulejo benches, each illustrating a pivotal event in the history of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX>. The park‚Äôs name alludes to the date, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 1640</TIMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal‚Äôs</ENAMEX> independence from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> was restored (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>).
Much of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town center</ENAMEX> is pedestrian-only and filled with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>. The main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>, at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rua do Com√</ENAMEX>©rcio and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Avenida S√£o Jo√£o de Deus</ENAMEX>, is where you‚Äôll find the large and austere <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Col√</ENAMEX>©gio dos <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jesu√≠tas</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jesuit College</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>, constructed at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the 17th century</TIMEX>, is the largest on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve</ENAMEX>.
Across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plaza</ENAMEX> is the old market building, now used for temporary art exhibitions. Around the corner, along <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Rua Machado</ENAMEX> dos <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Santos</ENAMEX>, is the handsome <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Igreja de Nossa Senhora da Concei√ß√£o</ENAMEX>, sitting atop a small hill and incline of steps. The yellow-and-white <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>, originally constructed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 15th century</TIMEX>, has a beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gothic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">portico</ENAMEX> with carved <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capitals</ENAMEX>, but looks like a colonial church you might find in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brazil</ENAMEX>, due to its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reconstruction</ENAMEX> and remodeling in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 18th and 19th centuries</TIMEX>.
From the center of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> to the waterfront, especially if it‚Äôs anywhere near time for lunch or dinner. You can almost follow your nose toward the heady aroma of grilled sardines. It will take you to the dockside, lined with simple <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> after the other, all serving delicious, smoky sardines (and other fresh-caught <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>). Choose whichever spot seems to be bustling with ravenous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patrons</ENAMEX>. A plate of grilled sardines, prawns, or squid and a bottle of house <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> make a fantastic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meal</ENAMEX>, and the prices are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about as low as anywhere</NUMEX> along the coast.
The hectic operations of the fishing industry used to take place here right under the noses of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vacationers</ENAMEX>, with a frenetic ‚Äúbucket-brigade‚Äù hauling wicker baskets of fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> up from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> holds to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice trays</ENAMEX> and waiting <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trucks</ENAMEX>, right next to dockside dining tables. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fishermen</ENAMEX> have now been pushed to a larger location on the other side of the river, but most sightseeing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> that tour the harbor and nearby grottoes include a quick trip to the new docks. You will still see fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> at anchor on the main quay, but the majority of river traffic here now is private yachts, replica sailing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">tourist</TIMEX> excursions, and tiny dinghies.
Portim√£o‚Äôs other claim to local fame is as a comprehensive regional shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>. There is certainly a good variety of shopping here, including many international names, as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outlets</ENAMEX> selling traditional crafts or locally made items. A market is often set up in the square opposite the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Col√</ENAMEX>©gio dos <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jesu√≠tas.</ENAMEX>
Just <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 miles</NUMEX>) down river from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Portim√</ENAMEX>£o is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Praia da Rocha</ENAMEX>, which became a holiday <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> for wealthy <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> back at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the 19th century</TIMEX>. It was ‚Äúdiscovered‚Äù by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1930s</TIMEX>, when this ‚Äúbeach of rocks,‚Äù strewn with <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">extravagantly</ENAMEX> shaped eroded stacks, provided an inspirational refuge for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intellectuals</ENAMEX>. The belle √©poque <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hotel Bela Vista</ENAMEX> is a living monument from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">those days</TIMEX>.
Today <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the long, 2-km</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1.3 -mile</NUMEX>) golden beach is still the main attraction, but the once-small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> fronting the beach has been swamped by a sea of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> and tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX>. Vestiges of the village‚Äôs former grandeur can still be traced along the front, where grand old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> jostle uncomfortably with high-rise blocks. The sprawl, an uncomfortable update of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mallorca‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Playa de Palma</ENAMEX>, has entirely blurred <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Praia da Rocha‚</ENAMEX>Äôs separate identity from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Portim√£o.</ENAMEX>
At the very eastern end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX>, guarding the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">River Arade</ENAMEX>, is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fortaleza de Santa Catarina de Ribamar</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Catherine‚Äôs Fortress</ENAMEX>), built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1621</TIMEX> to defend <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Silves</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Portim√£o</ENAMEX> against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moors</ENAMEX>. Little remains of the actual fortress, but its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX> is now an agreeable <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terrace</ENAMEX> where you can enjoy a drink and watch the sardine <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">fleet</ENAMEX> returning to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX>. Directly across from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">fort</ENAMEX> is the splendid, beige-colored <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fortaleza de Ferragudo</ENAMEX> (closed to the public), which looks like a giant sandcastle.
The old fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Ferragudo</ENAMEX> nearby is well worth a visit. Despite its proximity to a main tourist enclave, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> excellent beaches of its own, it has resisted blatant commercialization, remaining a traditional fishermen‚Äôs settlement. The opposite end of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Praia da Rocha‚</ENAMEX>Äôs long stretch is known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Praia do Vau</ENAMEX>. The splendid rock formations and coves continue, but this end of the beach is quieter and less developed than the eastern end.
Just west, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Praia de Tr√™s Irm√</ENAMEX>£os is the slightly upscale beach <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cousin</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Praia da Rocha</ENAMEX>. The eastern end of the beach is a beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cove</ENAMEX>, hemmed in by cliffs and ochre rocks. Beyond it, the beach stretches to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alvor</ENAMEX>, a classic Algarvian fishermen‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX>. Narrow cobbled <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> plunge downhill to a quay and market where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boats bob</ENAMEX> at anchor on a wide, marshy lagoon. A handful of tascas and bars rustle up barbecued sardines. At the top of the hill, on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rua da Igreja</ENAMEX>, is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Igreja Matriz</ENAMEX>, a charming <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>, with a delicately carved <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manueline</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">portico</ENAMEX>, perhaps the finest on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve</ENAMEX>, and excellent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">azulejos</ENAMEX> in the chancel. A large white-sand beach is the main focus of a recreational area that includes a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">golf course</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">casino</ENAMEX>.
Between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alvor</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">EN 125</ENAMEX>, the main coastal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>, are the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abicada</ENAMEX> ruins of a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> that dates to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 4th century</TIMEX> a.d.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North of Portim√£o</ENAMEX>, and extending across the western <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX>, is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Serra de Monchique</ENAMEX>, a mountain range that protects the coast from the hot plains farther north. The serra is a verdant landscape of cork, pine, and chestnut <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>, and low-lying areas are covered in wildflowers.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> spots in the serra popular with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monchique</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Caldas de Monchique</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> separate <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">villages</ENAMEX>). The highest point is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">F√≥ia</ENAMEX>. The first stop on the scenic journey along <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">route 266</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">spa</ENAMEX> village of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caldas de Monchique</ENAMEX>, known since <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> times for its therapeutic waters. Its heyday was the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Edwardian</ENAMEX> era, and many of the elegant <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> (including a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">casino</ENAMEX> and a handicrafts market) still date from this period. An air of nostalgia has long presided over this sleepy hollow, but a massive renovation program, still being completed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late 2000</TIMEX>, signals the local desires for widening its tourist appeal. Look for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least five</NUMEX> newly renovated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, and other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> to augment the usual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> in the very near future.
In the meantime, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caldas de Monchique</ENAMEX> is a good place for a picnic and a stroll in the woods. The local <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX> are bottled and for sale across the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North of Caldas</ENAMEX>, the road weaves uphill quickly, rising <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">300 m</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,000 ft</NUMEX>) in <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 miles</NUMEX>) past terraced <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">farmlands</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">forests</ENAMEX> of eucalyptus, <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">oak</ENAMEX>, and cork. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monchique</ENAMEX> is a small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">market town</ENAMEX>, known for its handicrafts and the famous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Manueline</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">portico</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">its 16th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Igreja Matriz</ENAMEX>. The beautiful, uncommon <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> has <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Romanesque</ENAMEX> arches, stone columns, blue-and-yellow azulejos, and a handsome wood ceiling. If you poke around <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, you‚Äôll probably see artisans crafting shoes and pounding out walking sticks in closet-sized workshops.
High above the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, the ruins of a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">convent</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nossa Senhora do Desterro</ENAMEX>, loom like a ghostly gray eminence. Closed to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX>, it has apparently been seized by squatters, who‚Äôve done little towards its upkeep other than festoon it with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚ÄúPrivate‚ÄìFamily‚Äù</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚ÄúFamily Dog‚</ENAMEX>Äù signs.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> continues upwards, passing roadside souvenir and fruit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendors</ENAMEX>, and a few well-placed miradouro <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>. At the end of the line is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">F√≥ia</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost 915</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3,000 ft</NUMEX>) above sea level, affording one of the best views in southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX>. There is no settlement here, just a collection of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">craft</ENAMEX> and souvenir <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stalls</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX>, and an obelisk marking the highest point on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve</ENAMEX>. On a clear day you can see from the bay of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Portim√</ENAMEX>£o to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Sagres</ENAMEX> peninsula, and pick out the rocky outcrops of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lagos</ENAMEX> beaches.
Although you may welcome a breeze after the heat of the coast, the wind blows pretty briskly at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">F√≥ia</ENAMEX>, so you‚Äôll need a jacket or sweater. Don‚Äôt worry if you‚Äôve forgotten to bring <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>; the best buys among the souvenirs here are chunky hand-knitted cardigans and pullovers.
Silves
Back down the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> toward <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portim√£o</ENAMEX>, a turn-off to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Silves</ENAMEX> leads to the former <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Moorish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve</ENAMEX>. More than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eight centuries ago</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Silves</ENAMEX> (then known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chelb</ENAMEX>) was a magnificent <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palaces</ENAMEX>, gardens, bazaars, and a huge red <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> on a hill. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Granada</ENAMEX> had the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alhambra</ENAMEX>, the legendary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moors</ENAMEX>, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve</ENAMEX> also possessed a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> straight out of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Arabian Nights</ENAMEX>.
The golden age of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Silves</ENAMEX> began in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">a.d. 711</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Moslem</ENAMEX> invasion. With redoubtable fortifications and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tens of thousands</NUMEX>, it was one of the strongest outposts in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iberia</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Crusaders</ENAMEX> attacked and took the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1189</TIMEX>, only to see it recovered by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moors</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years later</TIMEX>. A <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decade later</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> Reconquest captured <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Silves</ENAMEX> for good. However, the loss of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Arabic</ENAMEX> wealth and the silting up of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">River Arade</ENAMEX> left <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Silves</ENAMEX> almost literally high and dry, and by the time the bishopric of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve</ENAMEX> was transferred to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Faro</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1577</TIMEX>, the town‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> had dwindled to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">140</NUMEX>.
Its riches were stolen long ago, the once-great river is a silted shadow of its former self, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Silves</ENAMEX> is now just a dusty backwater, but the glorious setting remains. Surmounted by its red fortress, the white <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> climbs the hillside from the river, its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">medieval bridge</ENAMEX> still intact. The old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> inside the gates still evokes the layout of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Jewish quarter</TIMEX> and almedina of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moors</ENAMEX>.
Though a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> of sorts <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Silves</ENAMEX> has existed here since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phoenician</ENAMEX> times, the present <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Castelo</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dos</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mouros</ENAMEX>, on the site of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Visigothic</ENAMEX> foundations, took shape after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reconquest</ENAMEX>, though it preserves distinctly <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Moorish</ENAMEX> lines. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oleander</ENAMEX> and jacaranda soften its bellicose nature, and there are fine views over the tiled roofs of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> and surrounding countryside. A long-destroyed ‚ÄúPalace of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Verandas‚Äù</ENAMEX> once existed within the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX>; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> you can see only a deep well (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">60 m/200 ft</NUMEX>).
Next to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> is the impressive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gothic S√© Velha</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Old Cathedral</ENAMEX>) of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Silves</ENAMEX>, built by the liberating <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Crusaders</ENAMEX>, some of whom are buried within, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 13th century</TIMEX>. The remains of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moorish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX> are hidden behind the altar. Opposite the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S√</ENAMEX>© is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Igreja da Miseric√≥rdia</ENAMEX>, with a classic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manueline</ENAMEX>-style side door.
Wander down to the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pra√</ENAMEX>ßa do <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Municipio</ENAMEX>. The imposing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Torre√£o da Porta da Cidade</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Turret of the City Gate</ENAMEX>) gives you a good idea of how seriously defense of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> was taken. This sturdy, warlike structure now houses the peaceful municipal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> (open to the public). Close by, on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rua das Portas de Loul√©</ENAMEX>, is a modern <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museu Municipal</ENAMEX> (archaeology <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>). Here you can see part of a large <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> water cistern and other local finds.
The hills around <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Silves</ENAMEX> are a prosperous farming <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX>; figs, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oranges</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lemons</ENAMEX>, grapefruit, clementines, and pomegranates are grown in abundance in <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">mile</NUMEX> after mile of orchards.
Just outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, on the road to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S√£o Bartolomeu de Messines</ENAMEX> (route N124), is an important <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16th-century</TIMEX> religious sculpture. Known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cruz de Portugal</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cross</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX>), it depicts the crucifixion of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christ</ENAMEX> on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> face and the descent from the cross on the other. Some speculate that the cross was given to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> upon the transfer of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jo√£o II‚Äôs</ENAMEX> remains to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Batalha</ENAMEX>. The small, weather-beaten <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3-m</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">9-ft</ENAMEX>) statue, easily missed, is really only of interest to aficionados of religious art.
If you are traveling by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>, continue to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barragem</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dam</ENAMEX>) do <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arade</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> collected in this reservoir surrounded by pine hills provides irrigation for the area‚Äôs profitable orchards. It‚Äôs a refreshing spot, perfect for a picnic as well as sailing and windsurfing.
Lagoa, a sizeable town east of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Portim√£o</ENAMEX>, is the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">province‚Äôs wine</ENAMEX> capital. The acidic vinhos <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">da</ENAMEX> casa served in most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Algarve</ENAMEX> come from here. Lagoa <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX>, both red and white, is more powerful than ordinary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX>, and the extra degree or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of alcoholic content can creep up on you. The local tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> can arrange tours of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wineries</ENAMEX> and tastings (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adega de Cooperativa de Lagoa</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tel</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">282/342 181</ENAMEX>; <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX> in advance). New <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">golf courses</ENAMEX> are being built in the area, but there‚Äôs little else to detain <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>.
From <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lagoa</ENAMEX>, turn south <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 5 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 miles</NUMEX>) to the charming <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carvoeiro</ENAMEX>, an archetypal small <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Barlavento</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX>. The beach is about the size of a tablecloth compared with some of the expanses to the east. A single <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> runs down through a pretty valley until it comes to a small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crescent</ENAMEX> of sand shared by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> of sunbathers and fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX>. Above, rows of bright white <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> perch on red <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">sandstone cliffs</ENAMEX> while caf√©s and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> fill the spaces in between. The original village of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carvoeiro</ENAMEX> is now fairly commercialized, but to many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> it remains one of the coast‚Äôs most attractive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX>.
A narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> follows the cliffs eastwards to the geological curiosity of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Algar Seco (‚Äúdry gully‚Äù</ENAMEX>). Among other weird and wonderful shapes, wind and wave erosion have created a double-decker stone <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arch</ENAMEX>. There are walkways down to a lagoon enclosed by menacing rocks, and if weather conditions are calm, this open-air grotto is a paradise for snorkelers.
Continue east and you will find <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> more beaches whose relative isolation has thus far protected them from development. They are (heading east) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vale de Centianes</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Praia do Carvalho</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Praia de Benagil</ENAMEX>. The last <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> in particular is superb, and is approached down a vertiginous road flanked by massive cliffs.
Back inland, just off the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>, is the attractive little village of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Porches</ENAMEX>, with some classic, white <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Algarvian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> and filigreed chimneys. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Porches</ENAMEX> is famous throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX> for its hand-painted pottery, though you won‚Äôt find much in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> itself. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> of greatest renown are along the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">EN 125</ENAMEX> route. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Olaria Algarve</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tel</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">282/352 858</ENAMEX>), better known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Porches Pottery</ENAMEX>, is the biggest and best of these, with highly original designs and unique colors. Inside you can usually see a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trio</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> painting pieces. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">There‚Äôs</ENAMEX> also an attractive little caf√©-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX>, itself decorated (of course) with wonderful <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ceramics</ENAMEX>. A little farther east is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Casa Algarve</ENAMEX>, which sells pottery and handicrafts in an attractive old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>. More than others, it specializes in large-scale azulejo panels.
The coastal development nearby along the cliff tops continues apace. However, the vast majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartments</ENAMEX> and villas here are low-rise, and perhaps because the road system is not fully developed here, this part of the coast has largely escaped the attentions of mass tourism.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the most photographed beaches along this stretch is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nossa Senhora da Rocha</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Our Lady of the Rock</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rock</ENAMEX> in question is a promontory, boldly jutting out into the sea, surmounted by a little white fishermen‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>. On either side of the rock are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> lovely <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-moon coves, framed by cliffs.
The beach of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Arma√ß√£o de P√</ENAMEX>™ra is one of the longest in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Algarve¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†a flat, golden stretch to the east, picturesque rock stacks and small coves to the west. The massive development on the east end of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, though, has pretty much run roughshod over the natural beauty of the area, all but eclipsing the former fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX>. On the front, however, there is a pleasant <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">esplanade</ENAMEX> and a small fortress, built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1760</TIMEX>, which contains a pretty chapel.
ALBUFEIRA
Albufeira, at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time a picturesque fishermen‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, has grown wildly in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX> to become the leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">area</ENAMEX> now generally referred to as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Albufeira</ENAMEX> encompasses the coast from beyond <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gal√</ENAMEX>© in the west all the way to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Praia da Fal√©sia</ENAMEX>, just before a marginally distinct resort <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">area</ENAMEX> begins at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vilamoura</ENAMEX>. Parts of the commercial sprawl, while rarely grotesque, still overwhelm the little <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> at their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>.
Once you‚Äôre off the traffic-squeezed main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">arteries</ENAMEX>, you‚Äôll find that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Albufeira‚</ENAMEX>Äôs old town preserves a surprising bit of traditional charm. The cluster of whitewashed <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> includes a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moorish</ENAMEX> arches and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX>.
Its magnificent <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">setting¬†‚Äî¬†enormous</ENAMEX>, pockmarked sandstone cliffs rise above a huge beach lined with colorful fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">hundreds of sunbathers¬†‚</NUMEX>Äî¬†has proved resistant to development ruin. The gently sloping <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sands</ENAMEX> are perfect for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> holidays, and if you are looking for a little more privacy you can escape the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowds</ENAMEX> by heading farther east along the sandy coast. A <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tunnel</ENAMEX> links the center of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> with the main beach.
When <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">tractors</ENAMEX> haul the fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">fleet</ENAMEX> ashore, sunbathers jump from their towels to gape at the catch¬†‚Äî¬<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">†1-meter</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3-foot</NUMEX>) eels, still flapping; <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">foot-long</NUMEX>, spiny lobsters still snapping; and bucketloads of flat and silver <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>. The famous beachside <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> market buckled under logistics problems <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX> and moved just north of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>. It is still worth a visit, however, and you will also find <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetables</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> on sale.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Albufeira‚Äôs</ENAMEX> name evokes its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Moorish</ENAMEX> roots. Indeed, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">North African</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">occupiers</ENAMEX> called it <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Al-Buhera (‚Äúcastle</ENAMEX> on the sea‚Äù). Its cliff-top position and labyrinthine <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> plan provided an easily defensible spot for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moors</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Albufeira</ENAMEX> proved one of the last <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> to fall during the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reconquest</ENAMEX>. Its layout, however, did not save it from the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">1755 earthquake</ENAMEX>, during which the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> was almost completely destroyed.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Modern Albufeira</ENAMEX> has fallen prey to mass tourism¬<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">†‚Äî¬†international bars</ENAMEX>, caf√©s, and nightspots pump out loud music day and night. There is little traditionally <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> about its raucous central <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>, but there are quiet spots to be found. And what brings all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> here, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX>, is just a splash away. From almost any vantage point, the view of old Albufeira sloping up a gentle hill and its seascape is incredibly spectacular.
With so much activity to the east, the excellent beaches west of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> are relatively uncrowded. The best are <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">S√£o Rafael</ENAMEX>, a beautiful, sandy strip with some splendidly shaped rocky outcrops, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coelha, Castelo</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gal√©</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> small, beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coves</ENAMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the most picturesque <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX> is the lovely village <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alte</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 30 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">18 miles</NUMEX>) north of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Albufeira</ENAMEX>. It is entered in romantic fashion, across a small, white <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX> over a babbling stream that runs through <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX> a rich valley thick with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oranges</ENAMEX>, pomegranates, and figs.
The architectural highlight of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> is the beautiful <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Igreja Matriz</ENAMEX>, entered through a classic Manueline portal. The church <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">keeper</ENAMEX> will enthusiastically point out the many elaborate <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chapels</ENAMEX> and the rare <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Sevillana</ENAMEX> azulejos. The rest of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alte</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">postcards¬†‚Äî¬†white</ENAMEX>-washed <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> along narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>, colorful windows, filigreed chimney pots, and red-tiled roofs. And while their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> may at first seem uniform, you won‚Äôt see <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> the same.
Follow the stream upriver and you come to the popular <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pequena Fonte</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Little Fountain</ENAMEX>) <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">springs</TIMEX>, where a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX> and occasional folk dancing draw <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>. The setting is delightful and a perfect spot for a picnic.
If you continue east on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-124</ENAMEX>, you‚Äôll pass rolling hills and come to the pretty village of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salir</ENAMEX>, which is built on the edge of a steeply rising <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">ridge</ENAMEX> and has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> fine lookout points. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> is in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> itself, alongside <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16th-century</TIMEX> parish <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> and water <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> (don‚Äôt miss the delightful gardens next door). The other, with the best views, is the adjacent peak, which once held a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moorish</ENAMEX> stronghold (follow signs to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Castelo</ENAMEX>). All that remains of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> are the bases of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> huge turrets (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12th‚Äì13th century</TIMEX>) and some excavations. The old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> grounds are home to a tiny <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">hamlet</ENAMEX>, complete with its own <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>. The panoramic views across to the main part of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salir</ENAMEX> and the surrounding countryside are spectacular, and there is even a tiny miradouro (belvedere) caf√© here.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">EAST</ENAMEX> from albufeira
Loosely grouped with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Albufeira</ENAMEX> are beaches to the east. Here, the coastline features the last of the dramatic rock formations that have made the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve</ENAMEX> so famous. At appealing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Olhos</ENAMEX> d‚ÄôAgua, a single <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> leads between pine-covered cliffs down to a soft, sandy beach shared by a gaily painted fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">fleet</ENAMEX>, eroded sandstone formations, and sunbathers. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> derives its name from the ‚Äúeyes of water‚Äù that flow from strangely formed rocks, visible only at low tide.
Fal√©sia is a beautiful beach framed by high cliffs, but to get to it you need to negotiate the grounds of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sheraton Algarve</ENAMEX>, whose elevator down to the beach is for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guests</ENAMEX> only. There are other excellent beaches at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santa Eulalia</ENAMEX> (longer and more open than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Olhos de Agua</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Balaia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Praia da Oura</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S√£o Jo√£o.</ENAMEX> The latter <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> are regarded as satellites of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Albufeira</ENAMEX> and may well be where you are staying on a package holiday to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Albufeira</ENAMEX>. The center of activity along this beach <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hinterland</ENAMEX> is the infamous <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚Äústrip‚Äù¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">long</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> leading up to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">hilltop area</ENAMEX> known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montechoro</ENAMEX>. As the name indicates, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">it‚Äôs</ENAMEX> lined with a motley collection of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bars</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, and nightspots.
Nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vilamoura</ENAMEX> is a wholly planned and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sanitized community¬†‚Äî¬†Europe‚Äôs</ENAMEX> largest ‚Äúfrom-scratch‚Äù private tourist undertaking. From high-rise <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> and sprawling villas that line manicured <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">golf courses</ENAMEX> to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">19th</NUMEX>-hole <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">club bar</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve‚</ENAMEX>Äôs biggest marina, it is undeniably well done, but it could be anywhere. Still, it‚Äôs a major draw for those who have their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clubs</ENAMEX> ready for a golfing vacation; several of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve‚</ENAMEX>Äôs best courses have been sculpted out of the area.
As new as everything looks and feels, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">marina</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designers</ENAMEX> were not the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> to take advantage of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vilamoura‚Äôs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">harbor</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Romans</ENAMEX> built a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dock</ENAMEX> in the same place and established an important fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> here. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> remains of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C√™rro da Villa</ENAMEX> were unearthed across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">marina</ENAMEX>. Aside from some low-level excavations showing the elaborate water-piping system and surviving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mosaics</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ceramics</ENAMEX>, there is also a small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> displaying everything from fishhooks to lamps, appealing to any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> of archaeology.
A little farther west, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Quarteira</ENAMEX>, once a quiet fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX>, is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> virtually unrecognizable, subsumed under an onslaught of rows and rows of apartment <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>. The busy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> has a long, golden beach, and there are good, cheap <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the old quarter</TIMEX> where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locals</ENAMEX> and adventurous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> mingle. The municipal market still stands on the beach; every <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> one of the largest and busiest markets on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Algarve¬†‚Äî¬†offering fish</ENAMEX> and produce¬†‚Äî¬†is held next to it.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">East of Vilamoura</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quarteira</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarvian</ENAMEX> terrain begins to change. The rugged, rocky lines of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Barlavento</ENAMEX> coast west of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Faro</ENAMEX> give way to the long, flat beaches of the east.
The small crossroads <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Almancil</ENAMEX> has <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, caf√©s, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX>, many of which are dedicated to serving <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expatriates</ENAMEX>. But the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, of modest interest itself, is best known for what lies in its vicinity. Many of these ex-pats live just <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a few miles</NUMEX> south on the coast, and it is here that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most luxurious and exclusive resorts are found. Surprisingly, given their status, neither <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vale do Lobo</ENAMEX> nor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quinta do Lago</ENAMEX> are well sign-posted off the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>.
Each is reached down <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">long</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX> that become progressively more private-looking as the beach nears. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vale do Lobo</ENAMEX> means ‚ÄúValley of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Wolves</ENAMEX>,‚Äù but it could just as well mean ‚ÄúValley of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dolls‚Äù</ENAMEX>; it is a security-conscious, maze-like villa community concealed behind a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">giant</ENAMEX>, cheesy entrance gate. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Guards</ENAMEX> do their best to keep the beach the domain of the expatriate and wealthy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourist classes</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quinta do Lago</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a few miles</NUMEX> down the coast, refers to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX> of the same name, once owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prince</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Faisal</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX>, and the luxury <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> that have sprouted up around it. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quinta do Lago</ENAMEX> has one of the finest golf <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve</ENAMEX>, which is designed delicately along the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Ria Formosa Nature Preserve</ENAMEX>. The beach is reached across a long, nostalgic wooden <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX> that crosses wetlands and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bird sanctuaries</ENAMEX>. On the beach is a terrific, if expensive, restaurant for fresh-caught <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>, which you pick out and have grilled.
Back toward <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Almancil</ENAMEX> is one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve‚</ENAMEX>Äôs top attractions, but if you‚Äôre not looking closely, it‚Äôs easy to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">miss. About 16 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 miles</NUMEX>) west of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Faro</ENAMEX>, a simple white <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> stands out on a small hill overlooking the thundering <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">highway</ENAMEX>. A sign simply says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúS</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Louren√ßo‚Äù¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†indicating the turn-off to <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">S√£o Louren√</ENAMEX>ßo do <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matto</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Church of St. Lawrence of the Woods</ENAMEX>). Inside is one of the most extraordinary displays of azulejo design you‚Äôll ever see. Every <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">square inch</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baroque</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">church¬†‚Äî¬†its</ENAMEX> walls, vaulted ceiling, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cupola¬†‚Äî¬†is</ENAMEX> covered with hand-painted, blue-and-white ceramic tiles. Most date from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 18th century</TIMEX> and depict biblical scenes detailing the life of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Lawrence</ENAMEX>, born across the border in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Huesca</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>. The only element of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> not blue-and-white is the carved, gilded altar. The ensemble is a stunning sight, not to be missed.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Loul√©</ENAMEX>, north of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Almancil</ENAMEX>, is a regional produce <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> with a large <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> market, known for its leather, lace, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">copper</ENAMEX> goods. Loul√© is a prosperous <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> with an ambitious, modern <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">boulevard</ENAMEX> complete with outdoor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">caf√</ENAMEX>©s that are jam-packed on market day. Coach <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> come from far and wide to shop at the colorful, bustling market.
There are actually <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> markets. Fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">produce</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>, is sold in a mock-Moorish <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX>, while a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúgypsy market‚</ENAMEX>Äù is held towards the opposite end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">boulevard</ENAMEX>. Just below the permanent market <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">halls</ENAMEX>, on the main <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pra√ßa da Rep√∫blica</ENAMEX>, you‚Äôll find a well-preserved section of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">medieval castle</ENAMEX> walls (which were much damaged by the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">1755 earthquake</ENAMEX>). The ramparts afford excellent views from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, and set into the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> remains is a modest local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>. Also worth visiting are the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Igreja Matriz</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S√£o Clemente</ENAMEX>), a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Gothic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th-century</TIMEX> azulejo tiles; the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Convento da Gra√ßa</ENAMEX>, with a terrific <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Manueline</ENAMEX> portal; and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ermida de Nossa Senhora da Concei√ß√£o</ENAMEX>, a small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> prized for its Baroque altar and ceramic tiles.
In the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> directly below the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> walls, you may well hear the sounds of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">craftsmen</ENAMEX> beating <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">copper¬†‚Äî¬†from</ENAMEX> whom you can buy direct. You can also see artisans at work on the pottery wheel, producing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">leather goods</ENAMEX> (such as decorated <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">saddles</ENAMEX> and bridles) and furniture. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">craftsmen</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Loul√</ENAMEX>© are said to be the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">descendants</ENAMEX> of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslims</ENAMEX> who found refuge in the district at the end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reconquest</ENAMEX>. If you are in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve</ENAMEX> in springtime, don‚Äôt miss the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Loul√© Carnival</ENAMEX>. The parades, ‚ÄúBattle of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Flowers</ENAMEX>,‚Äù and musical celebrations are the best of their kind in the region.
The flower-lined <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Loul√© to S√£o Br√°s de Alportel</ENAMEX>, another <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">market town</ENAMEX> and site of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> government pousadas (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">inns</ENAMEX>) along the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve</ENAMEX>, passes through rolling orchards of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fig</ENAMEX>, olive, and orange <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>. It‚Äôs best to visit the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX>, when the lively market transforms its otherwise sleepy character. You may wish to pay a visit to the charming <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Museu Etnogr√</ENAMEX>°fico do <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trajo Alg√°rvio</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum of Algarvian Costumes</ENAMEX>), where exhibits of local dress are well staged in a large, old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">90 m</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100 yards</NUMEX>) or so off the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>.
In this northern part of the southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX>, life is visibly slower and more rustic; bonneted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ladies</ENAMEX> in black walk along the roadside, old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> bounce up and down on donkeys, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> pluck almonds from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> with long sticks.
On the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> toward <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Faro</ENAMEX> is a pair of historical sights. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pal√°cio de Est√≥i</ENAMEX> is a most curious find. The charming <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rococo</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX>, found through a small side gate just to the left of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> steps in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town center</ENAMEX>, once belonged to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dukes of Est√≥i</ENAMEX>. Begun in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-18th century</TIMEX>, in palatial terms, it‚Äôs rather small, abandoned and visibly dilapidated, and only the gardens are open to the public. Yet it is a spectacular sight. Its faded glory includes balustrade terraces and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">staircases</ENAMEX> with splendid bursts of bougainvillea, busts of historic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> impaled on the parapets, brightly colored wall tiles, and formal gardens. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> and gardens have been acquired by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>, which aims to construct a pousada (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inn</ENAMEX>) here. If and when that project is completed, it should become one of the most interesting of the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX>.
The dusty <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Villa Romana de Milreu</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> ruins of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Milreu</ENAMEX>) is 1.5km (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 mile</NUMEX>) down the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> toward <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Faro</ENAMEX> (a small sign on the side of the road reads <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚ÄúRuinas de Milreu‚Äù</ENAMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Some 1,400</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palace</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Est√≥i</ENAMEX> was erected, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milreu</ENAMEX> was also the large <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country house</ENAMEX> of an eminent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>. The knee-high walls that trace the outline of this once luxury <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">establishment</ENAMEX> are still clearly visible. The tall, semi-circular tower ruin is thought to have been a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> to pagan <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water gods</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time; however, by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fifth century</TIMEX> it had clearly been converted to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>.
FARO
Faro, the provincial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve</ENAMEX>, is also the one that seems to get the least respect from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX>. Many fly into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Faro</ENAMEX>, beeline directly to their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX>, and return <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks later</TIMEX>, bypassing the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX>. Those who take the time¬†‚Äî¬†a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX> is sufficient¬†‚Äî¬†to explore <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Faro</ENAMEX> find an atmosphere quite distinct from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX>-heavy coast. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Faro</ENAMEX> has a greater wealth of cultural and historic monuments than any other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Algarvian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, a picturesque old <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">quarter</TIMEX>, and best of all, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> never overrun authentic <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, caf√©s, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bars</ENAMEX>.
Faro was always an important <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, even during <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> times, when it was allowed to coin its own money. It continued to thrive under the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arabs</ENAMEX>; its name may be derived from the name <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harune</ENAMEX>, one of the old city‚Äôs ruling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christians</ENAMEX> recaptured <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Faro</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1249</TIMEX>, completing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reconquest</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> prospered, becoming the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Episcopal</ENAMEX> see of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bishop of the Algarve</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1577</TIMEX>. But in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1596</TIMEX>, when it was <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> territory, an <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> fleet commanded by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Queen Elizabeth I‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">favorite</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Earl</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Essex</ENAMEX>, sacked and burned the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX>.
Until comparatively recently, when the area silted into a tidal flat, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Faro</ENAMEX> was a commercial and fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX> open to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX>. Indeed, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Earl</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Essex‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">fleet</ENAMEX> had sailed right up to the city‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> fortifications. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> small fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> and pleasure craft must zigzag carefully amid the dunes and then creep beneath the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">railway bridge</ENAMEX> to enter the sleepy harbor.
The main entrance to the circular old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, near the harbor, is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arco da Vila</ENAMEX>, a charming arch and bell <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> habitually crowned by a venerable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of nesting storks. Beyond the arch, a cobbled <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>, worn slick by centuries of tramping feet, leads up to the splendid expanse of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Largo da S√©</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Cathedral Square</ENAMEX>), best seen in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the evening</TIMEX> when floodlit and free of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">S√©‚Äôs unusual cathedral</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX>, main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">portico</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">interior chapels</ENAMEX> are all that remain of the original <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Gothic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>. Inside are some fine examples of azulejos and superb statues and carvings, one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve‚</ENAMEX>Äôs top collections of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17th- and 18th-century</TIMEX> sacred art. Climb the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> for fine views over the whole of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Faro</ENAMEX>. At last visit, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">cathedral</ENAMEX> was undergoing a massive restoration project, both inside and out, as it has since it was attacked by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> and later damaged by the great earthquake. Until that project is finished, entrance is through a side door.
Across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sede Episcopal</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Episcopal Palace</ENAMEX>), an excellent example of the plain ch√£ style prevalent during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th century</TIMEX>. To its right is the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">C√¢mara Municipal</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Town Hall</ENAMEX>).
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Convento de Nossa Senhora da Assun√ß√£o</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Convent of Our Lady of the Assumption</ENAMEX>), which contains the most beautiful cloister in southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve</ENAMEX>, it was constructed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16th century</TIMEX> on the site of the old <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Jewish quarter</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Faro</ENAMEX> had a sizeable <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Middle Ages</TIMEX>). Abandoned as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">convent</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th century</TIMEX> and then put to improbable use as a cork <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factory</ENAMEX>, it has now been beautifully restored as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> devoted to archaeology, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Museu Arqueol√≥gico Infante Dom Henrique</ENAMEX>. The principal exhibit is a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2,000-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> floor <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">mosaic</TIMEX> measuring <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> ft) long and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3 m</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> ft) wide. Unearthed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Faro</ENAMEX>, it is nicknamed the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚ÄúOcean Mosaic,‚Äù for it</ENAMEX> depicts a bearded sea-god (though the bulldozer that discovered it in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1976</TIMEX> shaved off the lower <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of his face). There are also busts taken from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> ruins at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Milreu</ENAMEX>. Displays of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> art are housed in the many <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> off the cloister.
Nearby is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ermida de Nossa Senhora do Repouso</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Hermitage of Our Lady of Rest</ENAMEX>), a tiny <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">chapel</ENAMEX> carved out of the ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Moorish</ENAMEX> arches.
The real attraction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Faro‚</ENAMEX>Äôs old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, however, is not its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">set-piece buildings</ENAMEX>, but the quiet, hidden, timeless flavor of its tiny <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>, and narrow, cobbled alleyways. A good place to sit and absorb some of it is the friendly <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Caf√© do Largo</ENAMEX>, where classical music accompanies your <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX>.
Just outside the old <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">quarter</TIMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Igreja de S√£o Francisco</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Church of the Third Order of St. Francis</ENAMEX>), begun in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 17th century</TIMEX>. Narrative tiles adorn the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chapel</ENAMEX> and vaulted ceiling, which displays a terrific <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coronation</ENAMEX> of the Virgin <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary</ENAMEX>.
In the center of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, across from the harbor, the cobbled and shaded municipal <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jardim Manuel B√≠var</ENAMEX>, created in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 15th century</TIMEX> as the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Queen‚Äôs Square</ENAMEX>, is a popular meeting place for young and old alike. In its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> are an open-air caf√© and an old-fashioned bandstand. Several handsome 16th‚<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Äì18th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansions</ENAMEX> surround the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>, including the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Banco de Portugal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pal√°cio Belmar√ßo.</ENAMEX>
As in several other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Algarve</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX>, the main shopping area of central <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Faro</ENAMEX> is pedestrian-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only</NUMEX>, and caf√©s and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> spill out onto the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> displays and all. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rua de Santo Ant√≥nio</ENAMEX> is the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">thoroughfare</ENAMEX>. At its far end is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museu Etnogr√°fico</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ethnographic Museum</ENAMEX>), with displays of local handicrafts, reconstructions of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> in a typical Algarvian <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>, and a colorful water-<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cart</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Manuel Ignacio Miguel</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Olh√£o</ENAMEX> operated for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60 years</TIMEX>, almost up to his death in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1974</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> sits on the edge of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Faro‚Äôs Mouraria</ENAMEX>, or old Moorish <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">quarter</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">It‚Äôs</ENAMEX> worth wandering the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> that lead to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Largo do P√© da Cruz</ENAMEX> and the attractive little <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">chapel</ENAMEX> of the same name (Our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lady</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Foot</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cross</ENAMEX>).
The new <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, an expansion dating from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th century</TIMEX>, is west of here. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX>, which face each other across a large and congested <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plaza</ENAMEX>, are worth seeing. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Igreja de S√£o</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pedro</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Church</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">St. Peter</ENAMEX>) is the smaller of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>, built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16th century</TIMEX>. It has a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">carved Baroque retable</ENAMEX> and a couple of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rococo</ENAMEX> chapels.
But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Faro‚</ENAMEX>Äôs finest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Igreja do Carmo</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Carmelite</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Church</ENAMEX>), which took most of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 18th century</TIMEX> to build. The promise of its twin <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">belltowers</ENAMEX> and stately fa√ßade is matched by a beautiful gilded interior, but the greatest attraction is the macabre <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Capela dos Ossos</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Chapel</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bones</ENAMEX>). <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">This 19th-century</TIMEX> curiosity, like a similar chapel in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of √âvora farther north, is constructed of the skulls and bones of monks, unearthed from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">friars‚Äô cemetery</ENAMEX>. Depending on your tolerance for such things, it is either fascinating or sick beyond belief.
Less ghastly is the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Jewish Cemetery</ENAMEX>, on the outskirts of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> (off <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Rua Le√£o Penedo</ENAMEX>, near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pra√</ENAMEX>ßa dos <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bomberos de Faro</ENAMEX>). Dating to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 19th century</TIMEX>, it has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one hundred</NUMEX> tombstones in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Hebrew</ENAMEX>, testimony to the once-important <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Faro</ENAMEX>.
Few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> seem to do it, but it is well worth spending <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a night</TIMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Faro</ENAMEX>, especially if you‚Äôve already spent some time in a traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Algarvian</ENAMEX> beach <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX>. Watch the sun setting over the fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> in the lagoon while you have a drink in the splendidly old-fashioned, cavernous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caf√© Alian√ßa</ENAMEX>, the city‚Äôs oldest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">caf√©</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Faro</ENAMEX> also has some lively music <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX>.
Faro‚Äôs beach, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Praia de Faro</ENAMEX>, is noted for its watersports. You can drive there across the single-lane causeway linking the long, strip of dunes with the mainland (no <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">buses</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">motor homes</ENAMEX> allowed), or in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX> catch a ferry from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pier</ENAMEX> by the old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>. If the ocean is rough, simply cross to the opposite side of the sand spit and swim in the calm, warmer waters of the lagoon (though be aware, it can sometimes be muddy and a little unpleasant).
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sotavento Coast</ENAMEX>
Heading east from the provincial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Faro</ENAMEX>, the first settlement of any size you will come to is the colorful fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Olh√£o.</ENAMEX> A working <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX>, it has made few concessions to tourism and is full of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Olh√£o</ENAMEX> has often been described as the ‚Äúlittle white <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cubist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve</ENAMEX>,‚Äù its architecture likened to that of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">North African</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX>. That may have been the case <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">some years ago</TIMEX>, but modern development has strongly interfered with its once distinctive appearance. You can <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> for yourself by ascending the bell <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> of the parish <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> (which also goes by the name of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nossa Senhora do Ros√°rio</ENAMEX>), which you will find by winding your way through the narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> back to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pra√ßa da Restaura√ß√£o</ENAMEX> (you may have to ask for access to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> in the sacristy). Founded by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">King Dom Pedro II</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1698</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> has an impressive, scroll-decorated <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Baroque fa√ßade</ENAMEX>, brilliant white <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dome</ENAMEX>, stone <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">belltower</ENAMEX>, and a chapel at the rear, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nossa Senhora</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dos</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aflitos</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Our Lady of the Afflicted</ENAMEX>), where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> often pray when their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fishermen husbands</ENAMEX> are away at sea.
Instead of the red-tiled roofs and filigreed chimneys seen elsewhere in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Olh√</ENAMEX>£o skyline comprises flat-topped roofs of terraces called <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">a√ßoeitas</ENAMEX>. Look hard and you can still see the narrow, outside <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">staircases</ENAMEX> leading to white-washed <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">towers</ENAMEX>, where fishermen‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wives</ENAMEX>, or perhaps smugglers, would look out for the incoming <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">fleet</ENAMEX>.
The name of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pra√ßa da Restaura√ß√£o (‚ÄúRestoration Square‚Äù</ENAMEX>), recalls <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Olh√</ENAMEX>£o‚Äôs most glorious moment, when an improvised local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX> rebelled against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Napoleon‚Äôs</ENAMEX> occupying forces in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1808</TIMEX>. This insurrectionary zeal subsequently spread throughout the rest of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX> and resulted in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Olh√</ENAMEX>£o being awarded the title <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚ÄúNoble Town of the Restoration</ENAMEX>.‚Äù
Olh√£o‚Äôs fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port</ENAMEX> is worth a look. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fishermen</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> have a reputation for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hardiness¬†‚Äî¬†some</ENAMEX> used to earn a living in cod waters as far off as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newfoundland</ENAMEX>. During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past two centuries</TIMEX>, however, some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sailors</ENAMEX> have turned away from fishing and instead, taken to the cargo trade between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North Africa</ENAMEX>. This relatively recent link with the neighboring continent may have been the inspiration for the local <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">North African</ENAMEX> style of architecture. In any case, it developed long after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moors</ENAMEX> had left the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve</ENAMEX>.
You‚Äôre unlikely to see a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> coming in from another continent, but you are guaranteed the hustle, bustle, sights, smells, and sounds of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Olh√£o fish</ENAMEX> market, one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve‚</ENAMEX>Äôs best (the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> is especially famous for its mussels and other shellfish). Adjacent to the voluminous market <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> are small, well-tended <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX>, one of which boasts several splendid benches decorated with blue-and-white azulejos. Just beyond the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> on the other side, ferryboats depart regularly in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> for the barrier-island beaches of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Armona</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Culatra</ENAMEX> just offshore. These lovely, undeveloped beaches are the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jewels</ENAMEX> of the coastline between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Faro</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tavira</ENAMEX>.
A little farther along the coast, at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fuzeta</ENAMEX>, is another popular beach. There is some holiday development here, but as yet only on a small scale. Fuseta itself is little more than a creek of gaily-painted <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> bobbing at anchor, while in the background local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> rake salt crystals into small white mountains punctuating the saline delta.
Turn inland, because the small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moncarapacho</ENAMEX>, with a fine old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>, a sleepy <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> square, and a local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>, is well worth the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8-km</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5-mile</NUMEX>) detour. The countryside around here is full of orange and almond groves and, as you head east (back on the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>) towards <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Tavira</ENAMEX>, olive <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">groves</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">vineyards</ENAMEX> also start to appear. Tavira‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">grapes</ENAMEX> produce a good, rustic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> consumed all over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East Toward Spain</ENAMEX>
After the salty flavor of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Olh√£o</ENAMEX> and the rural <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">serenity of Moncarapacho</ENAMEX>, the aristocratic bearings of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tavira</ENAMEX>, one of the true gems of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve</ENAMEX>, may come as something of a surprise. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the region‚Äôs most historic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>, its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moorish, Reconquista</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> roots are clearly visible.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1500s</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tavira</ENAMEX> had the largest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve</ENAMEX>. This tuna-fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port</ENAMEX> and self-assured <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of historic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX>, imposing classical-style <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansions</ENAMEX>, and riverfront gardens probably dates back as far as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phoenicians</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carthaginians</ENAMEX>. In fact, its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX>-arched stone <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> origin is still in use.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tavira‚Äôs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX>, in the center of the casco hist√≥rico (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">old quarter</TIMEX>), was a defensive <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> built by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moors</ENAMEX>. Climb the walls for a superb panoramic view of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, but be careful, as the ramparts have no guardrails. Within the walls is an attractive, fragrant <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garden</ENAMEX>.
The walls look directly onto the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Igreja de Santa Maria do Castelo</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Church of St. Mary of the Castle</ENAMEX>), most likely built on the site of the old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gothic</ENAMEX> portal is the only original <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13th-century</TIMEX> part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> to have survived the devastating <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1755</TIMEX> earthquake. In the chancel is the large <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tomb</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Dom Paio Peres Correia</ENAMEX>, who drove the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moors</ENAMEX> out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tavira</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1242</TIMEX>.
Across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>, the ochre-colored former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">convent</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Convento da Gra√ßa</ENAMEX>, is being converted into a pousada (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inn</ENAMEX>) by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>.
Just down the hill, off <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Rua Galeria</ENAMEX> near the river, is the beautiful <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Igreja da Miseric√≥rdia</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Church of Mercy</ENAMEX>), a spectacular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> edifice. The carved <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">portico</ENAMEX> is especially fine, with a statue of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Our Lady of Mercy</ENAMEX> under a canopy. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">The 18th-century</TIMEX> interior contains excellent specimens of carved retables and tiles. There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two dozen</NUMEX> other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tavira</ENAMEX>; also worth a visit¬†‚Äî¬†though you may find them closed‚Äö¬†‚Äî¬†are <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 13th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Igreja de Santiago</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. James Church</ENAMEX>), near the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> walls, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Igreja de Sao Paulo</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Church of St. Paul</ENAMEX>), across the river on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pra√</ENAMEX>ßa <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Padinha</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>, part of a former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monastery</ENAMEX>, has a unique feature: the floor of the transept is paved with bricks and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stones</ENAMEX> painted with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">figures</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rua da Liberdade</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tavira‚</ENAMEX>Äôs main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>, is lined with stately <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansions</ENAMEX>. A walk down any of the city‚Äôs old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> will reveal handsome details of noble <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>, such as double windows and latticed doors. A lively <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX> and vegetable market is held by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">River Gil√£o</ENAMEX>, and it is well worth crossing the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX> to view more of the town‚Äôs elegant <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> and pretty flower-filled squares. Many of those <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> have sloping triangular roofs, called tesouros (treasures).
A nice excursion from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tavira</ENAMEX> is to the nearby island <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ilha de Tavira</ENAMEX>, where there is a huge and thoroughly appealing beach backed by sand dunes. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jetties</ENAMEX> leave from a point, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quatro √Åguas</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a couple of km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">one mile</NUMEX>) east of town.
Back on the mainland, a turn-off of the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> east (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">EN-125</ENAMEX>, still!) of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tavira</ENAMEX> leads a small number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> to a perfectly enchanting little whitewashed village overlooking the sea. Pretty <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cacela Velha</ENAMEX> can‚Äôt have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhabitants</ENAMEX>. It has an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>, a telephone <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">booth</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cemetery</ENAMEX>, an old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">well</ENAMEX>, and a handful of well-tended, blue-and-white houses festooned with <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>. Below the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, along a spit of sand that‚Äôs part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ria</ENAMEX> (estuary), are a few moored fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">East</ENAMEX> of here lies the fledgling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manta Rota</ENAMEX>, a former fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX>, and the high-rise canyons of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Monte Gordo</ENAMEX>. The reason behind all this development is a long sandy beach, which stretches undisturbed for some <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6 miles</NUMEX>) between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX> and is backed by pine <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> and dunes. Although the last in a long line of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Algarve</ENAMEX> beach <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX> (or the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, if you‚Äôre coming from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>) is not, by a long shot, the coast‚Äôs most attractive, the beach and watersports <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monte Gordo</ENAMEX> are enough to attract and entertain many serious sun-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">seekers</ENAMEX>. By <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">casino</ENAMEX> is the focus of attention.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Guadiana River</ENAMEX>, which runs into the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 miles</NUMEX>) east of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Monte Gordo</ENAMEX>, served as a natural frontier for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2,000 years</TIMEX>, forming the boundary between the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">provinces</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lusitania</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baetica</ENAMEX> (southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>). This explains the strategic importance of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Castro Marim</ENAMEX>, a former fortress town rising from the flatlands to command the broad river. For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five centuries</TIMEX> its primitive <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX>-fortress was occupied by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moors</ENAMEX>. After the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reconquest</ENAMEX> it became the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">home</ENAMEX> of the new <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Military Order of Christ</ENAMEX> (succeeding the disbanded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Knights Templars</ENAMEX>). Look for the inscription inside the main entrance proclaiming that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prince</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry the Navigator</ENAMEX>, who was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX> of the order, once lived here. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">These days</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> itself is in need of defense and restoration, and although it may no longer be of any military value, its broad, unpolluted marshlands do attract large numbers of wading <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX>. The area is protected by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Parks</ENAMEX> service and is very popular with birdwatchers.
A little to the south, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vila Real de Santo Ant√≥nio</ENAMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Town of St. Anthony</ENAMEX>) is the last of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Algarve‚Äôs</ENAMEX> beach <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> before <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> was designed to be as grand as its name suggests, in order to impress the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> on the other side of the river. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> plan was the inspiration of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marqu√™s of Pombal</ENAMEX>, the dynamic hatchet <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">King Jos√© I</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> was built from scratch in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">just five months</TIMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1774</TIMEX>, aping the grid layout of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lisbon‚Äôs Baixa</ENAMEX> (lower <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">city</ENAMEX>).
The town <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pra√ßa do Marqu√™s do Pombal</ENAMEX>, is the work of the royal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX>, and the tour de force of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Vila Real</ENAMEX>. The pavement‚Äôs black and white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wedges</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stone radiate</ENAMEX> from an obelisk in the center of the square like rays from the sun. Distinguished <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-story, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late 18th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> line the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>, and orange <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> soften the edges, adding color and scent. Visit the small <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Manuel Cabanas Museum</ENAMEX>, just off the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>, to see a nice collection of woodcuts that ranges from rustic scenes to famous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">statesmen</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">composers</ENAMEX>.
Today <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Vila Real</ENAMEX> is sleepy but quietly dignified. A walk around the old <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">quarter</TIMEX> reveals a number of fine, brightly painted <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> along pedestrian-only <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vila Real de Santo Ant√≥nio‚</ENAMEX>Äôs main appeal is as the ferry <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ayamonte</ENAMEX> across the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">The trip</ENAMEX> takes <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">just 20 minutes¬</TIMEX>†‚Äî¬†less time than it would take to drive to and over the new bridge¬†‚Äî¬†and the white <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ayamonte</ENAMEX> is a fine sight as you approach it from the river. Crossing into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>, you will need to take your passport.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Excursion</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lisbon</ENAMEX>
Until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th century</TIMEX>, the overland journey from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lisbon</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal‚Äôs</ENAMEX> capital <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, took a week or more. Now it‚Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only half</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a day</TIMEX> (or even less) by <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> or rail, and you can fly from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Faro</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">just 40 minutes</TIMEX>. If you only have <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of days</TIMEX> to spend in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lisbon</ENAMEX>, however, you might want to consider an all-inclusive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coach</ENAMEX> excursion from the coast, which takes care of accommodation and sightseeing.
For many years <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lisbon</ENAMEX> has enjoyed a reputation as a relatively quiet, easy-going sort of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, lacking the hustle, bustle, and general hassle of other major <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>. But while this is still true to a degree, the gap is now closing and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lisbon</ENAMEX> is becoming altogether more <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX>.
The center of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lisbon</ENAMEX> is small, compact, and easy to get around in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">just a couple of days</TIMEX>. Moreover, it boasts <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> charming old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">quarters</ENAMEX> as full of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> as any place in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. If, you have <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than two days</TIMEX>, it is well worth visiting the surrounding region. The popular <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Estoril coast</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cascais</ENAMEX>, and the beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">hilltop</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sintra</ENAMEX> are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of the most popular excursions.
Exploring <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lisbon</ENAMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> is built on <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">hills¬†‚Äî¬†by</ENAMEX> legend <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX>, in fact many more¬†‚Äî¬†but the great thing for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitor</ENAMEX> is the splendid vantage points and lookouts that these provide. The best place to start your tour of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lisbon</ENAMEX> is from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moors‚</ENAMEX>Äô old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Castelo de S√</ENAMEX>£o <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jorge</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX> of all vantage points. From here you can look out over the whole of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> and along the broad <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rio Tejo</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">River Tagus</ENAMEX>), spanned by the longest suspension <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> is set just above <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lisbon‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most famous bairro (district), the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alfama</ENAMEX>. Here you will discover a labyrinth of narrow, crooked <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>, cobbled alleyways, decaying old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>, former <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palaces</ENAMEX>, fish <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stalls</ENAMEX>, and bars totally unknown to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX>. Little has changed here in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX>, if not <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX>.
Another majestic view of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> is from the charming <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Miradouro de Santa Luzia</ENAMEX>, just down the hill from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX>. Close by is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S√©</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cathedral</ENAMEX>), which has an ancient, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cavernous interior¬†‚Äî¬†one</ENAMEX> of perhaps <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a dozen</NUMEX> first-class <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. Adjacent to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">cathedral</ENAMEX> is the lovely <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Igreja de Santo Ant√≥nio da S√©</ENAMEX>, named for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lisbon‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patron saint</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Anthony of Padua</ENAMEX>.
Just beyond the dense <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">quarters</TIMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alfama</ENAMEX>, is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S√£o Vicente de Fora</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Vincent Beyond the Walls</ENAMEX>), an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italianate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> and monastic cloister. The latter is the true highlight: its courtyards are lined with blue-and-white azulejos, and the views from the roof are among the best in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>.
Down toward the river is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museu Nacional</ENAMEX> do <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Azulejo</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Azulejo Museum</ENAMEX>), devoted entirely to the art of painted and glazed ceramic tiles, a national art form. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">About 12,000</NUMEX> azulejos are on show here, from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15th-century</TIMEX> polychrome designs to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20th-century</TIMEX> art deco. A prized possession is the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lisbon Panorama</ENAMEX>, a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">36m</NUMEX>- (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">118ft-</ENAMEX>) long tile composition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lisbon‚Äôs</ENAMEX> riverside as it looked before the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">1755 earthquake</ENAMEX>. 
Like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alfama</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bairro Alto</ENAMEX> (upper <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">city</ENAMEX>) is a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">hilly</NUMEX> area full of evocative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> decorated with wrought-iron <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">balconies</ENAMEX> usually occupied by birdcages and flowerpots. At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">district</ENAMEX> is loaded with exciting atmosphere and is famous for its fado <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clubs</ENAMEX>. It‚Äôs a relatively harmless place by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX>, but you should be on your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guard</ENAMEX> if visiting after dark.
Perched on the edge of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bairro Alto</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Igreja do Carmo</ENAMEX>, devastated in the earthquake of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1755</TIMEX> but deliberately preserved as an atmospheric ruin and potent reminder of its impact. Nearby, the sumptuous, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Igreja de S√£o Roque</ENAMEX>, features a small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> of sacred art.
You can walk to this area easily from the central squares, but it‚Äôs also fun to go by tram or instead to board the landmark <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">30-meter</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">98-foot</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Elevador de Santa Justa</ENAMEX>, which you‚Äôll find just off the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Rossio</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baixa</ENAMEX>, the lower <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">This 1902</TIMEX> Victorian marvel of iron and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glass</ENAMEX> was built by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Raul Mesnier</ENAMEX>. The longer, slower way back downhill meanders through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">upmarket</ENAMEX> shopping area of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chiado</ENAMEX>, now totally rebuilt after a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX> fire that swept through the district.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baixa</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lisbon‚</ENAMEX>Äôs principal business district. The main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pra√ßa Dom Pedro IV</ENAMEX>, better known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rossio</ENAMEX>. Look out for the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">railway station</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Esta√ß√£o do Rossio</ENAMEX>, which looks like a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moorish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> with horseshoe arches, just west of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">blocks</ENAMEX> north is another lively <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pra√</ENAMEX>ßa dos <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Restauradores</ENAMEX>, which leads to the leafy main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">thoroughfare</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Avenida da Liberdade</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> plunges steeply downhill to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">River Tagus</ENAMEX> and its most imposing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pra√ßa do Com√©rcio</ENAMEX>, lined on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sides</ENAMEX> by gracious arcaded <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> and a vast triumphal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arch</ENAMEX>. The grand <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>, wholly wiped out by the great earthquake of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1755</TIMEX>, has seen its share of watershed political events: <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carlos</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> were felled by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">assassin‚Äôs bullets</ENAMEX> in the pra√ßa in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1908</TIMEX>, and one of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> uprisings of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Carnation Revolution of 1974</ENAMEX> was staged in this place.
Moving west and down toward the river from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pra√ßa do Com√</ENAMEX>©rcio is the elegant residential neighborhood called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Lapa</ENAMEX>. Its standout sight is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museu Nacional de Arte Antiga</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Museum of Ancient Art</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Portugal‚</ENAMEX>Äôs largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>. Among its pieces of international renown are <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Adoration of St Vincent</ENAMEX>, a multi-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> work attributed to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 15th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">master</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nuno Gon√ßalves</ENAMEX>; and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Temptation of St. Anthony</ENAMEX>, a fantastic hallucination by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hieronymus Bosch</ENAMEX>, tempered with humor and executed with mad <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genius</ENAMEX>.
Some <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4 miles</NUMEX>) west of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pra√</ENAMEX>ßa do <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Com√©rcio</ENAMEX> lies the riverside <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">district of Bel√©m</ENAMEX>. It was from here that the age of exploration (begun on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve</ENAMEX>) reached its zenith <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1497 and 1499</TIMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vasco da Gama‚</ENAMEX>Äôs voyage to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> opened up a major new sea route. During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the following century</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX> enjoyed a golden age of trade, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Manuel</ENAMEX> celebrated the discoverers with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> magnificent monuments.
The most famous is the small but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">exquisitely</ENAMEX> formed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Torre de Bel√©m</ENAMEX>, as romantic a medieval fortress as you will ever see (particularly by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>, when it is magically floodlit). By contrast the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">majestic Mosteiro</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dos</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jer√≥nimos</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lisbon‚</ENAMEX>Äôs largest religious monument and a truly formidable example of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Manueline</ENAMEX> architecture. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> and its double-decker <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cloister</ENAMEX> survived the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">1755 earthquake</ENAMEX>, and in addition to royal tombs holds the relics of national <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heroes</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vasco da Gama</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Luis de Cam√µes</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monastery houses</ENAMEX> an archaeology <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>, and next door is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Museu da Marinha</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Naval Museum</ENAMEX>). Back down the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> toward <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lisbon</ENAMEX> is the highly popular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museu Nacional</ENAMEX> dos <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Coches</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Coach Museum</ENAMEX>), which is located in the former riding school of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bel√©m Royal Palace</ENAMEX>.
One final sight in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bel√</ENAMEX>©m is the modern <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Monument to the Discoverers</ENAMEX>. This huge, splendid waterfront sculpture depicts <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prince</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry the Navigator</ENAMEX> at the prow of a stylized caravel that juts into the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tagus River</ENAMEX>. The figures behind represent noted explorers, map-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">makers</ENAMEX>, and astronomers whom <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prince Henry</ENAMEX> mobilized in order to launch <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX> into the history books.
Lisbon‚Äôs newest attraction is the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> designed for the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World Expo ‚</ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Äô98</NUMEX>, which did much to reinvigorate the industrial eastern section of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. Continuing to draw <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> to the riverfront <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parque das Na√ß√µes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nations Park</ENAMEX>) is its world-class <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">aquarium</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ocean√°rio de Lisboa</ENAMEX>, perhaps the world‚Äôs top <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">aquarium</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> is easily accessible by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metro</ENAMEX> (subway).
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Estoril Coast</ENAMEX>
Excursions follow the coast west from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lisbon</ENAMEX>, as the riverfront evolves into a series of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic Ocean</ENAMEX> beaches. The most famous is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Estoril</ENAMEX>, a resort <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 24 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">15 miles</NUMEX>) from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lisbon</ENAMEX>. A haven for deposed <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">royalty</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first half of this century</TIMEX>, it retains a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">jet</ENAMEX>-set image, with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Victorian</ENAMEX> villas and modern <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansions</ENAMEX>. The famous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">casino</ENAMEX>, located at the top of the gardens of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Parque do Estoril</ENAMEX>, combines a night-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">club</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX>, exhibition <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cinema</ENAMEX>.
In contrast to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Estoril‚</ENAMEX>Äôs pretentions, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cascais</ENAMEX> is an agreeable combination of fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX> for aristocrats, and tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX>. Overlooking the main swimming/fishing beach, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 13th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">citadel</ENAMEX> is one of the few <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> to have survived the earthquake and tidal wave of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1755</TIMEX>.
Queluz
An easy <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">half-day</TIMEX> outing is to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Queluz</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">14 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">8 miles</NUMEX>) west of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lisbon</ENAMEX> on the way to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sintra</ENAMEX> (see below), home to the pretty pink palace commissioned by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pedro III</ENAMEX>. The sumptuous summer <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> was built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the second half of the 18th century</TIMEX> and thrived during the reign of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maria</ENAMEX> I (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1777‚Äì1799</ENAMEX>). The interior is a model of only slightly tattered splendor, but the exquisite <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palace Gardens</ENAMEX> are the pride of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Queluz</ENAMEX>, with imaginative fountains, and armies of statues.
Sintra
Finally, excursions turn inland to the fetching hill <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sintra</ENAMEX>. Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 14th century</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">kings</ENAMEX> have made the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pa√ßo da Vila</ENAMEX>, the royal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> in the center of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> home. 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pal√°cio da Pena</ENAMEX>, crowning a verdant hill overlooking the mountains and coast, is an even more extraordinary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dwelling</ENAMEX>. Built by a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Baron</ENAMEX> for his <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">queen</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1840</TIMEX>, up close it turns out to be an eclectic, whimsical mix of architectural styles (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gothic, Manueline</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moorish</ENAMEX>).
On a nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">hilltop</ENAMEX>, the atmospheric ruins <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Castelo dos Mouros</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moors‚Äô Castle</ENAMEX>) date from the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">eighth</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">ninth</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX>. Its conquest by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Count Afonso Henriques</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1147</TIMEX> was considered a pivotal triumph in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reconquest</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX>.
