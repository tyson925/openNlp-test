the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALGARVE</ENAMEX> andITS <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">People</ENAMEX>
For much of the world, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve</ENAMEX> is synonymous with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX>, yet the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> will tell you the exact opposite: the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> has little in common with the rest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. The southern stretch of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">coast</ENAMEX> is more reminiscent of a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">North African</ENAMEX> landscape than a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> one. It has no cosmopolitan <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>, like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lisbon</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Porto</ENAMEX>, which are farther north. Most of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX> is known for quaint <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX>, medieval castles, and grand <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palaces</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve</ENAMEX> is more recognizable for impenetrable blocks of tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartments</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX>, and meticulously manicured <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">golf courses</ENAMEX>.
And beaches. Think <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Algarve</ENAMEX> and the mind pictures long, glorious stretches of golden <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sands</ENAMEX>, secluded coves framed by odd ochre-colored rock formations, and deep green waters. With <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 160 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100 miles</NUMEX>) of coastline, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Portugalâ</ENAMEX>€™s southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX> is one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Europeâ</ENAMEX>€™s premier beach destinations. The occasionally chilly ocean is the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX>, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve</ENAMEX> has a sultry <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX> feel.
Its consistent climate is the best in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX>, and one of the kindest in the world: <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than 250 days</TIMEX> of sunshine a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">yearÂ â€”Â more</ENAMEX> than almost any other international <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> area. The moderating effect of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gulf Stream</ENAMEX> produces a fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">springtime breeze</ENAMEX> throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX>, and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late January and February</TIMEX>, white almond blossoms blanket the fields. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> the heat is intense but rarely unbearable, and regardless, beautiful beaches and innumerable <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pools</ENAMEX> are always just a dive away.
Magnificent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year-round</TIMEX> weather has made the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve</ENAMEX> a huge destination for sporting vacations. Superb golf <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities aboundÂ â€”Â several</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tees</ENAMEX> dramatically clinging to cliffs and fairways just skirting the edge of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">oceanÂ â€”Â and</ENAMEX> horseback riding, tennis, big-game fishing, sailing, and windsurfing are immensely popular.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sports</ENAMEX>, beaches and hospitable <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">weatherÂ â€”Â not</ENAMEX> to mention easily organized package vacationsÂ â€”Â are surely the reasons the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve</ENAMEX> receives as many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> as the rest of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX> in its entirety. But itâ€™s not just international <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> that descend on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve</ENAMEX>; many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lisbon</ENAMEX> and elsewhere in the north have holiday <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> and spend their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> vacations here.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">coast</ENAMEX> is neatly divided into the rugged <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barlavento</ENAMEX> to the west and the flat beauty of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sotavento</ENAMEX> to the east. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West</ENAMEX> is where youâ€™ll find the famous orange <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">cliffs</ENAMEX> and surreal eroded rock stacks. Near <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cabo de SÃ£o Vicente</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sagres</ENAMEX>, the extreme western point, the terrain is surprisingly barren and the facilities decidedly low-key. The ocean can also be forbiddingly cold.
Tourist resorts clutter the entire middle of the coast, from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lagos</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Faro</ENAMEX>, with a spectrum of homes away from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homeÂ â€”Â monster high-rises</ENAMEX> to low-rider <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">villasÂ â€”Â spilling</ENAMEX> across the rolling hills and lining the beaches. Resorts like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PortimÃ£o</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Albufeira</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vilamoura</ENAMEX> would appear to have little room left to grow, yet tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> seem to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mate</ENAMEX> with each other and reproduce <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">overnight</TIMEX>. Much of the unstoppable growth is crass and frighteningly commercial, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowds</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> unbearable.
The eastern <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve</ENAMEX> is a more sedate marriage of coast and ocean, with warm waters and hot <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sands</ENAMEX> stretching past the wetlands of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ria Formosa</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> border. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarveâ</ENAMEX>€™s most picturesque <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tavira</ENAMEX>, is along this section of the coast.
Away from the coast, the terrain slopes through pines, mimosa, eucalyptus, and heather to an altitude of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly 915</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3,000 ft</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vacationers</ENAMEX> wishing to escape the maddening beach <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowds</ENAMEX> can run for the hills, especially the tantalizing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Serra de Monchique</ENAMEX>.
The regionâ€™s exotic name is derived from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Arabic</ENAMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al-Gharb</ENAMEX>, meaning â€œcountry of the west.â€ The westernmost <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">territory</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> was highly prized by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">North African</ENAMEX> Moors, who occupied it from the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">eighth</NUMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 13th centuries</TIMEX>. Their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">half millennium</TIMEX> here left indelible traces, seen <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> in whitewashed <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">hilltop</ENAMEX> castles, and colorful ceramic tiles.
Following the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reconquest of Iberia</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christians</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve</ENAMEX> led <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX> to glory and fortune. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prince Henry the Navigator</ENAMEX> established his legendary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navigation School</ENAMEX> along <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Portugalâ€™s southern coast</ENAMEX> (financing expeditions with royalties from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve</ENAMEX> fishing industry), and intrepid explorers set out in caravels from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lagos</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sagres</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 15th and 16th centuries</TIMEX>, they ushered in an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Age</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Discovery</ENAMEX>, rounding <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africaâ€™s Cape</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Good Hope</ENAMEX> and eventually reaching <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific</ENAMEX>. Others found their way to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Americas</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brazil</ENAMEX>. Opening world trade <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">routes</ENAMEX> across the globe, they established <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX> as a maritime superpower. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spices</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diamonds</ENAMEX> flowed across the seas to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lisbon</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX> soon lapsed into decline, though, tattered by wars and constitutional crises, and for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two centuries</TIMEX> or more the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve</ENAMEX> remained isolated from the rest of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. Even though the coast received many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">illustrious visitors</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> times through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Middle Ages</TIMEX> and up to the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Edwardian</ENAMEX> period (when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">travelers</ENAMEX> came to luxuriate in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Monchiqueâ</ENAMEX>€™s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">spa</ENAMEX> waters), the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarveâ</ENAMEX>€™s elite vacation status is a relatively recent phenomenon. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> on the coast, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Praia da Rocha</ENAMEX>, was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only â€œdiscoveredâ€</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1930s</TIMEX>, and the real build-up didnâ€™t kick into overdrive until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the beginning of the 1980s</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spainâ€™s Costa del Sol</ENAMEX> developed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> and more rapidly (and some would say, more disastrously). Yet the lessons of rampant, ill-advised development across the border were not heeded. Only recently has environmental and aesthetic consciousness at least mandated that newer developments be limited to low-rises.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">YetÂ â€”Â quite</ENAMEX> remarkably, in the face of the ongoing tourism <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">onslaughtÂ â€”Â parts</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve</ENAMEX> retain their old-fashioned charm. The main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> along the coast, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">EN-125</ENAMEX>, is lined with ceramic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> and stifled with summertime traffic, but the agricultural countryside to the north is a different world. Flowering orchards and gentle grain fields replace <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartments</ENAMEX>, and snack <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bars</ENAMEX>. A slow, rural lifestyle perseveres against the rush of modern life.
For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX>, fishing has been the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarveâ</ENAMEX>€™s lifeblood. Small fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> preserve their simple and unaffected ways, seemingly oblivious to the tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hordes</ENAMEX>. Scrappy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crews</ENAMEX> of small hand-painted <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> troll the waters just offshore, and trawlers <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> deep in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX> for big shoals of bacalhau (cod) so beloved by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX>.
A visit to the local fish market is a revealing window into <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Algarvian</ENAMEX> life. Negotiations are serious but friendly. The same scenario is played out <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a thousand</NUMEX> times a day at markets all across the region; every <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> has a market day at least once a month. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Farmers</ENAMEX> bring their <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">livestock</ENAMEX> to trade, and artisans and itinerant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendors</ENAMEX> sell their wares.
Not a large area, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve</ENAMEX> is relatively easy to get around, whether by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> (an effort that is much more relaxing outside of the main <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer season</TIMEX>). The distances between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mega-resorts</ENAMEX> and unspoiled <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> are surprisingly small.
Besides beaches, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarveâ</ENAMEX>€™s major attractions are <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> that lived through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX> of adventure, triumph, and disaster. Faro, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tavira</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lagos</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> with a strong <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Moorish</ENAMEX> influence, and quiet mountain <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Silves, Alte</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salir</ENAMEX> are reminders of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the days</TIMEX> before golf <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX> and hotel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX>.
Despite the regionâ€™s ancient roots, few historic monuments survive from before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1755</TIMEX>, when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve</ENAMEX> was rocked by a monumental earthquake that took <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of lives and leveled <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> as far north as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lisbon</ENAMEX>. Still, youâ€™ll find vestiges of a vibrant past, including evocative <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle ruins</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX> with extraordinary displays of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> glazed tiles. Even the humblest village has a classic white <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>, a sleepy <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plaza shaded</ENAMEX> by vivid purple <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">jacaranda</ENAMEX>, and, if you time it right, the drama of the local market.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> are famously hospitable, if reserved. And they remain tolerant and helpful, even though they know that their lovely coast is no longer just theirs.
