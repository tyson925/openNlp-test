Where to Go
Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Costa del</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sol</ENAMEX> are based in one of the large coastal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX> to the west of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M√°laga</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Torremolinos, Benalm√°dena</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fuengirola, Marbella</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Estepona</ENAMEX>), while far fewer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> east toward <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nerja, Almu√±√©car</ENAMEX>, or even as far as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Almer√≠a.</ENAMEX> Although the main aim for many is to relax on the beach and soak up as much sun as possible, increasing numbers arrive to play <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">golf</ENAMEX>. It comes as little surprise, therefore, that the road signs proclaim the area west of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M√</ENAMEX>°laga not just the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Costa del</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sol</ENAMEX>, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Costa del Golf</ENAMEX> also.
A few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> forsake the beach for a day or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> and venture out to either the amazingly varied historic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> and cities or the natural wonders of the national <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX> nearby. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M√°laga</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ronda</ENAMEX>, and perhaps <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gibraltar</ENAMEX> can be seen in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a day</TIMEX>, but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sevilla, C√≥rdoba</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Granada</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks necessitate</ENAMEX> at least an overnight stop.
M√°laga
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">M√°laga‚Äôs international</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX> is the gateway to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Costa del</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sol</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Andaluc√</ENAMEX>≠a for most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. However, few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> spend much time in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> itself. This is a shame, as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M√</ENAMEX>°laga is an ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Andaluc√≠an</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of not inconsiderable charm that offers a refreshing taste of the real <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>.
Founded by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phoenician</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> more than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3,000 years ago</TIMEX>, it came under <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carthaginian</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> rule before falling to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Moorish</ENAMEX> invasion force in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">711</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moors</ENAMEX> fortified the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, developing the settlement into a major trading <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX> serving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Granada</ENAMEX>, and it was one of the last <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> to be re-conquered by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1487</TIMEX>.
A good place to begin a tour is at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M√</ENAMEX>°laga‚Äôs principle landmark, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gibralfaro</ENAMEX> (from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Arabic</ENAMEX> Jebel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Faro¬†‚Äî¬†Lighthouse Hill</ENAMEX>). Located <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">some 130 m</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">425 ft</ENAMEX>) above the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, this hilltop is capped by the ramparts of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phoenician</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> reconstructed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 14th century</TIMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moors</ENAMEX> (who went on to build the lighthouse that gave <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gibralfaro</ENAMEX> its name). The restored walls and parapets offer a superb panoramic view of both the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> below and the coastline disappearing into the horizon. Because it looks down on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Plaza de Toros</ENAMEX>, the hill also acts as free seating for bullfights taking place below. Although it is possible to walk here, it is not recommended. Not only is the pathway somewhat difficult in places, it is also a well-known hangout for muggers. Best, then, to take a taxi.
Back at sea level is the delightful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paseo del Parque</ENAMEX>, with contrasting fountains at either end, which connects the old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Plaza de Toros</ENAMEX>. On its south side, it is a lush seaside tropical garden enhanced by fountains, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">duck</ENAMEX> ponds, and small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX>. The other side is home to the smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jard√≠nes Puerta Oscura</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> impressive <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ayuntamiento</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Town Hall</ENAMEX>) and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 18th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">La Aduana</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Old Custom House</ENAMEX>).
Immediately behind here is the sprawling <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alcazaba</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fortress</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace complex</ENAMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moors</ENAMEX> built <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between the 11th and 14th centuries</TIMEX>. A cobbled path climbs up the hillside within the walls to the portal dubbed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arco del Cristo</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Gateway of Christ</ENAMEX>). The victorious <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ferdinand</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isabella</ENAMEX> celebrated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mass</ENAMEX> here when the fortress finally fell into their hands in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1487</TIMEX>. Higher still, the one-time palace (a disappointment compared with those in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Granada</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sevilla</ENAMEX>) contains a small archaeological <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>. Beside the entrance to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alcazaba</ENAMEX> are the partially excavated ruins of a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> theater, the only visible remains of the ancient city.
A short walk away is the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">cathedral</ENAMEX>, known locally as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">La Manquita¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-armed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady¬</ENAMEX>†‚Äî¬†because one of its twin <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">towers</ENAMEX> remains unfinished. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">north</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> soars <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">100 m</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">some 330 ft</NUMEX>) above the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>, but work on the other, a forlorn stump of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stone</ENAMEX>, stopped in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1783</TIMEX> because of a lack of money.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M√°laga</ENAMEX> was the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">birthplace</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pablo Ruiz Picasso</ENAMEX>, though the young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX> left his native <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 14</TIMEX> for the more cosmopolitan climates of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barcelona.</ENAMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> he was born in, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Casa Natal Picasso</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plaza de la Merced</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>, doubles as a small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> and research <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>. On a larger scale is the nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Museo de Bellas Artes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fine Arts Museum</ENAMEX>), an old Renaissance-style <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> with pleasing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patios</ENAMEX>. In late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>, it was being converted into the future <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Museo Picasso</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Picasso Museum</ENAMEX>).
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museo de Artes y Tradiciones Populares</ENAMEX> on the western edge of the old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> is easily missed, but that would be a mistake. Situated in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Posada de la</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Victoria</ENAMEX>, a charming <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 17th-century</TIMEX> historic inn that is incongruous with its surroundings, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> offers a fascinating glimpse of how life was lived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">M√</ENAMEX>°laga in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">generations past</TIMEX>.
On the way back to the center of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M√°laga</ENAMEX>, stop for a moment or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> at the century-old <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mercado Atarazanas</ENAMEX> (market). <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Each morning</TIMEX> it is filled with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> admiring the bountiful displays of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meat</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetables</ENAMEX>, and shopping in the traditional manner for fresh, not plastic-wrapped, produce. This is also the western boundary of a collection of small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX> and pedestrian-only <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> that end at the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calle Marqu√©s de Larios</ENAMEX>, and combine to form <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">M√°laga‚Äôs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principal</ENAMEX> shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>. You can buy almost anything here, from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foodstuffs</ENAMEX> to footwear, but be advised that the siesta still reigns in this part of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> and nothing is open <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between about 2pm and 5pm</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North of M√</ENAMEX>°laga
Just <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">an hour‚Äôs</NUMEX> drive north of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">M√°laga</ENAMEX> lies some magnificent mountain scenery. The national <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">El Torcal de Antequera</ENAMEX> is a high limestone plateau that has been eroded by rainwater into a fantasy landscape of fluted pinnacles and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">towers</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Hikers</ENAMEX> can explore the marked <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">trails</ENAMEX>, which are <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">up to 5 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 miles</NUMEX>) in length and wind among the rocks, and enjoy panoramic views back to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M√°laga</ENAMEX> and the distant blue <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX>. This is where you will also find a most wonderful small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">La Posada del Torcal</ENAMEX>.
Near the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alora</ENAMEX>, you will find the breathtaking gorge known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Garganta del Chorro</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">hundred meters</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,000 feet</NUMEX>) in depth, this sheer-sided canyon is cut by the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Guadalhorce River</ENAMEX>. It is also accessible from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M√</ENAMEX>°laga by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX>; ask for a ticket to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Chorro</ENAMEX>. An improbable concrete catwalk called the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Camino del Rey</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The King‚Äôs Way</ENAMEX>) crosses a vertical cliff and continues into the heart of the gorge, a dizzying <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">65</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">200 ft</ENAMEX>) above the river. It was built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1920s</TIMEX> to provide access for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> digging <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tunnels</ENAMEX> for a hydroelectricity project. The artificial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dams</ENAMEX> above the gorge have created attractive lakes, known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pantanos del Chorro</ENAMEX>. Fringed with woods, sandy beaches, and campsites, they constitute a refreshing change of scenery from the heat and bustle of the coast.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">West of M√</ENAMEX>°laga
Some of the world‚Äôs most popular beach <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX> line the coast that stretches <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">162 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100 miles</NUMEX>) to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rock of Gibraltar</ENAMEX>.
Torremolinos
Just <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a few kilometers</NUMEX> west of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">M√°laga‚Äôs international</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Torremolinos</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 1950s</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 1960s</TIMEX>, it was the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Costa del</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sol</ENAMEX> to establish a reputation as a popular international <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">playground</ENAMEX>. Although little more than an overgrown village, it was a haven for young northern <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Europeans</ENAMEX> seeking an inexpensive vacation with much
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sun</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sand</ENAMEX>, and sangr√≠a. Since then, it has built, quite literally, on that reputation. And although it is nowhere as inexpensive, even relatively, as it once was, it is still a highly popular tourist destination.
Wall-to-wall <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartments</ENAMEX> reach way back from the beaches and there‚Äôs no denying that it delivers everything sun-hungry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vacationers</ENAMEX> could wish for. Its <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">miles</NUMEX> of glorious beaches, guaranteed sun, cheap alcohol and food, numerous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX>, discotheques, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">nightclubs</ENAMEX> attract a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clientele</ENAMEX> that is largely <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX>, although other northern <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> are still well represented here. (Even a fair number of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russians</ENAMEX> are now visiting.) This cosmopolitan, but not by any means sophisticated, international invasion has completely overwhelmed the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>. There can be few places in the world where foreign languages, principally <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, are more dominant than the native language. But that is certainly the case in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Torremolinos</ENAMEX>.
Although the first mention of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> dates back to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1498</TIMEX>, there is really nothing here of historical significance. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> itself, especially <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Calle San Miguel</ENAMEX>, is simply a profusion of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>. At the bottom of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">San Miguel</ENAMEX> a series of winding stairways, lined by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> of course, lead down towards a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">7 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">nearly 5 mile</NUMEX>) sweep of golden coastline. This consists of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> beaches connected by the wonderful <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paseo Maritimo</ENAMEX> (beach promenade) and broken only by the rocky promontory of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Castillo de</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Clara</ENAMEX>, which separates the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bajondillo</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">east</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carihuela</ENAMEX> (west) sections of town.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chiringuitos</ENAMEX> (small beachside <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>) are in plentiful supply, especially in the former fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Carihuela</ENAMEX>. There are still a few bona fide <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fishermen</ENAMEX> about, and if you can manage to drag yourself out of bed <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between six and eight</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX>, you‚Äôll see them returning to shore in their gaily painted, flat-bottomed wooden <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX>, with nets of sardines and anchovies. At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">lunchtime</TIMEX>, you can sample the morning‚Äôs catch, skewered on a wooden stick and grilled over a fire on the beach (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">97</NUMEX>).
Many other popular attractions lie close at hand, including the wave <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pools</ENAMEX> and water slides of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Atlantis Aquapark</ENAMEX>, the horse show at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Club El Rancho</ENAMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 18-hole</TIMEX> course of the nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parador del Golf</ENAMEX>. But the biggest draw in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Torremolinos</ENAMEX> continues to be the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">discos</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clubs</ENAMEX> that have earned the resort its international reputation for non-stop nightlife.
Benalm√°dena-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Costa</ENAMEX>
Heading west it appears, at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> glance, that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Benalm√</ENAMEX>°dena-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Costa</ENAMEX> is indistinguishable from its close <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX>. However, this isn‚Äôt really so. In fact, it is somewhat less built up and frenetic than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Torremolinos</ENAMEX>, even though it is well endowed with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bars</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">discos</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clubs</ENAMEX>. Its fine beaches stretch for <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">9 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">over 5 miles</NUMEX>), beginning at the large and attractive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Puerto Deportivo</ENAMEX> on the border with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Torremolinos</ENAMEX>. Focal points are the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Moorish</ENAMEX> watch <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">towers</ENAMEX>; the pink, neo-Moorish walls of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Castillo El Bil-Bil</ENAMEX>, built by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Frenchwoman</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1930s</TIMEX> and used for concerts, exhibitions, and as a tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>; and one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Costa del Sol‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">casinos</ENAMEX> at the huge and impressive <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Torrequebrada</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>.
A <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">couple of kilometers</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about a mile</NUMEX>) inland and high above the sea lies the village of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Benalm√°dena-Pueblo</ENAMEX>. Its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museo Arqueol√≥gico y de Arte Colombino</ENAMEX> is an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX> of national importance. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> takes pride in its collection of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pre</ENAMEX>-Columbian art (said to be the most important of its kind in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>), with jewelry, statuary, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ceramics</ENAMEX> from all the major cultures. Also in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Benalm√°dena</ENAMEX> area is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T√</ENAMEX>≠voli World amusement <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>, in the suburb of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arroyo de la Miel</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">91</NUMEX>), the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sea Life</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">aquarium</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Puerto Deportivo</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eagle Park</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colomares Castle</ENAMEX>.
Fuengirola
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Nine</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kilometers</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6 miles</NUMEX>) down the line is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fuengirola</ENAMEX>, another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> that‚Äôs hugely popular with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX>. Here, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacon</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> and chips, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">darts</ENAMEX>, snooker, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> beer, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX> showing <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> soccer games are the norm. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fuengirola</ENAMEX> has assimilated this without losing its <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> character. And this is particularly true in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early October</TIMEX> during the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> fair, when the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> becomes a blaze of color and noise, and most every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> dons typical Andaluc√≠an dress. Tradition survives, too, as the commercial fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">fleet</ENAMEX> is an ongoing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plaza de la Constituci√≥n</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town center</ENAMEX> has numerous pleasant caf√©s lining the square beneath the church bell <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX>, and nearby is the bullring and the small <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Zoo Municipal</ENAMEX>. Across the river at the western end of town rise the remains of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Castillo de Sohail</ENAMEX>. Abd-er-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rahman III</ENAMEX> built this hilltop fortress in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 10th century</TIMEX> and gradually a settlement grew up around the walls. Taken by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christians</ENAMEX> in a bloody battle in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1487</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sohail</ENAMEX> was then leveled on the orders of the ‚ÄúCatholic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">kings</ENAMEX>.‚Äù After it was rebuilt, it was occupied by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> during the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Peninsular War</ENAMEX>, who left behind a souvenir of their <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">stay¬†‚Äî¬†the cannons</ENAMEX> that are now displayed along the promenade of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paseo Mar√≠timo.</ENAMEX> Other attractions here include a variety of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> sports, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">marina</ENAMEX>, the fishing harbor, a sailing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>, the waterslides of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Mijas Aqua Park</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Cartujano</ENAMEX> horse show, and horse racing at the newly opened <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mijas Hippodrome</ENAMEX>.
Mijas
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Eight</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kilometers</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 miles</NUMEX>) inland from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fuengirola</ENAMEX> and clinging to the hillside is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mijas</ENAMEX>. Surrounded by modern villas and urbanizaciones (developments), it looks from the outside like any other quaint <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> with whitewashed <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mijas</ENAMEX> is different. Most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> have been converted into upscale <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bars</ENAMEX>, making the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> itself a unique tourist attraction. Traffic is banned from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>, so if you don‚Äôt feel like the short walk from the parking lot, take a mule <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">taxi</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mijas</ENAMEX> has Spain‚Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only square bullring</NUMEX>, and across from it, beautifully tended gardens slope down to a cliff-top <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mirador</ENAMEX>, with fine views all along the coast. There is another mirador beside the car <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>. On <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> side of this natural balcony you will find a tiny chapel dedicated to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Virgen de la Pe√±a</ENAMEX> (Our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lady</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mountain</ENAMEX>), set in a grotto carved from living rock.

Sheltered by the mountains of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sierra Blanca</ENAMEX> on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> side and with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean Sea</ENAMEX> on the other, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marbella</ENAMEX> has earned a reputation for being the most aristocratic of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Costa del Sol‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX>. This began in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1950s</TIMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prince Alfonso von Hohenlohe</ENAMEX> bought land and built himself a luxurious <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> here. It became so popular with his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guests</ENAMEX> that he developed it into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marbella Club Hotel</ENAMEX>, and that in turn launched <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marbella</ENAMEX> as a trendy gathering place for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">jet</ENAMEX> set in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s</TIMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">playground</ENAMEX> for the rich and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">famous</ENAMEX>, frequented by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">celebrities</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">royalty</ENAMEX> and business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tycoons</ENAMEX>. As a consequence, this has seen the further development, both here and along the coast, of the largest collection of luxury <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>. Naturally, then, prices are much higher here than in the other coastal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX>, but you get what you pay for in terms of superior standards of accommodation, service, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cuisine</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marbella</ENAMEX> is certainly a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> parts. The largest, by far, is the modern section and the center of this, clustered around the palm <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> and fountains of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parque de la Alameda</ENAMEX>, is taken up with busy <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sidewalk caf√©s</ENAMEX>, smart <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boutiques</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX>, and real estate agents‚Äô <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>. The construction of a four-lane bypass has happily put an end to the crush of traffic that regularly used to jam this part of town. It is at its most attractive, though, by the sea, where the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">municipality</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marbella</ENAMEX> encompasses some <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">28 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">17 miles</NUMEX>) of beachfront. The promenade winds along the beaches of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Fuerte</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fontanilla</ENAMEX>, passing a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">marina</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Puerto Deportivo</ENAMEX>) with moorings for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several hundred</NUMEX> pleasure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX>, overlooked by the tall <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">spire</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">lighthouse</ENAMEX>. Some lively beach bars and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> make this a popular part of town.
The promenade extends west for <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a mile</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>, between attractive apartment <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> and long stretches of golden <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sands</ENAMEX>. The monuments of modern <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Marbella</ENAMEX> cling to the hills on the western outskirts. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saudi Arabia‚Äôs</ENAMEX> holiday <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">home¬† ‚Äî¬†it</ENAMEX> looks like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">D.C.</ENAMEX>, only slightly larger¬†‚Äî¬† hides behind a row of pines and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">palms</ENAMEX> on a hilltop just above the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">highway</ENAMEX>, surrounded by high security fences. On a neighboring rise stands <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marbella‚</ENAMEX>Äôs modern-style <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mezquita del Rey Abdulaziz Al Saud</ENAMEX>, which is open to the public every <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> except <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX>.
But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marbella</ENAMEX> has its historic side, too. In fact, its history dates back <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 1,600</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, even though most of what can be seen, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> at least, dates from the time of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catholic Monarchs</ENAMEX> and later. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North</ENAMEX> of the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Casco Antiguo</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Old Town</ENAMEX>) provides an intriguing glimpse of the past that has been cleverly integrated to cater to modern <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>. First, sit at a caf√© table in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Plaza de los Naranjos</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Square of the Orange Trees</ENAMEX>), where you can admire the noble <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fa√ßade</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Casa Consistorial</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Town Hall</ENAMEX>) and soak up the atmosphere. Then wander through the maze of narrow, twisting <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> where the whitewashed walls are decorated with colorful baskets of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>.
As you explore the neighborhood, you‚Äôll come across the historic parish <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> with its landmark bell <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX>, and the convents of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Trinidad</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> (it is said that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miguel de Cervantes</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">creator</ENAMEX> of the famous <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Don Quixote</ENAMEX>, lodged at the latter). Uphill from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> lie the crumbling walls of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moorish castillo</ENAMEX>. Scattered throughout this area also are an eclectic array of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">galleries</ENAMEX>.
Other places of interest in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Marbella</ENAMEX> are the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bonsai Museum</ENAMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> and one of the best in the world, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum of Spanish Contemporary Engravings</ENAMEX>. Housed in a structure important in its own right, the latter is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of its kind in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> and has works by <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Picasso</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mir√≥, Tapies</ENAMEX>, and other such famous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX>.
Just outside of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marbella</ENAMEX> are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> other places with ancient historic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">connections</ENAMEX>: the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roman Villa</ENAMEX> mosaics dating from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first and second centuries</TIMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">R√≠o Verde</ENAMEX> near the beach; the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paleo</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">basilica</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vega del Mar</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">San Pedro de Alc√°ntara</ENAMEX>; and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Las Bovedas</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Cellars</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">baths</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guadalmina</ENAMEX>.
With the increasing popularity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marbella</ENAMEX>, high <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">society</ENAMEX> has moved west to the chic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">suburb</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nueva Andaluc√≠a</ENAMEX>, and its magnificent harbor, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Ban√∫s</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sleek</ENAMEX>, unbelievably expensive yachts line the quayside, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bentleys</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Porsches</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rolls Royces</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mercedes</ENAMEX> adorn the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>. There‚Äôs a glamorous line-up of expensive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> and high-class <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boutiques</ENAMEX> that seem to be permanently open. High rollers haunt the tables in the nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Casino Marbella</ENAMEX>, then sip martinis and watch the sun rise from the decks of their luxury yachts. Even if you can‚Äôt quite afford to join in, it‚Äôs fun just to watch how the other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> lives. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">aquarium</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peurto Ban√∫s</ENAMEX> may be small, but it is interesting nonetheless.
This part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Costa del</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sol</ENAMEX> is also a golfer‚Äôs paradise. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>, nearly <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">golf clubs</ENAMEX> were in operation between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M√°laga</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sotogrande</ENAMEX>. These courses cater to all levels, from beginners to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> taking part in the most important competitions in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">golf world‚</ENAMEX>Äôs calendar. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">At least half a dozen</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">quality courses</ENAMEX> can be found between the western edge of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marbella</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">San Pedro de Alc√°ntara</ENAMEX>.
Oj√©n
Inland from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marbella</ENAMEX> lie the high peaks of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sierra Blanca</ENAMEX>, the most distinctive being <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">La Concha</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Seashell</ENAMEX>), which rises directly above the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>. A scenic road leads to the village of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oj√©n</ENAMEX> (famous for its aguardiente, a kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">brandy</ENAMEX> once produced here) and on to the mountain pass called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Puerto de Oj√©n.</ENAMEX> Just beyond, a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> on the left leads to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Refugio de Juanar</ENAMEX>, a hunting lodge set at the heart of a large national game reserve. The peace and tranquility found here has attracted numerous famous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personalities</ENAMEX>. Not least of these is <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">General</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles de Gaulle</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>, who finished his memoirs here in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1970</TIMEX>. This is the haunt of mountain <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">hare</ENAMEX>, partridge, and the ibex (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Capra</ENAMEX> pyrenaica), a wild mountain goat with large horns that is unique to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>.
Estepona
This is the last major <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">resort town</ENAMEX> on the western part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Costa del</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sol</ENAMEX>, and it provides all the vacation essentials¬†‚Äî¬† good beaches, golf <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">marina¬†‚Äî¬†in</ENAMEX> a small-town atmosphere. Low-rise apartment <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">blocks</ENAMEX>, unpretentious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> overlook the palm-lined <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paseo Mar√≠timo</ENAMEX>, a promenade furnished with park benches, flower displays, and a little <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">playground</ENAMEX>.
Originally a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> settlement, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Estepona</ENAMEX> preserves the remains of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moorish</ENAMEX> fortifications and watchtowers, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">an 18th-century</TIMEX> parish <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>, and an expressionistic bullring, a startling piece of modern architecture which is beginning to look rather worse for wear. On either side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> itself, gracious and upscale hotel <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX> are beginning to make an emblematic impression on the coastline.
Beyond <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Estepona</ENAMEX>, development is more sporadic, though there are some luxury <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sotogrande</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Duquesa</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">About 6 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4 miles</NUMEX>) outside of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, a mountain road takes you up to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Casares</ENAMEX>, a spectacular white <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">hilltop</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> clinging precariously to the rugged slopes below its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Moorish fort</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> commands sweeping views of the coast and countryside, and on a clear day the eye is inevitably drawn to the twin peaks flanking the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Strait of Gibraltar¬†‚Äî¬†the Rock of Gibraltar</ENAMEX> on the right, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morocco‚Äôs Jebel Musa</ENAMEX> on the left. These were known to the ancients as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pillars of Hercules</ENAMEX>, and in ancient times marked the limits of the known world.
Toward <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gibraltar</ENAMEX>
Gibraltar looms ever larger as you approach <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Roque</ENAMEX>, which was established by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">refugees</ENAMEX> who fled the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rock</ENAMEX> when the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> captured it in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1704</TIMEX>. Building <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">blocks</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> were found, conveniently, in the nearby ruins of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman Carteya</ENAMEX>; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, though, little remains of the classical site. Branch off the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-340</ENAMEX> here and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La L√≠nea de la Concepci√≥n</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Rock</ENAMEX> itself. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La L√≠nea</ENAMEX> has experienced a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mini-</ENAMEX>boom since the border with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gibraltar</ENAMEX> was re-opened in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1985</TIMEX> after a blockade lasting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16 years</TIMEX>, but is still a dreary place.
It has been ascertained that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gibraltar</ENAMEX> was a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> for pre-historic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Neanderthal</ENAMEX> skulls were found in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1848 and 1928</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gibraltar</ENAMEX> is considered one of the final bastions for this <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>. Although it is known that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phoenicians</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greeks</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carthaginians</ENAMEX> were aware of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gibraltar</ENAMEX>, and that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Romans</ENAMEX> ruled here from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 500 b.c. to a.d. 475</NUMEX>, no <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> was ever built. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Visigoths</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Vandals</ENAMEX> destroyed almost all traces of culture in the area, and it wasn‚Äôt until after the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moors</ENAMEX> invaded, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">711</TIMEX>, that the first <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> was constructed. However, even that wasn‚Äôt until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nearly 450 years later in 1160</TIMEX>.
The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next three centuries</TIMEX> saw numerous battles, and it wasn‚Äôt until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1462</TIMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gibraltar</ENAMEX> was finally re-conquered by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 18th century</TIMEX>, problems over succession to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> throne led to an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Anglo-Dutch</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> capturing <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gibraltar</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1704</TIMEX>. That led in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1713</TIMEX> to the treaty of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Utrecht</ENAMEX> under which <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> ceded its rights to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gibraltar</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX>. However, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> didn‚Äôt give up without a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fight¬†‚Äî¬†more</ENAMEX> than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>, actually. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1727</TIMEX>, they failed in a siege, and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1779</TIMEX> combined <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> totaling <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50,000</NUMEX> laid the final <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Great Siege</ENAMEX> against <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">just 5,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defenders</ENAMEX>. After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four years</TIMEX> of much hardship, the siege ended in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1783</TIMEX>. It wasn‚Äôt until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1830</TIMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gibraltar</ENAMEX> achieved the status of a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> crown <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX>, which it holds to this day.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">harbor</ENAMEX> lie on the east slope <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">of the Rock</ENAMEX>, overlooking the bay, with the narrow defile of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Main Street</ENAMEX> cutting through the middle. This is lined with duty-free <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> selling <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liquor</ENAMEX>, perfume, cameras, CD <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX>, video recorders, and electronic goods and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX>-style <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pubs</ENAMEX> serving <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">pints</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beer</ENAMEX> and bar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lunches</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> of currency is the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Gibraltarian</ENAMEX> pound (equal to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> pound), but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX> accept <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">pounds sterling and pesetas</NUMEX> as well.
Also at sea level is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gibraltar Museum</ENAMEX>, housed in a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> containing what are considered the best preserved <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moorish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">baths</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> has interesting exhibits on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gibraltar‚</ENAMEX>Äôs history. Of interest, too, is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nelson‚Äôs Anchorage</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Admiral Nelson‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> is said to have been brought in a barrel of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rum</ENAMEX> after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Battle of Trafalgar</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21 October 1805</TIMEX>, and the nearby <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100-ton</NUMEX> Victorian <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">super-gun</ENAMEX>, the largest <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">gun</ENAMEX> of its type in the world.
Main Street <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ends</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Referendum Gates</ENAMEX>. Beyond lies the cable-car <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX>, where you can take a trip to the top of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Rock</ENAMEX> with a stop halfway to visit the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apes‚Äô Den</ENAMEX>. The tail-less Barbary apes that inhabit the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Rock</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">natives</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Africa</ENAMEX>, descended from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkeys</ENAMEX> brought over by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sailors</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pets</ENAMEX> and ships‚Äô mascots. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Legend</ENAMEX> has it that if the apes ever leave the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Rock</ENAMEX>, then <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> rule will come to an end. When the apes‚Äô <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> declined significantly during <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Winston Churchill</ENAMEX> himself was worried, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkeys</ENAMEX> have been on special rations ever since. The views from the summit <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">426 m</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">396 ft</ENAMEX>) up are spectacular, particularly across the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">strait</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Morocco</ENAMEX>, along the coast toward <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Estepona</ENAMEX>, and down the sheer east face of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Rock</ENAMEX> to the water holding areas (for desalination) and the beaches of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sandy Bay</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catalan Bay</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Eastern Beach</ENAMEX>.
Whether you‚Äôre traveling in your own <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> or in an official <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">taxi</ENAMEX> or minivan, don‚Äôt leave <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gibraltar</ENAMEX> without taking a tour of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Upper Rock Nature Reserve</ENAMEX> area. On the way up note the yellow patches and their accompanying metal rings; these were used when manually hauling the heavy cannons up the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Rock</ENAMEX>. Also of interest is the fact that there is no soil on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Upper Rock</ENAMEX>; the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">600</NUMEX> species of wildflower here grow directly out of the limestone from which the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Rock</ENAMEX> is formed.
First stop is <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Saint Michael‚Äôs Cave</ENAMEX>, an impressive natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">grotto</ENAMEX> that is sometimes used as a venue for musical performances. Then stop to see the apes, and at the north end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Rock</ENAMEX>, take time to explore the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Upper Galleries</ENAMEX>. These are a system of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tunnels</ENAMEX> blasted through the inside of the rock face during the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Great Siege</ENAMEX> of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late 18th century</TIMEX>. Note that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cannon</ENAMEX> emplacements slope downward, a clever innovation that allowed the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defenders</ENAMEX> to fire directly at the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> forces attacking from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">La Linea</ENAMEX>. What cannot be seen is the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">51 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">32 miles</NUMEX>) of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tunnels</ENAMEX> that were excavated during <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX>, and it is from these that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">General</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eisenhower</ENAMEX> conducted the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Allied</ENAMEX> invasion of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North Africa</ENAMEX>. On the way back to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> lies the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moorish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX>, which apart from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">its 14th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> is of little interest.
Algeciras
Just across the bay from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gibraltar</ENAMEX> is an uninspiring port <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> whose only saving grace, on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">good days</TIMEX> at least, is its unsurpassed views of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gibraltar</ENAMEX>. From the harbor, hydrofoils and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car ferries</ENAMEX> cross the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">strait</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ceuta</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> protectorate, and to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tangier</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Morocco</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A day</TIMEX> trip to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ceuta</ENAMEX> is certainly possible, but there is not much, beyond shopping, of interest there. Much more interesting and exciting is to continue on <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 25 miles</NUMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tetuan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Morocco</ENAMEX>, parts of which seem to have remained unchanged for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX>. Because of the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two-hour</TIMEX> time difference between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ceuta</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Morocco</ENAMEX>, it‚Äôs difficult, but possible, to see in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX>. Therefore, an overnight stop in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ceuta</ENAMEX> is recommended. For additional information, see the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Berlitz Travel Guide</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Morocco</ENAMEX>.
Tarifa
This is where the waters of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX> mingle with those of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX>, and bring the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Costa del</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sol</ENAMEX> to an end. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> looks across the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Strait of Gibraltar</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX>, with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rif Mountains</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Morocco</ENAMEX> dominating the horizon <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a mere 13 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">8 miles</NUMEX>) away. A section of the old Moorish walls remains, as does <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 10th century</TIMEX> fortress. However, it is not its history that attracts most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these days</TIMEX>. The beaches stretching to the west are a mecca for windsurfers. The prevailing wind, known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Poniente</ENAMEX>, is from the west, making the beaches among the windiest in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>.
The windsurfers are not the only ones to take advantage of the reliable breeze; the hillsides above the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> have sprouted a veritable forest of wind-powered electricity generators. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">spring</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">autumn</TIMEX>, storks, buzzards, and other soaring birds fill the skies as they climb in the rising thermals before gliding across the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">strait</ENAMEX> on their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> migration, congregating here where the sea crossing is at its shortest.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East of M√</ENAMEX>°laga
The eastern part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Costa del</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sol</ENAMEX> stretches for <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">more than 200 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">125 miles</NUMEX>) from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M√</ENAMEX>°laga to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Almer√≠a.</ENAMEX> This part of the coast has a different feel from the western <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">section</ENAMEX>, with less intensive development and, in parts, a much rockier and attractive shoreline.
M√°laga to Nerja
Leaving the suburbs of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M√°laga</ENAMEX>, you arrive immediately in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rinc√≥n de la</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Victoria</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> largely given over to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekend</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartments</ENAMEX> owned by the local city <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dwellers</ENAMEX>. But prehistoric <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> was here <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, occupying a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cave on the M√</ENAMEX>°laga side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cueva del Tesoro</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Treasure Cave</ENAMEX>). Cave paintings and prehistoric remains, including a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrine</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">goddess</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noctiluca</ENAMEX>, have been found and there is a beautiful underground lake with stalactites. According to legend, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Moorish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">kings</ENAMEX> buried a huge treasure inside the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">cave</ENAMEX>, but it has never been found.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Torre del Mar</ENAMEX> is the gateway to the wine and raisin-producing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Axarqu√≠a</ENAMEX>, and its capital, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">V√©lez-M√°laga</ENAMEX>, which lies <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 1/2 miles</NUMEX>) inland. Founded by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phoenicians, V√</ENAMEX>©lez sprawls around a historic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> dominated by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moorish</ENAMEX> alcazaba and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> venerable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX>: the late-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gothic Iglesia de San Juan Bautista</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iglesia de Santa Mar√≠a</ENAMEX> (which incorporates a section of the town‚Äôs former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX>).
In the village of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Torrox</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Costa</ENAMEX>, as elsewhere on the eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Costa</ENAMEX>, self-catering accommodations predominate over <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX>. Once dedicated to fishing and agriculture, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Torrox</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Costa</ENAMEX> is now an expanding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> with extensive <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> ruins.
Nerja
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nerja</ENAMEX> is the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> large international <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> to the east of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M√°laga</ENAMEX>, and it‚Äôs a popular destination for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Scandinavian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vacationers</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> is smaller than the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">resort towns</ENAMEX> in the west, and despite the intensive development in the hills surrounding it, has also managed to retain some of its village atmosphere. The nightlife is lively, though quieter than in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Torremolinos</ENAMEX>, and the beaches are prettier, if smaller. (They‚Äôre tucked into rocky coves.)
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">area</ENAMEX> also offers good opportunities for hiking, horseback riding, scuba diving, snorkeling, and angling, giving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nerja</ENAMEX> the edge for those seeking a more active vacation.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hotels</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> cluster around the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Balc√≥n de Europa</ENAMEX>, a palm-fringed cliff-top promenade jutting out over the sea, dividing the sandy crescent of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">La Caletilla</ENAMEX> beach on the west from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">La Calahonda</ENAMEX> on the east.
Just <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4 miles</NUMEX>) east of the beach of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maro</ENAMEX> is the famous <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cueva de Nerja</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Cave of Nerja</ENAMEX>). This huge cavern was discovered in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1959</TIMEX> when a group of local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> stumbled on it <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX> while they were out hunting <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bats</ENAMEX>. Floodlights illuminate the impressive limestone formations, including a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stalagmite</ENAMEX>/stalactite over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32 m</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">105 ft</ENAMEX>) high and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">18 m</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">59</NUMEX> ft) in diameter. On display are archaeological remains confirming that these caves were inhabited <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30,000 years ago</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Nerja Festival</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Music and Dance</ENAMEX>, held in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early July</TIMEX>, takes place in the acoustically acclaimed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sala de la Cascada</ENAMEX>. Nearby a rather attractive <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">aqueduct stands</ENAMEX> as testimony to the creative skills of the region‚Äôs earlier <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX>.
Inland from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nerja</ENAMEX>, the corrugated hills of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sierra de Tejeda</ENAMEX> rise up toward the village of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Frigiliana</ENAMEX>. Under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moors</ENAMEX>, it was one of the many prosperous <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> within the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kingdom of Granada</ENAMEX>. Today, the historic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> is regarded as one of the most outstanding examples of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moorish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> architecture on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Costa del</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sol</ENAMEX>, with a lovely <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> and ruined <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moorish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Far East</ENAMEX>
After <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nerja</ENAMEX>, the scenery changes dramatically; the mountains begin to cascade to the sea and the panoramas of the ragged coastline are magnificent. Just before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Herradura</ENAMEX>, a rather neat little <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> with a nice beach, road signs proclaim that you are now in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Provincia de Granada</ENAMEX>. Until you pass into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Almer√≠a</ENAMEX>, this part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Costa del</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sol</ENAMEX>, the most attractive but least known, is now officially called the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Costa Tropical</ENAMEX>.
Almu√±√©car is the first <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of any size, and has an ancient history. A fine <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">aqueduct stands</ENAMEX> as a monument to the skills of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineers</ENAMEX> who constructed it during the reign of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Antoninus Pius</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the second century</TIMEX> a.d. A <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Granada</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moorish</ENAMEX> times, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Almu√±√©car</ENAMEX> continued to enjoy a certain prestige after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reconquest</ENAMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Juan de Herrera</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Escorial</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philip II‚</ENAMEX>Äôs grand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monastery</ENAMEX> cum <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX>, was commissioned to design the parish <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">These days</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, set around an attractive curving beach, is an increasingly popular family <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX>.
Along the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Almu√±√©car</ENAMEX>, pretty villas with spectacular coastal views dot the hillsides until, all of a sudden, the scenery changes dramatically. As the coast flattens out, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of whitewashed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> atop a rocky, cone-shaped hill comes into view. Called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salobre√±a</ENAMEX>, it makes for an impressive sight. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moorish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX>, beautifully restored, stands isolated at the heart of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salobre√±a</ENAMEX> stands as the gateway to the agriculturally rich vega (plain) of the thriving port <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Motril</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sugarcane</ENAMEX>, the source of the greenery, flourishes here. The sugar <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">refineries</ENAMEX> in the area have earned the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> its nickname¬†‚Äî¬†Little <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX>. Like that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Motril</ENAMEX> is known for its <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rum</ENAMEX>, although its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> are crafty enough to make just about enough for local consumption, and no more. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Motril</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salobre√±a</ENAMEX> have their own extensive beaches and there are many more to come as the road continues eastward.
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">The next 40 km</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">25 miles</NUMEX>) is a conservation area and the least developed of any section of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Costa del</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sol</ENAMEX>. The small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX>, reminiscent of what the rest of the coastline used to be like before the mass tourist invasion, have a very limited supply of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX>, which means that even in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">midsummer</TIMEX>, the beaches are far from overcrowded. What‚Äôs more, it‚Äôs possible to be swimming in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX> while the snow-covered peaks of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sierra Nevada</ENAMEX> shimmer in the distance.
This scenery changes, and much for the worse, after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adra</ENAMEX>, an important fishing and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> processing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-340</ENAMEX> crosses a vast and dreary plain where every available piece of level land has been covered by ugly plastic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">greenhouses</ENAMEX> that produce much of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Europe‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetables</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> rejoins the coast at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aguadulce</ENAMEX> where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX>, mainly <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX>, enjoy good beaches, new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">golf courses</ENAMEX>, and marinas. Here, the mountains meet the sea again, and the journey onto <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Almer√</ENAMEX>≠a is short but attractive.
Almer√≠a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rich</ENAMEX> in history, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Almer√≠a</ENAMEX> was once the most important <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moorish Spain</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Almer√</ENAMEX>≠a of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> is a pleasant provincial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> that‚Äôs worth a visit if your travels take you to the eastern limits of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Costa del</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sol</ENAMEX>.
There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> major sights. Abd-er-Rahman III‚Äôs massive Alcazaba looms large on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">hilltop</ENAMEX> above the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. Although an earthquake caused extensive damage in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1522</TIMEX>, the crenellated ocher outer walls and a section of the turreted ramparts stand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX>, providing wide-ranging vistas over the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> and the sea. And the forbidding, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fortified cathedral</ENAMEX> that stands just inland from the waterfront <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paseo de Almer√≠a</ENAMEX> was built during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16th century</TIMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barbary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pirates</ENAMEX> were terrorizing the coast (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>).
Inland from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Almer√≠a</ENAMEX> lies one of the most un-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> landscapes on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> continent. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sierra de Alhamilla</ENAMEX> is a desert of barren mountains, rocky ravines, and dry <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gravel riverbeds</ENAMEX>; spiky agave <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> and prickly <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">pears</ENAMEX> are the only vegetation. The region‚Äôs uncanny resemblance to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American West</ENAMEX> made it a popular film location for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spaghetti westerns</ENAMEX>, including such classics as <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A Fistful of Dollars and The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly</ENAMEX>, which set a young <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clint Eastwood</ENAMEX> on the road to stardom in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX>. Near the village of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tabernas</ENAMEX> is an area known as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mini</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX>, where <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> spaghetti-western <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">film</ENAMEX> sets have been preserved as tourist attractions, complete with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cowboys</ENAMEX>, and barroom brawls.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inland Excursions</ENAMEX>
For a complete contrast to the sun, sea, and sangr√≠a atmosphere of the coast, you need only drive inland for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a few hours</TIMEX> to reach the cultural, historical, and architectural attractions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ronda, Jerez de la Frontera, Sevilla, C√≥rdoba</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Granada¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†the great <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Andaluc√≠a.</ENAMEX> If your time is limited, try one of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> trips offered in all the major <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX> or focus your attention on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ronda</ENAMEX>. Most of the other destinations require an overnight stay.
Ronda
The opening of an improved <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">San</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pedro de Alc√</ENAMEX>°ntara to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ronda</ENAMEX> has ended the isolation of this mountain area, and shortened the driving time from the coast to an hour. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the most spectacularly situated <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronda</ENAMEX> sits atop a cliff-bound plateau, cleaved through the middle by a sheer-sided gorge. The older, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moorish</ENAMEX> part of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Ciudad</ENAMEX>) lies to the south of the ravine, linked by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">an 18th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Mercadillo</ENAMEX>, the modern district that arose after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reconquista</ENAMEX>.
The gorge, known as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Tajo</ENAMEX>, is a deep and narrow crevasse that plunges <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">150 m</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">490 ft</ENAMEX>) to the foaming <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">R√≠o Guadalev√≠n</ENAMEX>, a tributary of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Guadiaro River</ENAMEX>. During <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the Civil War</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nationalist sympathizers</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> were hurled to their deaths in the gorge, an event recalled by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hemingway</ENAMEX> in his novel <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">For Whom the Bell Tolls</ENAMEX>. You can enjoy a superb view of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tajo</ENAMEX> and the patchwork of fields beyond from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puente Nuevo</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">New Bridge</ENAMEX>), built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1788</TIMEX>, as well as from the walkways that follow the edge of the gorge.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cross</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX> into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ciudad</ENAMEX>, the old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moorish</ENAMEX> enclave which remained impervious to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> assault until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1485</TIMEX>, to see most of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ronda‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most important monuments. On <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Plaza de Campillo</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square stands</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palacio de Mondrag√≥n</ENAMEX>, constructed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abomelic</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">King of Ronda</ENAMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1314</TIMEX> and later taken over by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conquerors</ENAMEX>. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> portal, a distinguished later addition, opens onto spacious <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyards</ENAMEX> where horseshoe arches, <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Arabic</ENAMEX> inscriptions, and distinctive tile ornaments indicate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moorish</ENAMEX> origins of this grand <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">block</ENAMEX> or so away, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ronda‚</ENAMEX>Äôs original <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX> survives in the form of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Church of Santa Mar√</ENAMEX>≠a la <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mayor</ENAMEX>. The minaret was converted into a bell <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX>, and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gothic</ENAMEX> nave was tacked on to the original structure, followed by a high altar in ornate <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Plateresque</ENAMEX> style, and some finely carved <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Baroque choir</ENAMEX> stalls. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> overlooks the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plaza de la Duquesa de Parcent</ENAMEX>, the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>, with the long, elegant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fa√ßade</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ayuntamiento</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Town Hall</ENAMEX>) gracing another side.
Heading back toward the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puente Nuevo</ENAMEX>, stop to view the exterior of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palacio del Marqu√©s de Salvatierra</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">an 18th-century Renaissance</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansion</ENAMEX> famous for its wrought-iron <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">balconies</ENAMEX> made in the traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Ronda</ENAMEX> style. Note, also, the carved stone figures above the entrance. Nearby stands <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">La Casa del Rey Moro</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Moorish King‚Äôs House</ENAMEX>), which is a curious combination of the water <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mine</ENAMEX> and gardens designed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">landscaper</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jean Claude Nicolas Forestier</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1920s</TIMEX>. Beyond here the road curves down toward the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tajo</ENAMEX>, where <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> more bridges¬†‚Äî¬†the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puente Viejo</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Old Bridge</ENAMEX>) built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1616</TIMEX> on top of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> foundations and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Moorish Puente Arabe¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†span the gorge and offer striking views of the chasm. Down by the river stands the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ba√±os √Årabes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moorish Baths</ENAMEX>), with the vaulted roof still intact.
Immediately back across the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puente Nuevo</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Parador</ENAMEX> hotel occupies what was the old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Town Hall</ENAMEX>, and just beyond that is <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Ronda‚Äôs Neoclassical Plaza de Toros</ENAMEX>, one of the oldest bullrings in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>. Inaugurated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1785</TIMEX>, it is regarded as the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">birthplace</ENAMEX> of the modern bullfight, and is something of a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrine</ENAMEX> to aficionados of the corrida. It has a small, but very interesting, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> below the arcaded arena.

The ancient city of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C√°diz</ENAMEX>, sitting at the end of a very narrow peninsula of land that runs parallel to the coast, was founded by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phoenicians</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1100</TIMEX> b.c. and is considered to be <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spain‚</ENAMEX>Äôs oldest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>. In fact, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C√</ENAMEX>°diz‚Äôs amazing amalgam of history is not readily apparent, with only the remains of the old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roman Theater</ENAMEX> to give much evidence of the city‚Äôs age. It was re-conquered by <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Alfonso X</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1262</TIMEX> and granted the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monopoly of Trade</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catholic Monarchs</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1493</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbus</ENAMEX> also departed from this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">his second and fourth voyages</TIMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1493 and 1502</TIMEX>, respectively. In the latter part of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16th century</TIMEX>, it twice came under attack by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enemy</ENAMEX> naval <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX>, and a period of prosperity ensued when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Casa de Contrataci√≥n</ENAMEX>, or the monopoly rights for trade with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Americas</ENAMEX>, was transferred from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sevilla</ENAMEX> by order of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Felipe V</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1717</TIMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A century</TIMEX> later on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19 March 1812</TIMEX>, while under attack from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Napoleon‚Äôs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX>, the national <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parliament</ENAMEX> met in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Felipe Neri Church</ENAMEX> and proclaimed the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parliament</ENAMEX>.
Of most interest in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> today is the architecturally contrasting <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Baroque and Classical cathedral</ENAMEX>, which was constructed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1772 and 1838</TIMEX>. The elegant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hospital de Mujeres</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Women‚Äôs Hospital</ENAMEX>), built even earlier in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1749</TIMEX>, is notable for its patio and art collection, including a fine <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Greco</ENAMEX>. The curious and unusual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oratorio de la Santa Cueva</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Church of Santa Cueva</ENAMEX>) has original underground <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chapels</ENAMEX> dating from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1783</TIMEX>. Of more interest is the domed upper chapel added in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1796</TIMEX>, whose ceiling is adorned by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">spectacular paintings¬†‚Äî¬†three</ENAMEX> of which are fine examples of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goya‚</ENAMEX>Äôs work. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Felipe Neri Church</ENAMEX>, mentioned above, is also well worth a look. Built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1679</TIMEX>, it has towering columns and an unusual elliptical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dome</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Puerto de Santa Mar√</ENAMEX>≠a
This small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, on the coast of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bay of C√°diz</ENAMEX>, looks across to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of the same name and has considerable charm. It is generally overlooked by foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> flock here in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX>, especially during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August</TIMEX>. Then, when there are a series of bullfights, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seafood</ENAMEX> and shellfish <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> for which <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Puerto</ENAMEX> is famous are full to overflowing until <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the early hours</TIMEX>. In fact, there isn‚Äôt too much to see here, but that‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">okay¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†El <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto de Santa Mar√</ENAMEX>≠a is one of those places that is to be savored for its ambience. Positioned between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jerez de la Frontera</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C√°diz</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Puerto</ENAMEX> is easily reached by <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> or rail. However, the most delightful way to get here is on the small ferryboat, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Adriano</ENAMEX>, which plies its way between the center of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C√°diz</ENAMEX> and the dockside in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Puerto</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerez de la Frontera</ENAMEX>
The name of this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> is indicative of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> things. It once lay close to the frontier of the old <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Moorish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">kingdom</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Granada</ENAMEX>, hence <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de la Frontera</ENAMEX>. And <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerez</ENAMEX> (pronounced <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">khay-reth</ENAMEX>) gave its name to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> that has made the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> famous, better known to the world in its anglicized <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">version¬†‚Äî¬†sherry</ENAMEX>.
Although known as long ago as the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Phoenician</ENAMEX> era, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerez</ENAMEX> first came to prominence under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moors</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 11th and 12th centuries</TIMEX>, and it is from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that period</TIMEX> that the impressively walled and towered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alc√</ENAMEX>°zar dates. Inside is a simple but elegant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX> that was later converted into a chapel dedicated to <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Santa Mar√≠a la Real</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Re</ENAMEX>-conquered by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alfonso X</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1264</TIMEX>, it became one of the most prosperous <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Andaluc√≠a</ENAMEX> after the discovery of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Americas</ENAMEX> and the reunification of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1492</TIMEX>.
Below the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alc√°zar</ENAMEX> lies the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colegiata</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Collegiate Church</ENAMEX>), a towering dark stone cathedral dating from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th</TIMEX> to 18th <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX>. Housed within is the precious image of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cristo de la Vi√±a</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christ</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Vineyard</ENAMEX>). It was the development of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sherry wine</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">brandy</ENAMEX> business that brought the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> worldwide acclaim and more prosperity. It is impossible to walk the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> without recognizing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bodegas</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wineries</ENAMEX>) of prestigious old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harvey</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Williams & Humbert</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gonzalez-Byass</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pedro Domecq</ENAMEX>. As some of the names imply, it was a group of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">merchants</ENAMEX> who launched <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jerez</ENAMEX> as the world capital of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fortified wine</ENAMEX>.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Three centuries</TIMEX> on, their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">descendants</ENAMEX> continue to control the sherry trade. All the larger <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> offer tours of their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bodegas</ENAMEX>, mostly on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">mornings</TIMEX>, and some require you to reserve in advance. Traditional hospitality means of course that every tour ends with a tasting session.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jerez</ENAMEX> is also famous for its <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX>. The sherry-producing aristocracy built vast <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ranches</ENAMEX> alongside the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">vineyards</ENAMEX>, which provided an ideal environment for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horse</ENAMEX> breeding. And the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Domecq</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> established the world-famous Real <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Escuela Andaluza del Arte Ecuestre</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Andaluc√≠an Riding School</ENAMEX>) in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1973</TIMEX> as a showcase for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Andaluc√</ENAMEX>≠an equestrian skills. The school‚Äôs <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> dressage exhibitions are a must-see, and the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Horse Fair</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early May</TIMEX> is a colorful event.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jerez</ENAMEX> has more subtle attractions also. In addition to the expected numerous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palaces</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansions</ENAMEX>, look especially for the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Andaluc√≠an Flamenco Center</ENAMEX> in the distinguished <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Pemart√≠n Palace</ENAMEX> and the striking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clock Museum</ENAMEX> in its own delightful gardens.
Sevilla
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Andaluc√≠a</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sevilla</ENAMEX> is the most <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the most beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> in the world, it has a sensual, spiritual, and romantic ambience.
It was already a thriving riverside settlement when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Julius Caesar</ENAMEX> arrived in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">45 b.c.</TIMEX>, and under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Romans</ENAMEX>, it developed into a major <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>. In fact, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> emperors, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hadrian</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trajan</ENAMEX>, were born in nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">It√°lica</ENAMEX>. Subsequently, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sevilla</ENAMEX> became the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Visigothic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">kingdom</ENAMEX> and then of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moorish</ENAMEX> taifa, before falling to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferdinand III</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1248</TIMEX>. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monopoly</ENAMEX> of trade with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New World</ENAMEX> brought the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> to its peak during the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golden Age</ENAMEX>. ‚ÄúMadrid is the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>,‚Äù the saying went, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äúbut Sevilla</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> of the world.‚Äù
The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> most prominent monuments in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> are located around the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plaza del Triunfo</ENAMEX>. Work on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">cathedral</ENAMEX>, the largest <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Gothic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> in the world and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> largest of its <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">kind¬†‚Äî¬†only St. Peter‚Äôs</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Paul‚</ENAMEX>Äôs in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bigger¬†‚Äî¬†began</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1401</TIMEX> after the great <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX> was razed. The new building followed the ground plan of the old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX>, accounting for its unusually broad, rectangular form.
Massive without, and richly decorated within, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cathedral</ENAMEX> contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 30</NUMEX> chapels, including the central <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Capilla</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mayor</ENAMEX> with its <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Flemish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">altarpiece</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Capilla Real</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Chapel</ENAMEX>), last resting place of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferdinand III</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">‚ÄúKing-Saint‚</ENAMEX>Äù who delivered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sevilla</ENAMEX> from the hands of the infidel. The silver-gilt key to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, presented to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferdinand by the vanquished Moors</ENAMEX>, may be seen in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">treasury</ENAMEX>, along with a cross made from the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> gold brought back by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cristobal Col√≥n</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Christopher Columbus</ENAMEX>) from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New World</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Great Navigator</ENAMEX> himself is interred nearby, in the ornate <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19th-century</TIMEX> sarcophagus by the south entrance. His <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">remains</ENAMEX> were transferred to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sevilla</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Havana</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1898</TIMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX> won its independence from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>.
On the north side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">cathedral</ENAMEX> lies the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Patio de los Naranjos</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Court of the Orange Trees</ENAMEX>), the ceremonial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX> of the old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX> with its original ablutions fountains. The minaret, dating from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1184</TIMEX>, was preserved as the bell <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">cathedral</ENAMEX>; this celebrated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giralda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sevilla‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most famous landmark. The exterior is beautifully decorated with typical sebka design work. It contrasts vividly with the bland interior, where a series of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> gently elevating ramps lead to an observation <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platform</ENAMEX> at a height of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">230 ft</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferdinand III</ENAMEX> rode his <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horse</ENAMEX> to the top following the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reconquista</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1248</TIMEX>.
This is the finest mirador in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sevilla</ENAMEX>, and provides for unparalleled views of the old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> below. It is surprising to note just how large the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Plaza de Toros</ENAMEX> is when seen at this angle. Look up and you will see how the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> came by its name. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1356</TIMEX>, an earthquake destroyed the original ornamental top. And it wasn‚Äôt until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1558</TIMEX> that the addition of the huge bells and a weather vane (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giralda</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish</ENAMEX>) in the form of a statue of a beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">goddess</ENAMEX> representing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Faith</ENAMEX>, raised the height to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">98</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">322 ft</ENAMEX>).
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alc√°zar</ENAMEX> (entrance on far side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>, through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Puerta del Le√≥n</ENAMEX>) is a major monument to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-14th century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mud√</ENAMEX>©jar architecture, combining <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moorish, Gothic</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> elements. Built by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moorish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">craftsmen</ENAMEX> under <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> rule, during the reign of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pedro the Cruel</ENAMEX>, the rambling palace and its several courtyards incorporate fragments of an earlier <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moorish</ENAMEX> fortress, and blend <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> motifs with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moorish</ENAMEX> designs. A visit begins with a tour of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cuarto del Almirante</ENAMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Admiral‚Äôs Apartments</ENAMEX>), where a painting of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Virgen de los Mareantes</ENAMEX> (Virgin of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mariners</ENAMEX>) in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">chapel</ENAMEX> shows <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Columbus</ENAMEX> sheltered beneath the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Virgin‚</ENAMEX>Äôs cloak. The most interesting part is the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Patio de las Doncellas</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Courtyard of the Maidens</ENAMEX>), where the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> preserve outstanding decorative <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">features¬†‚Äî¬†ornamental tiles</ENAMEX>, carved stucco, and characteristic coffered artesonado ceilings.
The ornate, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">domed</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sal√≥n de Embajadores</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hall of the Ambassadors</ENAMEX>) is equal to anything in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alhambra</ENAMEX>. Next door is the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">glass-roofed</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Patio de las Mu√±ecas</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Courtyard of the Dolls</ENAMEX>), so named for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> tiny human faces carved into the decoration surrounding one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moorish</ENAMEX> arches. These are very unusual as <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crafts- men</ENAMEX> were forbidden by their religion to depict the human form in their art.
Returning to the entrance <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX>, take the narrow passage on the right to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Patio de Maria Padilla</ENAMEX>, which sits on top of underground <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">baths</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartments</ENAMEX> beyond are hung with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Flemish</ENAMEX> tapestries recording <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles V‚Äôs Tunis Expedition</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1535</TIMEX>, one of them showing an upside-down map of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX>. Not to be missed, either, are the extensive and beautiful gardens, an oasis of tranquillity in this perpetually busy <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nestled</ENAMEX> around the walls of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alcazar</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barrio de Santa Cruz</ENAMEX>, the old <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Jewish quarter</TIMEX>, a picturesque maze of whitewashed <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>, narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX>, and tiny shaded patios that invite leisurely exploration. Just south of the cathedral stands the former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> building, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Casa Lonja</ENAMEX>, which is now the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Archivo de Indias</ENAMEX>. The unusual <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cuban</ENAMEX> wooden shelves are of interest as well as the documents relating to the discovery and conquest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Americas</ENAMEX> that rest on them.
Nearby, on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX> of the river, is another of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sevilla‚</ENAMEX>Äôs icons. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moorish Torre del Oro</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tower of Gold</ENAMEX>) is named after the gold-colored tiles that once covered the walls of this <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 13th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chess-piece castle</ENAMEX>. It is all that remains of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Sevilla‚Äôs medieval fortifications</ENAMEX>, and in times of possible invasion a huge metal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> was hauled from here to the other riverbank to protect the harbor. Originally used to store treasures brought from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Americas</ENAMEX>, it was also used as a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prison</ENAMEX> and is now a maritime <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>. The round top and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">spire</ENAMEX> were added in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the middle of the 18th century</TIMEX>. A visit to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Museo de Bellas Artes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum of Fine Arts</ENAMEX>), housed in an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 17th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">convent</ENAMEX> and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> most important <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>, will remind <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sevilla</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">birthplace</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spain‚</ENAMEX>Äôs greatest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vel√°zquez</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Murillo</ENAMEX>.
There are, of course, far too many other places of interest to mention here, but those with a little extra time should visit <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the following</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Casa de Pilatos</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hospital de la Caridad</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Charity Hospital</ENAMEX>), the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bullfighting Museum</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Plaza de Toros</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parque de los Descubrimientos</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Discovery Park</ENAMEX>) on the site of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Expo ‚</ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Äô92</NUMEX>, and the pedestrian shopping district centered on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Calle de las Sierpes</ENAMEX>. Don‚Äôt forget that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Europe‚</ENAMEX>Äôs best-known festivals take place here <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each spring</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Semana Santa</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holy Week</ENAMEX>) parades and the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Fer√≠a de Abril</ENAMEX> celebration.
Carmona
Carmona, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20 km</NUMEX> or so (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">12 miles</NUMEX>) east of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sevilla</ENAMEX> on the road to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C√≥rdoba</ENAMEX>, sits like a beacon on top of the only hill on an otherwise unrelenting plain. That position has given it strategic importance during its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5,000-year old</TIMEX> history. It was the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> era, though, that brought the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">area</ENAMEX> prosperity and wealth, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museo y Necropolis</ENAMEX> is the largest <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> necropolis outside of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX> itself.
The town‚Äôs fortunes declined after the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Romans</ENAMEX> left, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Moorish</ENAMEX> invasion of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">713</ENAMEX> brought with it renewed growth and prosperity. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moors‚Äô</ENAMEX> reign ended in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1247</TIMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carmona</ENAMEX> was re-conquered by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferdinand</ENAMEX> II. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> was divided among the victors, principally the orders of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santiago</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calatrava</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">The 14th and 15th centuries</TIMEX> were troublesome times as well. The discord was only brought to an end when, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1630</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Felipe IV</ENAMEX> agreed to grant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carmona</ENAMEX> the rights of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">township</ENAMEX>.
Carmona‚Äôs history is also unique because the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> was never under feudal rule, and was protected as a satellite of the crown. It is for this reason that there is such an extraordinary number of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palaces</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansions</ENAMEX>, convents, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Carmona</ENAMEX>. These alone make it worth a visit, and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> gates that linked the old card maxim (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Displays</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sevilla)¬†and Cordoba</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C√≥rdoba</ENAMEX>), shouldn‚Äôt be missed. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Displays</ENAMEX> is especially interesting; the gate is an unusually shaped small fortress.)
C√≥rdoba
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">These days</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">C√≥rdoba</ENAMEX>, a minor provincial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> sandwiched between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sevilla</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Granada</ENAMEX>, is often passed over by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Andaluc√≠a.</ENAMEX> But to do so is a considerable mistake. Besides having much charm, it has fabulous historic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">connections</ENAMEX> and an eclectic array of attractions to match. C√≥rdoba was once the largest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roman Spain</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Batik</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">birthplace</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Seneca the Younger</ENAMEX>, philosopher and tragedian.
Its golden era was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between the mid-8th</TIMEX> and very <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 11th centuries</TIMEX> when it was the center of the great medieval <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Caliphate of C√≥rdoba</ENAMEX>. With a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half a million</NUMEX>, it was one of the world‚Äôs largest and most cultured <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> and the splendid capital of the western <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Islamic Empire</ENAMEX>. It had the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">university</ENAMEX> and street lighting in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, and a library with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 400,000</NUMEX> volumes.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> is dominated by the greatest surviving monument from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that period</TIMEX> (which has the distinction of being the oldest monument in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day-to-day</TIMEX> use in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Western world)¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Great Mosque</ENAMEX>, otherwise known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Mezquita</ENAMEX>. Construction on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX> was begun in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">786</TIMEX>, but it was enlarged <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times before attaining its present size in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">987</TIMEX>. It covers an astounding area of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 hectares</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 acres</NUMEX>). C√≥rdoba was re-conquered in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1236</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> small <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chapels</ENAMEX> were added in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1258 and 1260</TIMEX>. No further major changes were made until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 16th century</TIMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carlos V</ENAMEX> decided to construct a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cathedral</ENAMEX> in the center of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX>.
Several gateways provide access through the high wall surrounding <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">La Mezquita</ENAMEX>, the most impressive being the monumental <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mud√©jar Puerta del Perd√≥n</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Gate of Forgiveness</ENAMEX>). Pass through it into the ceremonial forecourt of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Patio de los Naranjos</ENAMEX>, with its fountains and venerable orange <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>, to reach the entrance to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX>. Inside, as your eyes adjust to the dim light, you will see mesmerizing rows of columns extending into the shadows in every direction. Antique shafts of porphyry, onyx, marble, and jasper, they seem to grow out of the paving stones like <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> in an enchanted forest. The double arches overhead, striped in red-and-white, form a fanciful canopy of curving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branches</ENAMEX>.
At the far end, set in the southeast wall, is the splendid <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mihrab</ENAMEX>, lined with marble and gold mosaics, and the maksourah, the enclosure where the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">caliph</ENAMEX> attended to his prayers. In the central area of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">restorers</ENAMEX> have exposed to view a section of the original carved and painted wooden ceiling, which was covered over with vaulting in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 18th century</TIMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">cathedral</ENAMEX>, found at the very center of the forest of pillars, presents an overpowering contrast to its immediate surroundings. The understated simplicity¬†‚Äî¬†and lack of human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">images¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Islamic</ENAMEX> design fades completely and is replaced with an ornate blaze of color within which human images in either paint, stone, or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wood</ENAMEX> abound. Around the walls more <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> chapels line the perimeter of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">La Mezquita</ENAMEX> lies the labyrinth of narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> that makes up the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barrio de la Juder√≠a</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Jewish Quarter</TIMEX>). Some of the best <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> and tapas <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">C√≥rdoba</ENAMEX> are to be found here. Sights to look for include the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Callejon de las Flores</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alley</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Flowers</ENAMEX>), which is lined with <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> built around flower-filled patios that are typical of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C√≥rdoba</ENAMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 14th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sinagoga</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">synagogue</ENAMEX>) in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Judios</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">It‚Äôs a modest</ENAMEX> affair, just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>, with a balcony for female <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worshippers</ENAMEX>. C√≥rdoba‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> helped the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moors</ENAMEX> to gain control of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">711</TIMEX>, and they lived in peace under the caliphate.
Perhaps the most illustrious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">resident</ENAMEX> of the neighborhood was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moses Maim√≥nides</ENAMEX>. And a statue of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 12th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX>, philosopher, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">theologian</ENAMEX> stands a few steps from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">synagogue</ENAMEX> in the square named in his honor, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Plaza de Maim√≥nides</ENAMEX>. Also in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plaza</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Casa de las Bulas</ENAMEX>, which holds the interesting combination of a small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">market</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C√≥rdoban</ENAMEX> craftspeople selling <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">silver filigree</ENAMEX> and tooled <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">leather goods</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museo Taurino</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bullfighting Museum</ENAMEX>).
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northeast</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Plaza Jer√≥nimo Pa√©z</ENAMEX>, the splendid <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance Palacio Pa√</ENAMEX>©z <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museo Arqueol√≥gico Provincial</ENAMEX>. The exhibits span <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the centuries</TIMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Iberian</ENAMEX> era to the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Visigothic</ENAMEX> period, but pride of place goes to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 10th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medina Azahara</ENAMEX>, like the bronze <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">figure</ENAMEX> of a stag taken from a fountain presented by the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Byzantine emperor Constantine VII</ENAMEX>.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alfonso XI</ENAMEX>, built <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">C√≥rdoba‚Äôs Alc√°zar de los Reyes Cristianos</ENAMEX>, overlooking the river to the southwest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX>. The ramparts offer a fine view over the old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> and the river, the islets in midstream each occupied by a ruined <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moorish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mill</ENAMEX>, and the ridges of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sierra de C√≥rdoba</ENAMEX> low on the northern horizon. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catholic Monarchs</ENAMEX> received <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Columbus</ENAMEX> and planned the invasion of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Granada</ENAMEX> while <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> here.
Other places that are worth a visit are <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16th century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Palacio de los Marqueses de Viana</ENAMEX>, with its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> patios, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plaza de la Corredera</ENAMEX>, dating from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th century</TIMEX>. It is the only <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Castilian</ENAMEX>-style <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plaza</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Andaluc√≠a.</ENAMEX> Stroll to the unusual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plaza del Potro</ENAMEX>, which gets its name from the fountain in the center dating from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1577</TIMEX>. It is home to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> interesting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX>: the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Museo de Bellas Artes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fine Arts Museum</ENAMEX>) and the ever-popular <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Julio Romero de Torres Museum</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> devoted to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">C√≥rdoban</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX> of the same name. He was born nearby and specialized in mildly erotic paintings of rather beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C√≥rdob√</ENAMEX>©se <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Eight</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kilometers</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 miles</NUMEX>) west of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C√≥rdoba</ENAMEX> lies the ruins of the intriguing city <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cum palace</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medina Azahara</ENAMEX>. It was commissioned in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">936</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abdel-Rahman III</ENAMEX> in honor of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">favorite concubine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Zahra</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Flower</ENAMEX>), and its design was so grand that detailed records indicate that building materials were brought from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Constantinople</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">North African</ENAMEX> locations. Despite such auspicious beginnings, it had a short life; the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> was razed with the breakup of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caliphate of C√≥rdoba</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the very early 11th century</TIMEX>. Many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">materials</ENAMEX> were subsequently used on constructions in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sevilla</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX>. For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nearly 900 years</TIMEX>, it was left in ruins, and not until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1910</TIMEX> did the slow work of excavation begin. This still continues, but reconstructed royal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartments</ENAMEX> give some impression of the original magnificence of this sumptuous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">baths</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>, gardens, and stately <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartments</ENAMEX> built on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three terraces</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alcal√° la Real</ENAMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C√≥rdoba</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Granada</ENAMEX> is, in many <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX>, rather dramatic; you pass through mountainous scenery dotted with small white-walled <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> often crowned with castles. <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Alcal√° la Real</ENAMEX>, as it was known in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> times, was a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moorish</ENAMEX> fortified <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 8th century</TIMEX> and remained a strategic bastion until the re-conquest of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Granada</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1492</TIMEX>, after which further <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> monuments were added. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fortaleza de la Mota</ENAMEX>, on the summit at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,033</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3,389 ft</NUMEX>), is a very amazing complex combining <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moorish</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Christian</ENAMEX> influences, along with spectacular views. A particular fascination, and one both beautiful and gruesome, is the semi-ruined <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> whose floor has been partly excavated leaving tombs with bones and skulls exposed.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Granada</ENAMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nasrid</ENAMEX> dynasty rose to power in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Granada</ENAMEX> just as the fortunes of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Spanish Moors</ENAMEX> were beginning to wane (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>). The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of the line, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mohammed ben Alhamar</ENAMEX>, established his capital here in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1232</TIMEX>, after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferdinand III</ENAMEX> had forced him from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ja√©n.</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Two years later</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moors</ENAMEX> fleeing from the newly vanquished Sevilla swelled the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, which had already been augmented by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">refugees</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">C√≥rdoba</ENAMEX>. Rather than grieve for the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> they had left behind, the industrious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moors</ENAMEX> set about making <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Granada</ENAMEX> the grandest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Al Andalus</ENAMEX>. Over the course of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next century</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">hilltop</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alhambra</ENAMEX> took shape. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Granada</ENAMEX> was the last of the great <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Moorish</ENAMEX> kingdoms of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Andaluc√</ENAMEX>≠a to be re-conquered, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boabdil‚</ENAMEX>Äôs surrender to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catholic Monarchs</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 1492</TIMEX> marked the end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Empire</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>.
The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> most visited monument in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> is the world-famous <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alhambra</ENAMEX> (The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Red</ENAMEX>). It takes its name from the red-brown bricks used in the construction of its outer walls, which rise precipitously above the deep gorge of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">R√≠o Darro</ENAMEX>. Its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">towers</ENAMEX>, strategically, command superb views over the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> below.
Within the walls of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alhambra</ENAMEX>, there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> main areas to explore, which are best taken in the following order: the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alcazaba</ENAMEX> (fortress), the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Casa Real Vieja</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Old Royal Palace</ENAMEX>), the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Casa Real Nueva</ENAMEX> (new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Palace</ENAMEX>), and finally the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Generalife</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> gardens). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amazingly</ENAMEX>, this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> was allowed to fall into almost total disrepair over the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX>, and was used as a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">barracks</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Napoleon‚Äôs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> during the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Wars of Independence</ENAMEX>. It wasn‚Äôt until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1870</TIMEX> that it was designated a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Monument</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alcazaba</ENAMEX> is the oldest part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alhambra</ENAMEX> and only the impressive outer walls and towers survive. The main attraction is the view from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Torre de la Vela</ENAMEX>, north over <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Albaic√≠n</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sacramonte</ENAMEX> and south to the high snow-capped peaks of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sierra Nevada</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palacio Nazares</ENAMEX> is the highlight of the monument. It was the magnificent home of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rulers</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">kingdom</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Granada</ENAMEX>. Actually a series of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palaces</ENAMEX>, not just one, each <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace home</ENAMEX> has its own patios, fountains, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pools</ENAMEX>, and other adornments. The intricacy, delicacy, and bountiful beauty of the design creates a visual impression that is beyond mere words.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sal√≥n de Embajadores</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hall of the Ambassadors</ENAMEX>), or royal audience <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX>, is one of the most sumptuously ornamented <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alhambra</ENAMEX>. Skirted with geometric tiling, the walls and roof are overlaid with delicately shaped <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plaster stalactites</ENAMEX>, reaching <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> ft) to the carved and painted wooden ceiling. Verses from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Koran</ENAMEX> and the name of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 14th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">monarch Yusuf I</ENAMEX> are woven into the design. Through the tall, arched windows are magnificent views of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Albaic√≠n</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Darro</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sala de Abencerrajes</ENAMEX> recalls the aristocratic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of that name, who was accused of disloyalty and collusion with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christians</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boabdil</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX> invited the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abencerrajes</ENAMEX> to a reception in this very room, and massacred all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX> of the unsuspecting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family members</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Patio de los Leones</ENAMEX>, whose name derives from the splashing fountain in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">center</ENAMEX> upheld by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> stone <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">lions</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Torre de las Damas</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Tower of the Ladies</ENAMEX>), and the old bath area are of particular interest also.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Casa Real Nueva</ENAMEX>, though imposing, is as the name implies relatively new and architecturally at odds with the more ornate older <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palaces</ENAMEX>, some of which were destroyed to make way for it. Commissioned by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carlos V</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1527</TIMEX>, its exterior is in the shape of a square, with a surprisingly elegant <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-story circular patio on the inside. Considered on its own merits, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> must be regarded as a fine example of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> architecture.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX> are housed inside the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museo Nacional de Arte Hispano-Musulm√°n</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum of Hispano-Moorish Art</ENAMEX>), displays such evocative artifacts as the throne of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nasrids</ENAMEX>, a wooden armchair inlaid with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">silver</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ivory</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alhambra Vase</ENAMEX>, which once graced the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hall of the Two Sisters</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>, known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Museo de Bellas Artes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fine Arts Museum</ENAMEX>), contains a collection of works chronicling the development of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Granada</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between the 16th and 19th centuries</TIMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Generalife</ENAMEX> is found at the eastern end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alhambra</ENAMEX> fortifications on the neighboring hillside. A modest summer <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX>, it is surrounded by beautiful terraced gardens where oleander and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">roses bloom luxuriantly</ENAMEX> and delicate fountains and cascades play among the neatly clipped <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">cypress hedges</ENAMEX>.
Back down in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, the most prominent monument is the exquisite <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Capilla Real</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Chapel</ENAMEX>), a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> chapel that serves as the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mausoleum</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catholic Monarchs</ENAMEX>. The effigies of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ferdinand</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isabella</ENAMEX> lie on the right-hand side of the chancel, with those of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Juana La Loca</ENAMEX> and her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Felipe El Hermoso</ENAMEX> on the slightly higher monument on the left. Their mortal remains have been interred in the crypt underneath since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1521</TIMEX>, after a ceremonial transfer of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">remains</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alhambra</ENAMEX>. On exhibition in the sacristy are mementos of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catholic Monarchs</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ferdinand‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">sword</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Isabella‚</ENAMEX>Äôs scepter and crown, a circle of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX> embellished with acanthus scrolls.
The cathedral next door is large and imposing. A few steps away is the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alcaicer√≠a</ENAMEX> area, the old silk market of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moors</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">These days</TIMEX>, it is a colorful collection of narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> that serve as a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> for the sale of handicrafts and souvenirs. Not far away is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corral del Carb√≥n</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House of Coal</ENAMEX>). Dating from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 12th century</TIMEX>, it is the oldest Moorish monument in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, and is now a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> for typical <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Granadino</ENAMEX> arts and crafts.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albaic√≠n</ENAMEX>, the old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moorish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">district</ENAMEX> on the hill opposite the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alhambra</ENAMEX>, has a maze of narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">staircases</ENAMEX> surrounding its ancient whitewashed <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> and enclosed patio gardens. Down by the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Darro River</ENAMEX> is the exquisite <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Casa de Castril</ENAMEX>, dating from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1539</TIMEX> and home of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Archaeological Museum</ENAMEX> as well as nearby <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Ba√±uelo</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Moorish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">baths</ENAMEX>). Farther up the hill is the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mirador San Nicol√°s</ENAMEX>. From here, you get the best view of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alhambra</ENAMEX> framed by the snowcapped <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sierra Nevada</ENAMEX> mountains in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">background¬†‚Äî¬†a</ENAMEX> scene replicated on many postcards. High to the right of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Albaic√</ENAMEX>≠n is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gitano</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gypsy</ENAMEX>) area of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sacramonte</ENAMEX>, famous for its caves and tablaos (literally <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stages</ENAMEX>) where gypsies, for the benefit of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX>, reenact wedding ceremonies. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Tourists</ENAMEX>, though, should be wary, especially at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>, as this is not the safest part of town.
Lying <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 50 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">32 miles</NUMEX>) east of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Granada</ENAMEX> on the road to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Murcia</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guadix</ENAMEX>, a particularly unusual <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> in that many of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhabitants</ENAMEX> are troglodytes. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barrio Santiago</ENAMEX>, there are <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> that have their own small front <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">yards</ENAMEX> and fa√ßades that, on the surface, make them indistinguishable from ordinary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX>. Look closely, though, and the white, circular chimneys emanating from the rocks give the game away. These are actually caves with a practical use: they‚Äôre cool in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> and warm in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX>. There is plenty else of interest here, including a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moorish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> dating from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 10th and 11th centuries</TIMEX>, a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late 16th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">cathedral</ENAMEX>, and many important <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palaces</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las</ENAMEX> Alpujarras
This is a remote area even <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, located as it is between the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sierra Nevada</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sierra de la Contraviesa</ENAMEX> mountain ranges, with the southern <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">slopes</ENAMEX> of the latter dropping graciously into the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean Sea</ENAMEX>. Not particularly pretty, it is dotted with small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> that retain many appearances of a lifestyle long since departed from other areas. The way of life here in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 20th century</TIMEX> was detailed explicitly by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gerald Brenan</ENAMEX> in his book <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Granada</ENAMEX>. In fact, these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> fall into one of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> areas depending on their altitude and climate; those in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">La Alpujarra Alta</ENAMEX> (the high <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alpujarra</ENAMEX>), just south of the highest peaks in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sierra Nevada</ENAMEX> and those in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">La Alpujarra Baja</ENAMEX> (the low <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alpujarra</ENAMEX>) in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sierra de la Contraviesa</ENAMEX>. Trevelez, considered the highest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>, is famous for its jam√≥n serrano (dried cured <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ham</ENAMEX>), and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lanjar√≥n</ENAMEX> is familiar throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> as the name on the red, green, and white label on bottles of water originating from the town‚Äôs <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">springs</TIMEX>. Incidentally, that same <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> runs free from the fuentes (fountains) of many <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX>.
The main entrance to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Las Alpujarras</ENAMEX> is from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Granada</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Motril</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>; the same <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> along which the defeated <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moors</ENAMEX> traveled on their way to exile. Even <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, there is a place on that road, just <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">12 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">8 miles</NUMEX>) south of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Granada</ENAMEX>, that bears the sad name <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Puerto del Suspiro del Moro</ENAMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Pass of the Sigh of the Moor</ENAMEX>). It is from here that distant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Granada</ENAMEX> finally fades from view, and the land takes its name from the comments made by the defeated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boabdil‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> when he, supposedly, wept while looking back at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. Somewhat cruelly, she is reported to have told him, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt cry like a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> for something you couldn‚Äôt defend as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>.‚Äù
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Andaluc√≠a‚Äôs Natural Parks</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Andaluc√≠a</ENAMEX> has an abundance of natural <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX>, ranging from those with international fame to more obscure, remote nature preserves. Below some of the most interesting are described.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sierra Morena</ENAMEX> This <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">nearly 480 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">300-mile</NUMEX>) mountain range runs from the mountains of southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX> in the west to the border of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Provincia de Murcia</ENAMEX> in the east, effectively forming the border between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Andaluc√≠a</ENAMEX> and most of the rest of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>.
Covering an area of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">524,000 hectares</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,290,000 acres</NUMEX>), the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sierra Morena</ENAMEX> encompasses no <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fewer than seven</NUMEX> natural <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX>, namely: the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sierra de Aracena y Picos de Aroche</ENAMEX>; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sierra Norte de Sevilla</ENAMEX>; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sierra de Hornachuelos</ENAMEX>; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sierra Carde√±a y Montoro</ENAMEX>; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sierra de And√∫jar; Despe√±aperros</ENAMEX>; and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sierra de Cazorla</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Segurla y Las Villas</ENAMEX>.
Each of these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX> has its own attributes, and the whole area is a stronghold of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Spanish Lynx</ENAMEX>, but the highest peaks and the most dramatic scenery is found in the last of these, which is also the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">birthplace</ENAMEX> of the great <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Guadalquivir River</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Do√±ana National Park</ENAMEX> This is probably the most famous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>. It holds many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">national</ENAMEX> and international honors, and is even listed as a World Heritage Site. Consisting of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">86,208 hectares</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">213,020 acres</NUMEX>), it is bordered on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sides</ENAMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic Ocean</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Guadalquivir River</ENAMEX> as it winds its way down from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sevilla</ENAMEX> to reach the ocean at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sanl√∫car de Barrameda</ENAMEX>. In fact, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Do√±ana</ENAMEX> is the last great lowland wilderness <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">sanctuary</ENAMEX> in southern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, and has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> distinct ecosystems: the marismas (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt marshes</ENAMEX>), matorral (brushwood), and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">las dunas</ENAMEX> (sand dunes). Within its bounds can be found an amazing array of animal, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bird</ENAMEX>, and plant life, but what you see is very much dependent upon the time of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> you visit and, even then, can be very hit or miss.
The only way to really see the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> is on a tour organized by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Coop</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Andaluz Marismas del Rocio</ENAMEX>, whose large-wheel buses depart from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">visitors‚Äô center</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">El Acebuche</ENAMEX>. Be forewarned, though: this is a very bumpy, rough ride, and definitely not advisable for those with artificial hips or physical handicaps. Lasting <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about four hours</TIMEX>, it enters the sand dunes at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Matalasca√±as</ENAMEX> and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> part of the trip is along <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">35 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">nearly 20 miles</NUMEX>) of unspoiled beaches. The only human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> here are the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fishermen</ENAMEX> living in what look like very ramshackle huts, albeit with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4-wheel</NUMEX> drive <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicles</ENAMEX> and TV antennas on display. The vast stretches of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt marshes</ENAMEX> are fascinating, with many <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> living along the edge of the grassland adjoining them. The huge sand dunes, perpetually changing, make for a surreal sight.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Laguna de Medina</ENAMEX> Across the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guadalquivir</ENAMEX> and just <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 10 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6 miles</NUMEX>) east of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jerez de la Frontera</ENAMEX> is this small lake, one of the last stops in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> migrating south from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">northern</ENAMEX> and central <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of August</TIMEX>. In periods of drought it is attractive to <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> that usually reside at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Do√±ana</ENAMEX>, and around <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> have been observed here.
Grazalema A short distance to the east of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Laguna de Medina</ENAMEX> is the mainly mountain wilderness of the natural <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grazalema</ENAMEX>. Its <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">51,695 hectares</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">127,740 acres</NUMEX>) are home to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> species of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eagles</ENAMEX> and numerous other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX>, mammals, and reptiles. Interestingly, the mountains here, which range <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">between 1,000 and 1,700 meters</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3,300 and 5,600 ft</NUMEX>), are the first stop for clouds arriving from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX>, giving the area the greatest <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rainfall</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>. This allows a fine array of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flora</ENAMEX> to thrive. Of particular note is the rare abies pinsapo (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> fir <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>).
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">El Torcal de Antequera</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fuente de Piedra</ENAMEX> Just south of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Antequera</ENAMEX> is one of the more famous geological formations in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>. The limestone mountains of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">El Torcal de Antequera</ENAMEX> have eroded to form some of the most unusual shapes seen anywhere. In fact, these formations so resemble modern sculptures that they have been assigned comical names. Just north of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Antequera</ENAMEX>, droughts notwithstanding, is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fuente de Piedra, Andaluc√≠a‚Äôs</ENAMEX> largest lake, with a surface area that can reach <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,384 hectares</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3,420 acres</NUMEX>). Each <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">spring</TIMEX>, provided that weather conditions are favorable, it becomes a home to flamingos. In fact, it is the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only</NUMEX> inland breeding area in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> for this colorful species. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Springtime</ENAMEX> means the islet of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">La Colonia</ENAMEX> becomes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the most crowded bird habitats anywhere (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 16,000</NUMEX> breeding pairs were identified in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>). Over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">150</NUMEX> species of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> have been counted on the lake or in surrounding areas.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sierra Nevada & Las Alpujarras</ENAMEX> This recently created national <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>, which begins near <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Granada</ENAMEX>, has the distinction of having the highest peak on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> mainland (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mulhac√</ENAMEX>©n is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3,482 meters</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">11,420 ft</NUMEX>) tall) and a wide diversity of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flora</ENAMEX> made possible by the nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean Biosphere</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reserve</ENAMEX>. It also has the highest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. Along it is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Solynieve</ENAMEX> (literally <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sun</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Snow</ENAMEX>) skiing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX>, accessible <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year-round</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 2,500</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">8,000 ft</NUMEX>), and the more elevated <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pico Veleta</ENAMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Weathercock</ENAMEX>) at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,398</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">11,148 ft</NUMEX>), which can only be reached during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few short weeks</TIMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX>.
