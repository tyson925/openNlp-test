Where to Go
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barcelona</ENAMEX> is best approached by neighborhood or, perhaps, theme. You can set out to see the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Gothic Quarter, Montju√Øc hill</ENAMEX>, or the waterfront; or you can create a greatest-hits tour of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gaud√≠</ENAMEX> and his fellow <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Modernista</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architects</ENAMEX>. It‚Äôs tempting to try to sandwich everything into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">just a couple of days</TIMEX>, but be sure to leave time in your schedule to get sidetracked in a colorful food market or an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">alley</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antiques</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, or to peek in a quiet <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX>. Take a breather, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barcelonans</ENAMEX> do, sinking into a chair at a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sidewalk</ENAMEX> table to linger over a drink and snack, read a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>-watch. 
In the old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, where many <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> are too narrow for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> and a slow pace is amply rewarded with the discovery of hidden treasures, the best way to travel is on foot. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">district</ENAMEX> of the old <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">quarter¬†‚Äî¬†Barri G√≤tic</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">La Ribera</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Las Ramblas¬†‚Äî¬†and</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Eixample</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">district</ENAMEX> can be covered as a walking tour. For sights farther afield, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montju√Øc, Barceloneta</ENAMEX> and the waterfront, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tibidabo</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of the top <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gaud√</ENAMEX>≠ attractions, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">La Sagrada Familia and Parque Gu√´ll</ENAMEX>, it‚Äôs best to make use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barcelona‚</ENAMEX>Äôs excellent public transportation <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">network¬†‚Äî¬†clean</ENAMEX> and efficient metro <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trains</ENAMEX> (subway), modern <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">buses</ENAMEX>, funiculars, and cable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cars¬</ENAMEX>†‚Äî¬†as well as plenty of inexpensive <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">taxis</ENAMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Public Transportation</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p. 121</ENAMEX>). A good map is essential, but it‚Äôs easy to be fooled by how near things look on paper. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Rambla</ENAMEX>
To call <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">La Rambla</ENAMEX> a mere <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> is to do it woeful injustice. Barcelona‚Äôs most famous <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">boulevard¬†‚Äî¬†energetic</ENAMEX>, artistic, democratic, and indulgent¬†‚Äî¬†is an intoxicating parade of humanity. You‚Äôll no doubt want to sample it several times during your stay (maybe even several times a day) in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barcelona.</ENAMEX> It is most crowded just before the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">lunch hour and in the early evening</TIMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekdays</TIMEX> and at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">dusk</TIMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekends</TIMEX>, though it is never deserted. In the wee, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">wee hours</TIMEX> it‚Äôs populated by a sometimes motley mix of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early-morning</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper sellers</ENAMEX>, streetsweepers, and bar hounds stumbling back to their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartments</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX>. 
The broad, tree-shaded, and pedestrian-only <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">promenade</ENAMEX> stretches nearly <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 mile</NUMEX>) down a gentle incline from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">city‚Äôs hub</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pla√ßa de Catalunya</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">54</NUMEX>), to the waterfront. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Rambla</ENAMEX> takes its name from an <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Arabic</ENAMEX> word meaning a sandy, dry river bed. It was a shallow gully until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 14th century</TIMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barcelona</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> began to construct <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> nearby. As the area became more populated, the stream was soon paved over. To the north of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Las Ramblas</ENAMEX> (left as you walk down it) is the old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ciutat Vella</ENAMEX>; to the south, or right, is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Raval</ENAMEX>. 
The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> sections of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Rambla</ENAMEX> change in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX>, as they do in name, as you stroll along. The short <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rambla de Canaletes</ENAMEX> at the top is where crowds pour in from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pla√ßa de Catalunya</ENAMEX> or emerge from the metro and train <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stations</ENAMEX> beneath. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sundays</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Mondays</TIMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX> you‚Äôll find rambunctious knots of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fans</ENAMEX> replaying the games of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bar√ßa</ENAMEX>, the popular name for <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">Barcelona‚Äôs beloved football</ENAMEX> (soccer) club <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barcelona F.C.</ENAMEX>; if an important match has just been won, look out. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Elderly denizens</ENAMEX> relax on metal chairs (for which you are supposed to pay) and watch the passing parade. Here, too, begin the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stalls</ENAMEX> where you can buy a diverse stock of foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazines</ENAMEX>, as well as books, a reflection of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Barcelona‚Äôs</ENAMEX> status as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spain‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> of publishing. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">You‚Äôll</ENAMEX> also see the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Rambla‚</ENAMEX>Äôs celebrated mimes, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúhuman statues,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù</ENAMEX> portraying <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher Columbus</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priests</ENAMEX>, bearded <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nuns</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX>, among many other guises.
Next up is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rambla dels Estudis</ENAMEX>, popularly called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rambla dels Ocells (‚Äúof birds‚Äù</ENAMEX>) because here the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">boulevard</ENAMEX> narrows to become an outdoor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">aviary</ENAMEX> where winged <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">creatures</ENAMEX> of all descriptions are sold. When the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendors</ENAMEX> leave at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the day</TIMEX>, their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cage</ENAMEX>-lined <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stalls</ENAMEX> are folded and shut like wardrobes, with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> rustling about inside. Birds give way to <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rambla de les Flors</ENAMEX>, officially called the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rambla de Sant Josep</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> flock here on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23 April</TIMEX>, the feast day of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barcelona‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patron saint</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sant Jordi</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. George</ENAMEX>), celebrated <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">as Day of the Book</ENAMEX>. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> traditionally gives her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> a book, and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> gives a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> a rose‚Äîboth of which are available in abundance along <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">La Rambla</ENAMEX>. Keep an eye peeled on the right side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> for the delectable modernista pastry <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Escrib√†</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Antiga Casa Figueres</ENAMEX>), its fanciful <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">swirls</ENAMEX> on the outside a match for the delicacies within.
Facing the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">‚Äúlane of Flowers‚</ENAMEX>Äù is the elegant <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palau de la Virreina</ENAMEX>, a palace completed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1778</TIMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">widow</ENAMEX> of the viceroy of colonial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Peru</ENAMEX>. At street level is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> of the city‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Culture</ENAMEX> where tickets to municipal concerts are sold or offered, and information about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX> and current exhibitions is available. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> holds a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> with rotating contemporary art exhibits. 
Set back from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> is one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Rambla‚</ENAMEX>Äôs great attractions and a constant in the life of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barcelonans</ENAMEX>: the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mercat de Sant Josep</ENAMEX>, also called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">La Boquer√≠a</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">This 19th-century</TIMEX> covered market is an overflowing cornucopia of delights for the senses: fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meats</ENAMEX>; sausages; <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruits</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetables</ENAMEX>; and all kinds of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spices</ENAMEX>, neatly braided ropes of garlic, sun-dried <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tomatoes</ENAMEX> and peppers, preserves, and sweetmeats, to make a gourmand swoon. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Boqueria</ENAMEX> is also a startlingly vibrant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shoppers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">merchants</ENAMEX> greet each other by name, ribald sallies across the aisles set off gales of laughter, and the freshness of the rape (an angler <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> popular in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Catalonia</ENAMEX>) is debated with the passion of a traffic mishap. The huge market is laid out under high-ceilinged ironwork naves, like a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">railway station</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Restaurants</ENAMEX> in and near the market are like first-aid <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stations</ENAMEX> for those who become faint with hunger at the sight of such bounty. The market opens before dawn, but closes down by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">late afternoon</TIMEX>. The best time to visit is when practiced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shoppers</ENAMEX> do: In <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX>.
The heart of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ramblas</ENAMEX> is nearby, at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pla de la Boquer√≠a</ENAMEX>, a busy intersection near the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Liceu</ENAMEX> metro <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX> paved with an unmistakable <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joan Mir√≥</ENAMEX> mosaic. Here stands one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Europe‚</ENAMEX>Äôs great opera <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gran Teatre del Liceu</ENAMEX>, inaugurated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1847</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Catalan opera greats Montserrat Caball√© and Josep Carreras</ENAMEX> made their reputations singing at this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Liceu</ENAMEX>, a monument of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catalan Renaissance</ENAMEX> and refuge of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catalan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elite</ENAMEX>. The opera <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> was gutted by a terrible fire in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX> (the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> it has suffered), forcing its closing. After a stunning restoration project that preserved the soul of the historic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">theater</ENAMEX> while adding technological improvements to equip this magnificent opera <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 21st century</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Liceu</ENAMEX> reopened in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>. 
Directly across the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rambla</ENAMEX> is the venerable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caf√© de l‚ÄôOpera</ENAMEX>, a handsome old-world caf√© that‚Äôs always bursting with boisterous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patrons</ENAMEX>. It‚Äôs a good spot for refreshment before you push on down the next stretch, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rambla dels Caputxins</ENAMEX>. This Rambla‚Äôs demeanor, like the incline, proceeds downhill after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Liceu</ENAMEX>, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>-entertainment factor rises in inverse proportion. You‚Äôll wade your way through <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">jugglers</ENAMEX>, fire-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">eaters</ENAMEX>, tarot-card <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX>, lottery-ticket <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sellers</ENAMEX>, more mimes, mendicants, and many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> rapidly knocking out portraits, caricatures, and chalk masterwork reproductions on the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pavement</ENAMEX>. 
On the right side of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Rambla</ENAMEX> is the old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hotel Oriente</ENAMEX>, which preserves part of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th century</TIMEX> cloister of a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Franciscan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> inside. Note the na√Øve painted angels floating over the doorway at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hemingway‚</ENAMEX>Äôs favorite <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barcelona</ENAMEX> lodging. Just beyond the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX> on the carrer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nou de la Rambla</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palau G√ºell</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">mansion Gaud√≠</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>) built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1885</TIMEX> for his principal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patron</ENAMEX>, the textile <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tycoon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Count Eusebi G√ºell</ENAMEX>. This meticulously detailed, fortress-like <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX>, a study in high <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gothic</ENAMEX>, is now open for guided tours. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Visitors</ENAMEX> get to see the fabulously tiled rooftop chimneys, which were hidden from view for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX>.
Returning to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ramblas</ENAMEX>, cross over and follow the short passage that leads into the arcaded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pla√ßa Reial</ENAMEX>. This handsome and spacious <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> is graced with a fountain, palm <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>, and wrought-iron lamp-posts designed by the young <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Gaud√≠</ENAMEX>. Like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boquer√≠a</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hotel Oriente</ENAMEX>, and other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Rambla</ENAMEX> landmarks, this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> came into being as a result of the destruction of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">convent</ENAMEX>, when church properties were expropriated in an anti-clerical period in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-19th century</TIMEX>. Not long ago it was the stomping grounds of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">junkies</ENAMEX> and petty <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">thieves</ENAMEX>, but it has been since revitalized and is flush with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bars</ENAMEX>, caf√©s, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>.
The final promenade leading down to the harbor is the short <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rambla de Santa M√≤nica</ENAMEX>, beginning at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pla√ßa del Teatre</ENAMEX>, site of the run-down <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Teatre Principal</ENAMEX>. Though the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Centre</ENAMEX> d‚ÄôArt <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santa M√≤nica</ENAMEX> puts on fine contemporary art exhibits, the area continues to be the beat of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prostitutes</ENAMEX> and cops, pickpockets, and bag-snatchers. The warren of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">alleys</ENAMEX> to the right is the once-notorious <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barri Xino</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chinatown</ENAMEX>. With the new openness of the post-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Franco</ENAMEX> era it has lost much of its seedy interest, but it‚Äôs still not the best place for a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midnight</TIMEX> stroll. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carrer dels Escudellers</ENAMEX>, a busy pedestrian <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> on the other side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rambla</ENAMEX>, is the gateway to a district of cabarets, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX>, flamenco shows, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, and the delights of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Gothic Quarter</ENAMEX>. Nearer the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port</ENAMEX>, a passage leads to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museu de Cera</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wax Museum</ENAMEX>), a tourist trap with a collection of some <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three hundred</NUMEX> realistic wax effigies. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rambla</ENAMEX> ends at the broad open space facing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Monument √† Colom</ENAMEX>, a statue honoring the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">discoverer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher Columbus</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colom</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Catalan</ENAMEX>) that can be climbed for good views of the port. Poor <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Columbus</ENAMEX> is supposed to be indicating the way to the riches of the New World, but he‚Äôs actually pointing at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mallorca</ENAMEX> or perhaps <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North Africa</ENAMEX>. Just beyond the statue is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barcelona‚</ENAMEX>Äôs newly revitalized waterfront.
Barri G√ític
From its beginnings <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than two thousand years ago</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barcelona</ENAMEX> has grown outwards in rings, like concentric ripples on a pond. The ancient core is a hill the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Romans</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mons Taber</ENAMEX>, where they raised a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Augustus Caesar</ENAMEX> and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fourth century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">a.d.</ENAMEX> built high walls about a mile around to protect their settlement. This is the nucleus of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">medieval district</ENAMEX> called the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barri G√≤tic</ENAMEX>. While much of it is not technically <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gothic</ENAMEX>, it is a remarkable concentration of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">medieval palaces</ENAMEX>, convents, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX>.
The best place to begin a tour of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the quarter</TIMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Catedral¬†‚Äî¬†Barcelona‚Äôs superb cathedral</ENAMEX>, which is the neighborhood‚Äôs major <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">site</ENAMEX> and focal point. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">cathedral</ENAMEX> was begun in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1298</TIMEX> on the site of earlier <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX> going back to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Visigothic</ENAMEX> times. The final touch¬<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">†‚Äî¬†the rather florid Gothic fa√ßade¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†was not completed until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the 19th century</TIMEX> and thus contrasts with the simple octagonal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">towers</ENAMEX>. The ribs of the cathedral‚Äôs high <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">vault</ENAMEX> are joined at carved and painted keystone medallions, a typically <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catalan</ENAMEX> feature. In the center of the nave is a splendid <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gothic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">choir</ENAMEX> with lacy spires of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carved wood</ENAMEX>. Above these are the heraldic emblems of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">kings</ENAMEX> and princes invited by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles V</ENAMEX> to be <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of his exclusive Order of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golden Fleece</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Toison d‚ÄôOr</NUMEX>). The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> and only meeting was held in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">cathedral</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1519</TIMEX>. The seats reserved for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Henry VIII of England</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Fran√ßois I</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> are next to the emperor‚Äôs, but they didn‚Äôt bother to come.
Connected to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">choir</ENAMEX> is a pulpit with an exceptional wrought-iron stair rail. Ahead, steps under the altar lead to the alabaster <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tomb</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Eul√†lia</ENAMEX>, one of the city‚Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patron saints</ENAMEX>, martyred in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fourth century</TIMEX>. On the wall of the right aisle are the tombs of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Count Ram√≥n Berenguer I</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Almodis</ENAMEX>, who founded the earlier cathedral on this spot in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1058¬†‚</NUMEX>Äî¬†each was apparently very short. Don‚Äôt miss the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catalan Gothic</ENAMEX> altarpieces in the chapels behind the altar; the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panels</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transfiguration</ENAMEX> painted for the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">San Benito chapel</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 15th century</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bernat Martorell</ENAMEX> are considered his masterpiece.
The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">leafy</TIMEX> cloister is a lively refuge, with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds fluttering</ENAMEX> among the orange, magnolia, and palm <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> that entirely fill its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>. Watch where you walk, as the cloister is paved with tombstones, badly worn, but many still bearing the emblems of the bootmakers, tailors, and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">craft</ENAMEX> guilds whose wealth helped pay for the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">cathedral</ENAMEX>. From the cloister, pass to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Capella de Santa Ll√∫cia</ENAMEX>, a chapel with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13th- and 14th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tombstones</ENAMEX> on the floor and a monument to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crusader knight</ENAMEX> in armor on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wall</ENAMEX>. 
Leaving the chapel by its front entrance, turn left at carrer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">del Bisbe Irurita</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">corner house</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Number 8</ENAMEX> was until recently the official <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Generalitat</ENAMEX>. Train your eyes upwards as you walk through the old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> to take in the details, e.g., a curious hanging sign, a lantern, or an unusual sculpture. On the right you‚Äôll find a row of gargoyles leaning from the roof of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palau de la Generalitat</ENAMEX>, the seat of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Autonomous Region</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catalonia</ENAMEX>, and a richly ornamented gateway. The lacy overhead <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gothic</ENAMEX> only in style; it‚Äôs actually a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1929</TIMEX> addition.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Just ahead</TIMEX> is the spacious, serious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pla√ßa de Sant Jaume</ENAMEX>, the heart of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barri G√≤tic</ENAMEX>. A local joke says that the farthest distance in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barcelona</ENAMEX> is across this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>, which separates the often antagonistic and conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Generalitat</ENAMEX> from the more progressive municipal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ajuntament</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">City Hall</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Architecturally</ENAMEX>, though, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> make a harmonious pair: both have classical fa√ßades that hide their Gothic origins. To visit either <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>, you‚Äôll need luck and planning; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Generalitat</ENAMEX> can only be visited on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23 April</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Day of St. George</ENAMEX>), and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ajuntament</ENAMEX> only with an organized <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> and by appointment (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">113</NUMEX>).
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palau de la Generalitat</ENAMEX>, on the north side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> (closer to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cathedral</ENAMEX>), is the more interesting of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palaces</ENAMEX>. This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX> dates from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1359</TIMEX>, when it was made the executive branch reporting to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parliament</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corts of Catalanes</ENAMEX>. The nucleus of the present <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> is the main patio¬<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">†‚Äî¬†pure Catalan Gothic</ENAMEX>, with an open <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">staircase</ENAMEX> leading to a gallery of arches on slender pillars. The building‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">star</ENAMEX> feature is the flamboyant <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gothic</ENAMEX> fa√ßade of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Capella de Sant Jordi</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sal√≥ de Sant Jordi</ENAMEX> (there‚Äôs no escaping <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. George</ENAMEX> here), a large vaulted <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th-century</TIMEX> front block of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>, is lined with modern murals of historical scenes. 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ajuntament</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Casa de la Ciutat</ENAMEX>, across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plaza</ENAMEX> has held <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barcelona‚Äôs</ENAMEX> city <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1372</TIMEX>. It was here that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Consell de Cent</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">council</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> notable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX>, met to deal with civic affairs under the watchful eyes of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX>. The original entrance can be seen around the left corner of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>, on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">carrer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de la Ciutat</ENAMEX>. Inside, the left staircase leads to the upper <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">gallery</ENAMEX> of the old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX> and to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sal√≥ de Cent</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hall of the One Hundred</ENAMEX>). Its high ceiling resembles the barrel-vault of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sal√≥ del Tinell</ENAMEX>, and was built at about the same time in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 14th century</TIMEX>. The red-and-yellow <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catalonia‚Äôs</ENAMEX> flag decorate the walls. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX> where the city council now meets adjoins, and at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of the black marble <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">staircase</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sal√≥ de les Cr√≤niques</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Hall of the Chronicles</ENAMEX>), noted for the modern murals in sepia tones by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Josep Maria Sert</ENAMEX>. 
From behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ajuntament</ENAMEX>, take the short carrer d‚ÄôH√®rcules to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pla√ßa de Sant</ENAMEX> Just for a quick peek at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Sants Just i Pastor</ENAMEX> and the small, charming, quiet square it sits on, evocative of a bygone <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barcelona.</ENAMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> is one of the oldest in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, though often remodeled. It is said that any will to which one swears before the church‚Äôs altar is recognized as valid by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barcelona</ENAMEX>, a practice that dates to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tenth</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">century</TIMEX>.
Heading back to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pla√ßa de Sant Jaume</ENAMEX>, turn right on carrer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de la Llibreteria</ENAMEX>, a small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> lined with pastry <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> and one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barcelona‚</ENAMEX>Äôs oldest, tiniest, and coolest coffee <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Mes√≥n del Caf√©</ENAMEX>. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> of blocks down on the left, on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pla√ßa del Rei, s/n</ENAMEX>, is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Museu d‚ÄôHist√≤ria de la Ciutat</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">City History Museum</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gothic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansion</ENAMEX> that was moved stone by stone to this location. The chief attraction is in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">basement</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">excavations</ENAMEX> have uncovered the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">foundations</ENAMEX>, including sculptures, walls, a bathing pool, and cemeteries filled with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Romans</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Visigoths</ENAMEX> who once inhabited the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. On upper <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floors</ENAMEX> are maps of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Catalan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX>, the original plans for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th century</TIMEX> expansion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> that created the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Eixample</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">district</ENAMEX>, and other historical documents and artifacts. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Visitors</ENAMEX> can also see a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">28-minute</TIMEX> ‚Äúvirtual history‚Äù multimedia film about Barcino-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barcelona.</ENAMEX>
From the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> it is a step to the gorgeously austere <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pla√ßa del Rei</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palau Reial</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Palace</ENAMEX>), which is dominated by the many-arched lookout <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin</ENAMEX> and, atop the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> walls, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Capella de Santa √Ägata</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Chapel</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. Agatha</ENAMEX>). (Both can be visited as part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Muesu</ENAMEX> d‚ÄôHist√≤ria.The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">chapel</ENAMEX> is notable for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 15th century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">altarpiece of the Adoration of the Magi</ENAMEX> by one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catalonia‚</ENAMEX>Äôs finest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaume Huguet</ENAMEX>. 
In the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> with the broad staircase is all that is left of the original <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Palace</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catalonia</ENAMEX>, begun in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tenth</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">century</TIMEX> and added to over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</TIMEX> until it took up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sides</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> and extended to the rear. During the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Inquisition</ENAMEX>, suspected heretics were burned at the stake in this enclosure, and here <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferdinand</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isabella</ENAMEX> received <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Columbus</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1493</TIMEX> on his return from his first voyage. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbus</ENAMEX> probably gave his report in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sal√≥ del Tinell</ENAMEX>. This vast barrel-vaulted <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX> was built for royal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audiences</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1359</TIMEX>, and on occasion the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catalan Corts</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parliament</ENAMEX>) met here. The palace‚Äôs central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">section</ENAMEX>, chapel, and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX> were reconstructed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1943 and 1952</TIMEX>. Outdoor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">theater</ENAMEX> and concerts are held in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX>. 
A former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX> of the palace which encloses the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pla√ßa del Rei</ENAMEX> was rebuilt in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1557</TIMEX> to become the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palau del Lloctinent</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palace</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lieutenant</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX> of the king‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX>. It now houses the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Archives of Arag√≥n</ENAMEX>. The entrance, reached by leaving the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace square</ENAMEX> and turning right on the carrer dels <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Comtes</ENAMEX>, is an elegant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patio</ENAMEX> with a noble staircase and remarkable carved wooden ceiling. 
Just beyond, flanking the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">cathedral</ENAMEX>, is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Museu Frederic Mar√®s</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mar√®s</ENAMEX>, a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sculptor</ENAMEX> of civic statues, was a compulsive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">collector</ENAMEX> who bequeathed to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barcelona</ENAMEX> an unusually idiosyncratic collection of art and, well, miscellany. The lower floors of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> are stocked with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iberian</ENAMEX> votive figurines, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Limoges</ENAMEX> enamel boxes, and religious sculptures from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 12th</TIMEX> to 19th <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">You‚Äôll</ENAMEX> also find <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> carved <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ox yokes</ENAMEX>, a roomful of iron keys, old sewing machines, canes, wind-up <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">toys¬†‚Äî¬†in</ENAMEX> short an endless catalogue of art and artifacts. There is even the suitcase, covered with travel stickers, which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mar√©s</ENAMEX> used to cart home his loot.
Retracing your steps on the narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> flanking the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">cathedral</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">circle</ENAMEX> around to the rear and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">duck</ENAMEX> into the narrow carrer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">del Parad√≠s.</ENAMEX> Here, just inside the doorway of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Centre Excursionista de Catalunya</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> columns of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roman Temple</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Augustus</ENAMEX> are embedded in the wall.
Behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Palace</ENAMEX>, off carrer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tapineria</ENAMEX>, is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pla√ßa de Berenguer el Gran</ENAMEX>, which has a well-preserved section of the original <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> wall. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">defenses</ENAMEX> were <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">9 meters</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">30 feet</NUMEX>) high and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3.5 meters</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">12 feet</NUMEX>) thick and were marked at intervals by towers <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">18 meters</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">59 feet</NUMEX>) tall. Until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1943</TIMEX>, most of this section was covered by a clutter of old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>, which were dismantled and relocated to restore the walls and old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansions</ENAMEX> to view.
Since ancient times, when <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> main <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> thoroughfares intersected at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pla√ßa de Sant Jaume</ENAMEX>, this has been the crossroads of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barcelona.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Streets radiate</ENAMEX> in all directions, each an invitation to explore the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barri G√≤tic</ENAMEX>. The carrer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">del Call</ENAMEX> leads into the labyrinth of narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> that was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Call</ENAMEX>, or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Jewish Quarter</TIMEX>, until the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> were expelled in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1492</TIMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today the quarter</TIMEX> is a bustling corner of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antiques</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX> of rare books, plus <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bars</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> frequented by antiquarians and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX>. 
Although many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> retain the word Call in their names, there are few vestiges left of the ghetto, which once was surrounded by a wall. Barcelona‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX>, though noted as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">jewelers</ENAMEX>, and despite their financing of the conquests of the crown, were confined to this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">district</ENAMEX> and forced to wear long-hooded cloaks with a yellow headband. Taxation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX> was a special source of royal income. This did not, however, save the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Call</ENAMEX> from being burned and looted as persecution mounted in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 14th and 15th centuries</TIMEX>. Just off the carrer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">del Call</ENAMEX>, at carrer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Marlet</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, a medieval inscription in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hebrew</ENAMEX> marks the site of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> founded by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> ‚ÄúRabbi <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samuel Hassareri</ENAMEX>, may his life never cease.‚Äù
Nearby is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baixada de Santa Eul√†lia.</ENAMEX> Just off the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pla√ßa de Sant Felip Neri</ENAMEX>, a tiny and silent square closed to traffic (silent except when the nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> holds recess here). The saint‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> was pockmarked by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> bombs during <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the Civil War</ENAMEX>, though others maintain that firing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">squads</ENAMEX> performed executions here. 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baixada de Santa Eul√</ENAMEX>†lia descends to carrer dels <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Banys Nous</ENAMEX>, named for the long-gone ‚Äúnew‚Äù <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">baths</ENAMEX> of the ghetto erected in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 12th century</TIMEX>. This winding <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>, which more or less follows the line of the old <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> wall, is the unofficial boundary of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barri G√≤tic</ENAMEX>. It is also known as the carrer dels <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">antiquaris¬†‚Äî¬†the headquarters</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antiques</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX>. As you walk along, keep your eyes peeled for unusual hand-painted shop signs, the fretwork of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gothic</ENAMEX> windows, and dusty treasures in the antiques shop windows. You‚Äôll see the old tile signs with a cart symbol high in the walls at some <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">corners</ENAMEX>, the indication of one-way <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>. 
Around the corner is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trio</ENAMEX> of impossibly pretty plazas. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pla√ßa de Sant Josep Oriol adjoins Pla√ßa del Pi</ENAMEX>, on which sits <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santa Mar√≠a del Pi</ENAMEX>, a handsome <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> with a tall octagonal bell <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> and a harmonious fa√ßade pierced by a large <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15th-century</TIMEX> rose window. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúPi‚Äù</ENAMEX> means pine <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>, and there is a small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specimen</ENAMEX> here replacing one that was a landmark in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">past centuries</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Buildings</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pla√ßa del Pi</ENAMEX> show off the sgrafitto technique of scraping designs in colored <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plaster</ENAMEX>, imported from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1700s</TIMEX>. (Barcelona‚Äôs emerging <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">merchant class</ENAMEX> favored such fa√ßades as an inexpensive substitute for the sculpture that was found in aristocratic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palaces</ENAMEX>.) 
These <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">two adjoining</NUMEX> squares, together with the small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Placeta del Pi</ENAMEX> to the rear of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>, are the essence of old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barcelona</ENAMEX> and a great place to while away the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX> with tables spread out <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">under leafy</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> in each of the squares are magnets for young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">travelers</ENAMEX>, who are entertained by roving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">musicians</ENAMEX>. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sundays</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> offer their canvases for sale in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pla√ßa de Sant Josep Oriol</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> that leads north from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pla√ßa del Pi</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">carrer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Petritxol</ENAMEX>, is one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barri G√≤tic‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most traditional. The narrow passageway is lined with art <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">galleries</ENAMEX>, framing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, and traditional granjas¬†‚Äî¬†good stops for pastries and hot <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chocolate</ENAMEX>. Barcelona‚Äôs oldest, and most famous, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">art gallery</ENAMEX> is here: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sala Par√©s</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>.
At carrer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Portaferrisa</ENAMEX>, a left will take you to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">La Rambla</ENAMEX>, while a right turn will take you back near the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cathedral</ENAMEX> and a handful of additional sights on the perimeter of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barri G√≤tic</ENAMEX>. (You could also return to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pla√ßa de Sant Josep Oriol</ENAMEX> and take <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">carrer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de la Palla</ENAMEX>). At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pla√ßa Nova</ENAMEX> near the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">cathedral</ENAMEX> is the modern <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Col.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">legi d‚ÄôArquitectes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">College of Architects</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Picasso</ENAMEX> etched the graffiti-like drawings of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Three Kings</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> bearing palm <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branches</ENAMEX> on the modern fa√ßade. 
The busy pedestrian <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">thoroughfare</ENAMEX> that leads north to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pla√ßa de Catalunya</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Avda</ENAMEX>. Portal d‚ÄôAngel, one of the city‚Äôs main shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>. When there are rebaixas, or sales happening, wading through the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowds</ENAMEX> here is no easy task. Look for the small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> carrer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Montsi√≥</ENAMEX>, which leads to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Els Quatre Gats</ENAMEX> (The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Four Cats</ENAMEX>), a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX> and restaurant that became famous when <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Picasso</ENAMEX> and a group of young <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bohemian intellectuals¬†‚Äî¬†the painters Ram√≥n Casas</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Santiago Rusi√±ol</ENAMEX> among them¬†‚Äî¬†began hanging out here. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Picasso</ENAMEX> had his first public exhibition here in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1901</TIMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX>, one of the first commissions for the modernista <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Puig</ENAMEX> i <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cadafalch</ENAMEX>, preserves its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">turn-of-the-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ambience</ENAMEX>. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Ribera</ENAMEX>
Some of the most beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Gothic</ENAMEX> architecture and most fascinating medieval corners of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barcelona</ENAMEX> actually lie just outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barri G√≤tic</ENAMEX>. To the east of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Via Laietana¬</ENAMEX>†‚Äî¬†a busy avenue roughly parallel to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ramblas</ENAMEX>, cut through the old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1859</TIMEX> to link the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port</ENAMEX> with the modern <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center¬†‚Äî¬†and</ENAMEX> below the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">carrer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de la Princesa</ENAMEX>, which intersects it at midpoint, is the atmospheric <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">quarter</TIMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">La Ribera</ENAMEX>. Here you‚Äôll find both the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Museu Picasso and the majestic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santa Mar√≠a del Mar.</ENAMEX> 
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carrer Argenteria</ENAMEX>, once the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">avenue</ENAMEX> to the sea from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Palace</ENAMEX>, cuts a diagonal swath from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pla√ßa de l‚</ENAMEX>ÄôAngel to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>. Begun in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1329</TIMEX> at the height of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catalonia‚</ENAMEX>Äôs expansion as a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX> power, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Mar√≠a del Mar</ENAMEX> is the greatest example of pure <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Catalan Gothic</ENAMEX>, with unadorned exterior walls, a flat roof, sober fa√ßade flanked by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two three</NUMEX>-tiered octagonal bell <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">towers</ENAMEX>, and a large rose window over the portal. 
The dimensions and extraordinary austerity of the interior are breathtaking. Fires set during the rioting of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1936</TIMEX> at the outbreak of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Civil War</ENAMEX> tragically consumed all the trappings of chapels, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">choir</ENAMEX>, and altar, leaving the interior stripped to its essence. The result is a capacious, lofty <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX> suffused with soft light from the stained-glass windows. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> tall naves are supported by slim octagonal columns set <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">13 meters</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">43 feet</NUMEX>) apart, and the dimensions of the interior are multiples of this distance, achieving a perfect symmetry. Behind the simple modern altar, the columns branch high overhead into the arched vaulting of the apse. The acoustics are excellent, best measured by frequent concerts in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> and the voices of choirboys at mass.
The rear door of the church leads to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Passeig del Born</ENAMEX>, a rustic-looking <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plaza</ENAMEX> where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">jousts</ENAMEX> were held in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Middle Ages</TIMEX> and fairs and festivals take place <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>. Many of the little <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> surrounding the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> are named for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">craftsmen</ENAMEX> who once had their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> here or their products: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sombrerers</ENAMEX> (hatmakers), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mirallers</ENAMEX> (mirror-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">makers</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Esparter√≠a</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">makers</ENAMEX> of rope-soled shoes), and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Espaser√≠a</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">sword-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">makers</ENAMEX>). <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> the area is better known for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">merry-makers</ENAMEX> who swarm its bars late into <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the night</TIMEX> and spill out onto the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>; disgruntled <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> hang signs from their windows pleading with the municipal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> to impose quiet <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX>. 
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barcelona‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">grandest medieval streets</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carrer Montcada</ENAMEX>, populated by aristocrats from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 14th</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16th centuries</TIMEX>, is lined with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gothic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palaces</ENAMEX>, each with an imposing door or arched gate to an inner <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> where an ornamental staircase usually led up to reception <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX>. These <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansions</ENAMEX> were gradually abandoned after the demolition of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">adjoining district</ENAMEX> and construction of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ciutadella</ENAMEX> fortress. The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">quarter</TIMEX> around <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Mar√≠a del Mar</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">decayed</ENAMEX> gently without interference, leaving it the most authentically medieval part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Museu Picasso</ENAMEX>, recently enlarged in grand fashion, is housed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palau Aguilar</ENAMEX>, a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansion</ENAMEX>. It and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palau Castellet</ENAMEX> next-door were acquired by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> to house the collection of paintings, drawings, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ceramics</ENAMEX> donated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Picasso‚</ENAMEX>Äôs lifelong <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaume Sabart√©s.</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> more <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Moncada</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palaces</ENAMEX> have been added to the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Picasso</ENAMEX> stable; they will hold temporary exhibitions. After the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> opened in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1963</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Picasso</ENAMEX> added sketches and paintings from his childhood and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youth</ENAMEX>, as well as the famous <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> variations on the theme of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Las Meninas</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vel√</ENAMEX>°zquez masterpiece in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madrid‚Äôs Prado Museum</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barcelona‚Äôs</ENAMEX> collection is the largest outside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Picasso</ENAMEX> lived and became an international <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">superstar</ENAMEX> after leaving <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barcelona.</ENAMEX>
The earliest works date from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Picasso‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">ninth</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>. As a teenagerhe produced large canvases in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the moralizing 19th-century</TIMEX> realist manner, such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">First Communion and Science and Charity</ENAMEX>. It appears that, as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Picasso‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">talent</ENAMEX> developed, he digested the styles of the past and of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contemporaries</ENAMEX>, proved he could equal them, then forged energetically ahead into the future. Though the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doesn‚Äôt</ENAMEX> possess any of the master‚Äôs finest works, it does have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> good examples of his <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚ÄúBlue Period‚Äù</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1903</TIMEX>), as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Harlequin</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1917</TIMEX>), and the idiosyncratic <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Las Meninas</ENAMEX> series, which provides a fascinating view of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Picasso‚</ENAMEX>Äôs innovative and deconstructivist approach to his subject. 
Across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museu T√®xtil i de la Indument√†ria</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Textile</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Costume Museum</ENAMEX>), in the former <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marqueses de Lli√≥</ENAMEX>. The collection brings to life the elegance enjoyed by the rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> who occupied the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Montcada</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansions</ENAMEX>. The costumes on display are of superb silks, satins, and furs, embroidered and stitched to perfection. Styles represented reach all the way to the flapper dresses of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1920s</TIMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museu Barbier-Mueller</ENAMEX>, in a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montcada</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> an interesting collection of pre-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Colombian</ENAMEX> art. All of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansions</ENAMEX> along this street merit a peek in at the courtyards, but one that‚Äôs always open is the handsome, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baroque Palau Dalmases</ENAMEX>, at Number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>. On the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ground floor</ENAMEX> is an over-the-top, rococo <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Espai Barroc</ENAMEX> (meaning, appropriately, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baroque Space</ENAMEX>). 
Between neighborhoods, up via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Laeitana</ENAMEX> several blocks from carrer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Princesa</ENAMEX>, is one of the city‚Äôs greatest achievements of modernista architecture, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palau de la M√∫sica Catalana</ENAMEX> (on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sant Francesc de Paula</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palace</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catalan Music</ENAMEX>, by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Llu√≠s Dom√®nech i Montaner</ENAMEX>, may be the perfect (albeit chaotic) expression of modernisme. It is an explosion of mosaics, tiles, stained glass, enamel, sculpture, and carving¬†‚Äî¬†a wildly audacious outpouring of contours and colors. The brick exterior, with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moorish</ENAMEX> arches and columns inlaid with floral tile designs, is sober compared to what‚Äôs inside. 
Even though every square inch is embellished, right down to the tiles underfoot, somehow the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall isn‚Äôt overpowering</ENAMEX> or claustrophobic. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dom√®nech‚Äôs</ENAMEX> main <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concerns</ENAMEX> was to let in as much natural light as possible, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX> is indeed light and roomy. The structural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">skeleton</ENAMEX> is iron¬†‚Äî¬†an innovation in those days¬†‚Äî¬†which allows the walls to be of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glass</ENAMEX>. Sunlight streaming in during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> concerts sets the place on fire. On either side of the orchestra‚Äôs stage the rich colors of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> are offset by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> wildly sculpted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of musical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">masters</ENAMEX> in white <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plaster</ENAMEX>. Between these fevered creations of the sculptor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pau Gargallo, Picasso‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX>, the silvery pipes of a grand organ stand in orderly contrast.
Overhead is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palau‚</ENAMEX>Äôs crowning glory, a magical stained glass orb. Behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">musicians</ENAMEX> a curved wall is covered with mosaics of muses playing instruments, from bagpipes to castanets. Their upper bodies are made of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">porcelain</ENAMEX> and seem to emerge magically from the walls. If this all sounds like the recipe for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">nausea</ENAMEX>, you simply have to see it to believe it. The best way to experience the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palau</ENAMEX> is to attend a concert. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX> was built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1908</TIMEX> for a musical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">society</ENAMEX> called the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Orfe√≥ Catal√†</ENAMEX>, but <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> programs range from top symphony <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">orchestras</ENAMEX> and soloists to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">avant-garde</ENAMEX> pop-rock <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outfits</ENAMEX>. Tickets may be purchased at the box office on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">c/ Sant Pere M√©s Alt</ENAMEX>, near the top of via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Laietana</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">Guided tours</ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Catalan</ENAMEX> (just be sure you sign up for the right <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>) are <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10am to 3:30pm</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tel</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">93/268 10 00</NUMEX>). The recent demolition of the undistinguished <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> next the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palau</ENAMEX> is part of a long-awaited expansion plan.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Eixample</ENAMEX> & Modernisme
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eixample, Barcelona‚</ENAMEX>Äôs modern district north of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pla√ßa de Catalunya</ENAMEX>, is the city‚Äôs main shopping and banking area. It‚Äôs where you‚Äôll want to spend a good portion of your time if you‚Äôve been waiting for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gaud√≠.</ENAMEX> The neighborhood is flush with spectacular apartment <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>, examples of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barcelona‚</ENAMEX>Äôs unique <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early-20th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">modernista</ENAMEX> architecture, and is called the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quadrat</ENAMEX> d‚ÄôOr (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Golden Square</ENAMEX>). 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principal</ENAMEX> shopping and strolling <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">avenues</ENAMEX> are the elegant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Passeig de Gr√†cia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barcelona‚Äôs</ENAMEX> version of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Champs</ENAMEX> d‚ÄôElysee, and pedestrian-only <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rambla de Catalunya</ENAMEX>, an uptown segment of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Rambla</ENAMEX>. In a manageable area between the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Gran V√≠a de les Corts Catalanes and Avinguda Diagonal</ENAMEX>, you‚Äôll find most of the modernista masterpieces. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barcelona‚</ENAMEX>Äôs signature sights, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Gaud√≠‚Äôs unfinished cathedral La Sagrada Familia</ENAMEX> and his fantasy-land residential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parque Gu√´ll</ENAMEX>, are on the northern outskirts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eixample</ENAMEX> (easily accessible by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">taxi</ENAMEX> or metro).
For all of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barcelona‚</ENAMEX>Äôs exuberant architecture, the city‚Äôs modern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">district</ENAMEX> is a model of rationalist urban planning, a rigid geometric grid dryly called <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚Äúthe Extension</ENAMEX>.‚Äù The outrageous and conservative, one learns, coexist here without much fuss. 
Barcelona‚Äôs expansion came about in a remarkable burst of urban development. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-1800s</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barcelona</ENAMEX> was bursting at the seams and suffocating inside its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ring</ENAMEX> of medieval walls. A municipal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">competition</ENAMEX> was held in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1859</TIMEX> to select a plan for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a new quarter</TIMEX> between the old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Collserola hills</ENAMEX>. The job went to a road <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineer</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ildefons Cerd√†</ENAMEX>, whose plan quintupled the city‚Äôs size in a matter of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX>. Eixample construction by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elite</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barcelonans</ENAMEX> transformed the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> into a showcase of extravagant modernista architecture, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">swank Passeig de Gr√†cia</ENAMEX> became the place to be seen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barcelona</ENAMEX> used the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">1888 Universal Exposition</ENAMEX> as an open house to show the world its new face.
The place to begin a modernista tour is definitely on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Passeig de Gracia</ENAMEX> and its single, hallucinatory block popularly known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manzana de la Discordia (‚ÄúBlock of Discord‚Äù</ENAMEX>) between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Consell de Cent</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arag√≥</ENAMEX>. (In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Spanish</TIMEX> the word for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúapple‚Äù</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äústreet block‚Äù</ENAMEX> are the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">¬†‚Äî¬†manzana¬†‚Äî¬†allowing</ENAMEX> for a play on words alluding to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">apple</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> mythology, which was awarded to the most beautiful among <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">goddesses¬†‚Äî¬†a</ENAMEX> contest that led inevitablyto trouble.)
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dom√®nech i Montaner‚Äôs Casa Lle√≥ Morera</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1902‚Äì 1906</ENAMEX>), at Number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX>, incorporates <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moorish</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gothic</ENAMEX> elements. This grand <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">corner apartment house</ENAMEX> has suffered the most disfigurement, especially on the ground floor, where the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> leather goods <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Loewe</ENAMEX> installed picture windows and destroyed several original sculptures. The main floor is now occupied by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> that runs the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ruta del Modernisme</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">113</NUMEX>), and guided visits are possible as part of the route. The interior is richly decorated with carvings, mosaics, and stained glass. The dining <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> is enclosed by a riotously colorful semi-circle of stained glass, the work of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Llu√≠s Rigalt</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">Guided tours</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the hour</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">10am‚Äì6pm</ENAMEX>. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Casa Amatller</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1900</TIMEX>), just up the block at Number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41</NUMEX>, was built for a chocolate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Puig i Cadafalch</ENAMEX> drew inspiration from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Flanders</ENAMEX> for the stepped roof covered in glazed tiles. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institut Amatller</ENAMEX> d‚ÄôArt Hisp√†nic on the top floor contains documents on <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanic</ENAMEX> art furniture by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX> and a splendid collection of glass, but is not open to the public except by special permission. If you are discreet, though, you can usually take a peek into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lobby</ENAMEX> to see the antique elevator and wonderful staircase.
Gaud√≠‚Äôs highly personal <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Casa Batll√≥</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1904-1906</TIMEX>) is next door. The curvy contours, unexpected combinations of textures and materials, bright colors, and infinite detail are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gaud√</ENAMEX>≠ hallmarks, as are his prevalent religious and nationalist symbolism. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Casa Batll√≥</ENAMEX> is said to pay tribute to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patron saint</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catalonia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">St.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dragon</ENAMEX> he valiantly slayed. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gaud√≠</ENAMEX> himself left no clues as to his intent. The undulating blue-tile roof indeed looks like a dragon‚Äôs scaly hide, while the window balconies could be the skulls and bones of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> (others have suggested that they are Venetian carnival masks). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. George‚</ENAMEX>Äôs cross and a shaft suggest a spear being thrust into the dragon‚Äôs back. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Casa Batll√≥‚</ENAMEX>Äôs fa√ßade is covered with the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">bits</NUMEX> of broken plate and tile, a decorative technique called trencadis that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gaud√≠</ENAMEX> repeatedly employed. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gaud√≠</ENAMEX> did not actually build the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>; he was commissioned to remodel the exterior and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">interior</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX> cannot be visited, as it is owned by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> that makes <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chup-a-chups</ENAMEX> lollipops, but you can hold a private function in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Gaud√≠‚Äôs emblematic home¬†‚Äî¬†for</ENAMEX> a significant fee, of course.
Farther up and across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>, at Number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">92</NUMEX>, is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Casa Mil√†</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1905‚Äì1910</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Gaud√≠‚Äôs</ENAMEX> masterwork. Known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">La Pedrera</ENAMEX> (which means ‚Äústone <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">quarry</ENAMEX>,‚Äù an allusion to its limestone surface), this stunning apartment <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UNESCO</ENAMEX> World Heritage Site. The sinuous fa√ßade with wonderfully twisted <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wrought-iron balconies bends</ENAMEX> around the corner of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">c/ Proven√ßa</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> was given a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX>-to-toe facelift in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-1990s</TIMEX>, and 
it looks better than ever. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartments</ENAMEX> inside had suffered unspeakable horrors, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gaud√</ENAMEX>≠‚Äôs beautiful arched <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">attics</ENAMEX> had been sealed up, but <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> everything has been restored to its original <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">attic floor</ENAMEX> is now a handsomely realized, high-tech <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gaud√</ENAMEX>≠ <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> (called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Espai Gaud√≠</ENAMEX>). Opened to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late 1999</TIMEX>, was one of the original <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gaud√</ENAMEX>≠ <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartments</ENAMEX>, all odd shapes, handcrafted doorknobs, and idiosyncratic details. It has been meticulously outfitted with period furniture, a great number of the pieces designed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gaud√≠.</ENAMEX> For many, though, the highlight continues to be the wavy rooftop, with its cluster of swirling <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Darth Vader</ENAMEX>-like chimneys and spectacular views of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barcelona</ENAMEX> all the way to the sea. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Pedrera</ENAMEX> had one of the world‚Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> underground parking <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garages</ENAMEX>; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> the space <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> an ampitheater where cultural conferences are held. The building‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">owner</ENAMEX>, the cultural foundation <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fundaci√≥ Caixa de Catalunya</ENAMEX>, has transformed the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX> into a sumptuous exhibition <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">space</ENAMEX> for a variety of impressively curated shows (entrance is free). Tours of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Casa Mil√</ENAMEX>† are given in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Catalan</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily 10am‚Äì8pm</TIMEX>, and they include access to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Espai Gaud√≠</ENAMEX> and rooftop (tel. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">93/484 59 95</NUMEX>). On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer weekend</TIMEX> evenings between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8pm</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midnight</TIMEX> you can enjoy a variety of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cocktails</ENAMEX> and jazz music on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terrace</ENAMEX>.
You‚Äôll likely be busy looking up, or in chic store windows, when you stroll along <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Passeig de Gr√†cia</ENAMEX>, but be sure to notice the ground as well: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gaud√≠</ENAMEX> himself designed the hexagonal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pavement tiles</ENAMEX> with nature motifs. The mosaic benches and iron street lamps with little <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bats</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1900</TIMEX>) are by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pere Falqu√©s.</ENAMEX> 
Additional examples of modernisme, by other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architects</ENAMEX> of the period, are littered throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eixample</ENAMEX> and are too numerous to detail here. Have a look at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Passeig de Gr√</ENAMEX>†cia to the east, especially the carrers <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diputaci√≥, Consell de Cent, Mallorca</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Val√</ENAMEX>®ncia as far as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mercat de la Concepci√≥</ENAMEX> market. In the old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> you‚Äôll stumble across marvelous modernista store fronts, such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Filat√®lia Monge</ENAMEX> stamp shop at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carrer dels Boters</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Antiga Casa Figueras</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bakery</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ramblas</ENAMEX>. To hunt down modernista monuments with even greater accuracy, consider the self-guided tour, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ruta del Modernisme</ENAMEX>; its map details <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barcelona</ENAMEX> modernista.

If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barcelona‚</ENAMEX>Äôs given you‚Äôve the design bug, there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> excellent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> that specialize in design and are well worth a visit, as much for their contents as for the spectacular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">turn-of-the-century palaces</ENAMEX> that house them: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B.D. Ediciones de Dise√±o</ENAMEX>, on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mallorca</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">291</NUMEX>; and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vin√ßon</ENAMEX>, housed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansion</ENAMEX> that once belonged to the famed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painter</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ram√≥n Casas</ENAMEX>, at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Passeig de Gr√†cia</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">96</TIMEX>. See page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">81</NUMEX>.
In addition to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bareclona‚</ENAMEX>Äôs modernista architecture, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Passeig de Gr√†cia</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paseo de Gracia</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish</ENAMEX>) is lined with outdoor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">caf√</ENAMEX>©s, cinemas, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">galleries</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bookstores</ENAMEX>, and elegant fashion <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boutiques</ENAMEX>. A number of the top <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> are on or near this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">avenue</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pla√ßa de Catalunya</ENAMEX>, where the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">boulevard</ENAMEX> begins, was designed to be the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">city‚Äôs hub</ENAMEX>, and it certainly is lively, if not the most attractive space in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barcelona.</ENAMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bus</ENAMEX>, metro, and regional train <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">systems radiate</ENAMEX> from this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>. 
Parallel to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Passeig de Gr√</ENAMEX>†cia is an extension of the old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ramblas</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rambla de Catalunya</ENAMEX>. It is lined with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tapas bars</ENAMEX>, clothing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boutiques</ENAMEX>, and mom-and-pop <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX>; traffic moves slowly down either side, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> is pedestrian-only and is considerably more relaxed than the lower <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ramblas</ENAMEX>. 
On <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">carrer d‚ÄôArag√≥</ENAMEX> between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Passeig de Gr√†cia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rambla de Catalunya</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fundaci√≥ Antoni T√†pies</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> dedicated to the work of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spain‚</ENAMEX>Äôs foremost living <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX>, the abstract materialist from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Catalonia</ENAMEX>. In addition to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T√</ENAMEX>†pies‚Äôs work, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fundaci√≥</ENAMEX> has interesting rotating international exhibits, but <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least half</NUMEX> the reason to visit is to see the gorgeous <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1880</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Dom√®nech i Montaner</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> (one of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> examples of modernisme) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T√</ENAMEX>†pies‚Äôs whimsical, tangled wire sculpture (called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚ÄúCloud</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chair‚Äù</ENAMEX>) on the roof. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Sagrada Familia</ENAMEX>
What the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Eiffel Tower</ENAMEX> is to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Statue of Liberty</ENAMEX> is to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>, the soaring spires of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sagrada Familia</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> are to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barcelona.</ENAMEX> Its unmistakable profile, protruding from the city‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crew</ENAMEX>-cut skyline, is visible from afar. Yet the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> peculiar, cigar-shaped <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">towers</ENAMEX> are merely the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">shell</ENAMEX> of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> that was begun in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1882</TIMEX> and is still <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many years</TIMEX> from completion. This was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Antoni Gaud√</ENAMEX>≠‚Äôs life work, though he didn‚Äôt really expect to finish it in his lifetime. He probably didn‚Äôt expect to be run over by a tram while working feverishly on it, either. 
For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many years</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> remained much as it was when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gaud√≠</ENAMEX> died. With the assistance of private funds, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">foundation</ENAMEX> is now trying to complete the church¬†‚Äî¬†not an easy task, since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gaud√</ENAMEX>≠ left few detailed plans behind. Yet it is known that he meant for a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> more spires to be built.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gaud√≠</ENAMEX>, who died in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1926</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the age of 74</TIMEX>, is appropriately buried in the church‚Äôs crypt. During his last <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> he lived in a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> on the construction site, obsessed with the project. As indisputably original as <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">La Sagrada Familia</ENAMEX> is, it was not Gaud√≠‚Äôs work from the very beginning. He took over the more traditionally <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gothic</ENAMEX> plans of an earlier <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX> and supervised work on the east <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Portal of the Nativity</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX>, and part of the apse and nave. 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">west-side Portal of the Passion</ENAMEX> and its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">towers</ENAMEX> have been under construction since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1952</TIMEX>, with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">builders</ENAMEX> using plans by other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architects</ENAMEX> emulating his style. The east fa√ßade shows best what <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gaud√≠</ENAMEX> intended. Everything has significance and a name, and no space is left unfilled. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> doorways, with stonework dripping like stalactites, represent <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Faith</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hope</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charity</ENAMEX>, and are loaded with sculptures depicting angel choirs and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">musicians</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Biblical</ENAMEX> episodes such as the birth and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youth</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus</ENAMEX>, the Flight into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Slaughter of the Innocents, the Tree of Calvary</ENAMEX>, and much, much more. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">cathedral</ENAMEX> is intended to incorporate every aspect of creation and faith. <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Twelve</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">towers</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> at each portal, are to represent the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apostles</ENAMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> higher ones, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Evangelists</ENAMEX>; a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dome</ENAMEX> over the apse, the Virgin; and the central <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">spire</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Savior</ENAMEX>. Both, an elevator and steps give access to a lookout from one of the east <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">towers</ENAMEX>. 
On the west side is a modern sculptural interpretation, much criticized, that has galvanized those who believed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> should have been left as it was, unfinished, as a tribute to the great <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gaud√≠.</ENAMEX> Nevertheless, onward it goes ¬†‚Äî¬†when it will be finished, nobody knows. For now and perhaps the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> to come, the great spires are marred by ever-present scaffolding and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cranes</ENAMEX>.
A short walk diagonally from <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">La Sagrada Familia</ENAMEX> is the astonishing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau</ENAMEX>, designed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dom√®nech i Montaner</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palau de la M√∫sica Catalana</ENAMEX>) and completed by his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX>. The complex of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">buildings¬†‚Äî¬†still</ENAMEX> a working hospital¬†‚Äî¬†is one of modernisme‚Äôs most underrated (and least known) achievements. 
Farther north, in a working <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> neighborhood on the rising slope of the hills behind <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gr√†cia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parc Gu√´ll</ENAMEX>, another wildly ambitious <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gaud√≠</ENAMEX> project, is a residential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> completely intertwined with nature. Although this project too was never completed according to plan, it is a marvelous place to visit: part <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>, part <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hansel</ENAMEX>-and-Gretel fantasyland. Gaud√≠‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patron</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eusebi G√ºell</ENAMEX> bought <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6 hectares</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">15 acres</NUMEX>) here, overlooking the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> and the sea, intending to create a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> of villas. He gave <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gaud√</ENAMEX>≠ carte blanche to produce something original, and for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next 14 years</TIMEX>, on and off, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX> delighted in letting his imagination run wild. A gingerbread gatehouse <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guards</ENAMEX> the entrance on the carrer d‚ÄôOlot; a tiled lizard fountain gurgles <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> from its jaw; supporting columns mimic tree trunks. Ceilings are decorated with broken plates, and wildly undulating benches are splashed with dizzying broken <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ceramics</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gaud√</ENAMEX>≠‚Äôs beloved <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">trencadis</ENAMEX>.
Beneath the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plaza</ENAMEX> with the benches is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sal√≥ de les Cent Columnes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hall of the One Hundred Columns</ENAMEX>). There actually are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">86</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Doric</ENAMEX> in style, in what was to have been the colony‚Äôs covered market. If you look closely at the ceiling, you‚Äôll see dolls‚Äô <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heads</ENAMEX>, bottles, glasses, and plates stuck in the mosaics.
As a real-estate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">venture</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> failed to attract <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">villas</ENAMEX> were built. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gaud√≠</ENAMEX> lived for a time in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>, with a gold-flecked witch‚Äôs-hat <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX>. It contains a small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> of furniture by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gaud√≠</ENAMEX> and other memorabilia. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Waterfront & Barceloneta</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barcelona</ENAMEX> turned its back on the sea in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th century</TIMEX> and focused on developing industry. The sea wall where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> loved to walk and catch the breeze on stifling <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">summer nights</TIMEX> was dismantled. Access to and even a view of the sea was obstructed by <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">warehouses</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">railway tracks</ENAMEX>. Expansion proceeded towards the hills, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Barceloneta</ENAMEX>, a neighborhood created in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-1700s</TIMEX> between the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX> and the beach, became the district of modest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fishermen</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sailors</ENAMEX>. Now all this has changed again, and a recreational (and increasingly commercial) area has been newly created along the waterfront.
Begin a tour of the waterfront at the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Columbus Monument</ENAMEX>, at the foot of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ramblas</ENAMEX>. To the right is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Les Reials Drassanes</ENAMEX>, begun in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1255</TIMEX>, the only medieval <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shipyard</ENAMEX> still in existence and now the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museu Mar√≠tim</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maritime Museum</ENAMEX>). The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> bays of these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">yards</ENAMEX>, which could once handle <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">more than 30 galleys</NUMEX> at a time, launched <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX> that extended <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catalonia‚</ENAMEX>Äôs dominion over the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tunis</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sicily</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sardinia</ENAMEX>, and much of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> coast. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> contains models of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX>, from the earliest galleys to the cargo and passenger <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX>, that have made <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barcelona</ENAMEX> their home <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port</ENAMEX> up to the present day. The prize exhibit is the full-size copy of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Galley</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">La Reial</ENAMEX>, aboard which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Don Juan</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Austria</ENAMEX> commanded the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">fleet</ENAMEX> that defeated the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turks</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Battle of Lepanto</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1571</TIMEX>. 
Across <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Passeig de Colom</ENAMEX>, the busy <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> on the waterfront, is a wooden <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">footbridge</ENAMEX> called the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rambla del Mar. Designed</ENAMEX> as an extension of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ramblas</ENAMEX> and popular with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> strollers, it crosses over to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moll</ENAMEX> d‚ÄôEspanya and leads to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maremagnum</ENAMEX>, a shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> with an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Imax</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cinema</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">L‚ÄôAqu√°rium de Barcelona.</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Europe‚</ENAMEX>Äôs largest aquariums, its main attraction is a spectacular glass <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tunnel</ENAMEX> on the sea bed. 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port</ENAMEX> is busy with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Yacht Club</ENAMEX>, cruise <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX>, and ferries to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mallorca</ENAMEX>. Overhead, aerial cable <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> link <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Montju√Øc with Barceloneta</ENAMEX>. The newest addition to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Trade Center</ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">I.M. Pei</ENAMEX>-designed complex of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">offices ‚Äúfloating‚Äù</ENAMEX> in the harbor.
Prior to the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Olympics</ENAMEX>, the harbor area was upgraded, transforming the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moll de la Fusta</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wood</ENAMEX>-loading <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">quay</ENAMEX>, into a broad promenade. Once again Barcelonans can stroll by the sea, although almost all the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> that moved in with the refurbishment have gone belly-up (their <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">shells</ENAMEX> have been replaced by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekend</TIMEX> discotheques). A large and convenient parking <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garage</ENAMEX> is located underneath.
Barceloneta
Barceloneta <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">isn‚Äôt</ENAMEX> quite the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚Äúlittle Barcelona‚</ENAMEX>Äù that its name promises. It is separated from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> as much in spirit as by the physical barriers of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> and the rail <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">yards</ENAMEX>. No modernista apartment <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>, no hallowed <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Gothic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrines</ENAMEX> in this shirt-sleeve <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who catch <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cook</ENAMEX> and serve them, eat and drink heartily, and yell back and forth at each other across neighborly <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>. The robust barrio weathered attempts to tame and tether it as part of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX> waterfront sterilization scheme, but it has mostly survived.
A triangle of sand¬†‚Äî¬†the area now bordered by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Passeig Nacional</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Avinguda d‚ÄôIc√†ria</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">beachfront Passeig Mar√≠tim¬†‚Äî¬†first housed dispossessed</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> when the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ribera</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">district</ENAMEX> was demolished to make way for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ciutadella</ENAMEX> fortress. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fishermen</ENAMEX> unload their <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> across the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Passeig Nacional</ENAMEX>, and the catch soon finds its way to the scores of local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>.
At the end of the harbor¬<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">†‚Äî¬†Marina de Port Vell</ENAMEX>, where some huge yachts are <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">moored¬†‚Äî¬†turn</ENAMEX> in a block or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> to the beach. Once dominated by a row of flimsy wooden <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> called chiringuitos (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shacks</ENAMEX>), the area was virtually rebuilt in preparation for the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Olympics</ENAMEX>. Most of the chiringuitos were wiped out, a loss many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Barcelonans</ENAMEX> still feel. The run-down feel of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment blocks</ENAMEX> is still present, but they‚Äôre now mixed with a cluster of elegant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> and several smart bars and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>. An extensive clean-up operation was carried out on the beaches, and a landscaped <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">avenue</ENAMEX> established on the seafront leading to the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Olympic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about a mile</NUMEX> up the coast. 
What served as the athletes‚Äô <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Olympic Village</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vila Ol√≠mpica</ENAMEX>) was planned as an entirely new, planned <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> (it won <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard University</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prince Charles</ENAMEX> design awards). Initially a ghost <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of designer <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartments</ENAMEX>, it has blossomed into a vibrant seaside neighborhood for young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX>. Tourist interest focuses on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Port Ol√≠mpic</ENAMEX>, the new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX>, a lively area of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX> clustered around anchored <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> and yachts, the stretch of landscaped beaches called <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Platjas de Barcelona</ENAMEX>, and the shopping centered around the deluxe high-rise <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hotel Arts</ENAMEX>, which sits imposingly on the beach. 
You can either take a bus or the metro to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Barceloneta</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pla√ßa de Catalunya</ENAMEX>. A sensational ride back is aboard an aerial cable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">car</ENAMEX> ride that traverses the length of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port</ENAMEX>, providing excellent views of the waterfront and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Rambla</ENAMEX>. The ride climbs to the cable-car <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Torre de Jaume I</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">107 meters</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">351 feet</NUMEX>) above the harbor. From there you can descend and walk back to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Columbus monument area</ENAMEX>, or continue the aerial lift to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montju√Øc</ENAMEX> at the level of the amusement <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>.
Lodged between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Port Ol√≠mpic</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">La Ribera</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">district</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Parc de la Ciutadella</ENAMEX>, the city‚Äôs largest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>. The expanse contains the city <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">zoo</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parc Zool√≥gic</ENAMEX> and its rare <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">albino gorilla</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Snowflake</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Copito de Nieve</ENAMEX>), the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museu</ENAMEX> d‚ÄôArt <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Modern</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Modern Art Museum</ENAMEX>), the seat of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parlament de Catalunya</ENAMEX>, and the foundations of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ciutadella</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Citadel</ENAMEX>). It‚Äôs a lovely <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>, with a lake, large old <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>, and pleasant <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pathways</ENAMEX>. The large Baroque fountain, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">La Cascada</ENAMEX>, was designed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Josep Fontser√©</ENAMEX>, who had as his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assistant</ENAMEX> a young architecture <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Antoni Gaud√≠</ENAMEX>. 
The main attraction of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museu</ENAMEX> d‚ÄôArt <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Modern</ENAMEX> is its collection of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19th</NUMEX>- and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 20th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Catalan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">works</ENAMEX>, particularly those of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Modernist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>. There are some notable canvases by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santiago Rusi√±ol</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ram√≥n Casas</ENAMEX>. Other works include those of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Modernist artists Mir and Nonell</ENAMEX>.
In the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">area</ENAMEX> across between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Ribera</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Passeig de Colom</ENAMEX>, which fronts the old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">harbor</ENAMEX> just south of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barceloneta</ENAMEX>, the most remarkable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">La Llotja</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barcelona‚Äôs</ENAMEX> trading activities for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than 600 years</TIMEX>. It started out as an open loggia where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">merchants</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ship</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> made their deals. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 14th century</TIMEX> this was enclosed and expanded to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> naves of slim columns supporting high, round arches. Here was installed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> of ‚ÄúConsulate of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sea</ENAMEX>,‚Äù the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">foundation</ENAMEX> of maritime law for all the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>. With the addition of a neo-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Classical fa√ßade</ENAMEX>, staircase, and upper stories, the building served variously as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chamber of Commerce</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">School of Fine Arts</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">where Picasso</ENAMEX> was a student) before becoming the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barcelona Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Borsa de Barcelona</ENAMEX>). You can visit the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX>, from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9am</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5pm</TIMEX>. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">El Raval</ENAMEX>
The district between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Rambla</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronda de Sant Antoni</ENAMEX>, once the line of the city <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wall</ENAMEX>, is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Raval</ENAMEX>, a neighborhood being rapidly renovated, with many old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> demolished to create open spaces. The best way to venture into the barrio is to start on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ramblas</ENAMEX>, turning west on carrer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">del Carme</ENAMEX>. 
On the site of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Gothic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hospital de la Santa Creu</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hospital</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holy Cross</ENAMEX>), a hospital and refuge for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pilgrims</TIMEX> stood for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a thousand years</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gaud√≠</ENAMEX> died here in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1926</TIMEX>. The present <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> were begun in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1401</TIMEX>. Look for the frieze of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16th-century</TIMEX> tiles on the life of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. Paul</ENAMEX> in the entryway of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institut d‚ÄôEstudis Catalans</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hospital‚Äôs courtyard</ENAMEX> is restful, with benches near orange <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> ripe with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX>. Exhibitions of art and books are held in the various <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">halls</ENAMEX> off the cloister.
Turn north from here up the carrer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">del √Ängels</ENAMEX>, and you will reach the most conspicuous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">symbol</ENAMEX> of the transformation underway in this neighborhood: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Meier‚</ENAMEX>Äôs shockingly modern, and blindingly white, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museu</ENAMEX> d‚ÄôArt <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Contemporani de Barcelona</ENAMEX>, known by its initials, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MACBA</ENAMEX>. Erected as a counterpoint to the rest of the barrio, and as the lead <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> in the municipal government‚Äôs plans to upgrade this artist‚Äôs neighborhood, the stark <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> is worth visiting, primarily for architecture <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buffs</ENAMEX>. It is still working on putting together a serious contemporary collection.
Next door, on carrer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Montalegre</ENAMEX>, is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Centre de Cultura Contempor√</ENAMEX>†nia <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">de Barcelona</ENAMEX>, a striking modern makeover of an old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Casa de Caritat</ENAMEX>. It displays interesting exhibits that posit <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barcelona</ENAMEX>, or the urban experience, as their theme. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> more <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> on this side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ramblas</ENAMEX> that should not be missed is the small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sant Pau del Camp</ENAMEX>, off in a corner of its own at the end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">carrer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Sant Pau</ENAMEX>, which starts at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pla de la Boquer√≠a.</ENAMEX> The simplicity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sant Pau‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Romanesque</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lines</ENAMEX> is an agreeable change from the extravagance of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barcelona‚</ENAMEX>Äôs modernisme and the intricacies of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Gothic</ENAMEX> architecture. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> was almost certainly built in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">ninth</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">century</TIMEX>, as evidenced by the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tomb</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wilfred</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX>, dated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">912</TIMEX>, that was found here. The small, lovely cloister has curious, rather <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX>-style arches. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> usually remains locked; the best time to see the interior is on a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX>.
Montju√Øc
Montju√Øc was the natural site for the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Olympic Ring</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anella Ol√≠mpica</ENAMEX>) of athletic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX>. For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many years</TIMEX> its <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">210-meter</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">689-foot</NUMEX>) summit, panoramic view of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> and harbor, and outstanding complex of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX>, amusement attractions, and sports facilities have made the hill a favorite place to spend <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an afternoon</TIMEX>. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montju√Øc</ENAMEX> came into its own as the site of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Barcelona‚Äôs 1929 International Exhibition</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pla√</ENAMEX>ßa d‚ÄôEspanya‚Äôs ornate fountain was created to grace the entrance to the fairground and is still a good point to begin a visit to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Montju√Øc</ENAMEX>, as it has a metro and bus <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stop</ENAMEX>. A number of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hangar</ENAMEX>-type <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">halls</ENAMEX> used during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> by commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exhibitors</ENAMEX> at fairs line a central pedestrian <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">avenue</ENAMEX> leading upwards to the vast <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palau Nacional</ENAMEX>, the fair‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pavilion</ENAMEX>. 
This domed palace holds <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the world‚Äôs finest collections of medieval art, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museu Nacional</ENAMEX> d‚ÄôArt <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Catalunya</ENAMEX>. Unmatched for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Romanesque</ENAMEX> art and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gothic</ENAMEX> painting of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catalan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>, it has undergone extensive refurbishment over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX>, and the section on <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Romanesque</ENAMEX> art is now finally reopened. From the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">ninth</NUMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 13th centuries</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 2,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX> were built in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Catalonia</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Romanesque</ENAMEX> style of thick, bare walls with rounded arches for doors, windows, and cloisters. Interiors were decorated with frescoes in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Byzantine</ENAMEX> tradition; primitive sculpture of biblical episodes or rural life on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capitals</ENAMEX> of columns; painted altar front panels; carved wooden crosses, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madonnas</ENAMEX> of great purity. Around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the start of the 20th century</TIMEX> many of these works of art were removed to Catalan <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX> that were deteriorating or abandoned, thus saving them from further damage or being sold out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>.
Some of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spain‚</ENAMEX>Äôs very best works of art are in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>, such as the great <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12th century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Cristo Pantocrator</ENAMEX> from the apse of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sant Climent de Ta√</ENAMEX>ºll in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pyrenees</ENAMEX>. A superb <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of unpainted, elongated wooden <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">figures</ENAMEX> representing the descent from the cross is from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santa Mar√≠a de Ta√ºll.</ENAMEX> There are masterpieces in every <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> of this most unusual collection. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gothic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX> is excellent, too. Many of the paintings are retablos, many-paneled screens with Gothic-arched frames that stood behind <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">chapel altars</ENAMEX>. Among the treasures are <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Llu√≠s Dalmau‚</ENAMEX>Äôs Virgin of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Councillors</ENAMEX>, with its portraits, full of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX>, of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicos</ENAMEX> who commissioned the work for the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">City Hall chapel</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1445</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jaume Ferrer</ENAMEX> II‚Äôs stylishly hatted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">St.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerome</ENAMEX>; and a very fine retable of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. John the Baptist</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">saints</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sebastian</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nicholas</ENAMEX>. 
Up the hill and across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museu Arqueol√≤gic</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Archaeological Museum</ENAMEX>). Among the many interesting exhibits drawn mainly from prehistoric, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iberian</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> sites in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Catalonia</ENAMEX> are reconstructions of tombs and life-like dioramas. Around another curve, within walking distance up the hill, is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museu Etnol√≤gic</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ethnological Museum</ENAMEX>). This well-presented collection usually has a special rotating program highlighting the native arts of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latin America</ENAMEX> and other lands. 
Farther up Montju√Øc, turn left where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avinguda de l‚ÄôEstadi</ENAMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Olympic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Ring boulevard</ENAMEX>) becomes the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avinguda de Miramar</ENAMEX>, to see the simple and elegant <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fundaci√≥ Joan Mir√≥</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> was designed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1975</TIMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Josep Llu√≠s Sert</ENAMEX> to house a large collection of paintings, drawings, tapestries, and sculpture by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catalan</ENAMEX> surrealist. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mir√≥</ENAMEX> died in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1983</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the age of 90</TIMEX>. The exhibits follow Mir√≥‚Äôs artistic development from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1914</TIMEX> onwards. Photographs show him always neatly dressed and barbered, looking like a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catalan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">businessman</ENAMEX> in contrast to the more bohemian <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Picasso</ENAMEX>, and in contrast, too, with the surrealist works he created. The collection is witty and bright with the bright colors and unique language symbols associated with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX>. 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avinguda de Miramar</ENAMEX> continues past the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">station</ENAMEX> of the funicular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">railway</ENAMEX> that climbs the hill from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avinguda del Paral</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lel</ENAMEX> near the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paral</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lel</ENAMEX> metro stop. The funicular links up here with a cable <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> that goes to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Parc d‚ÄôAtraccions de Montju√Øc</ENAMEX>, an amusement <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>, and on to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Castell de Montju√Øc</ENAMEX> on the summit. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cable</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> run <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekends</TIMEX>-only in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX>. A short walk from the amusement <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Pla√ßa de</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">l‚ÄôArmada station</ENAMEX> for the cable <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> that crosses the harbor, completing an interesting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> of transport by cable.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fortress</ENAMEX> atop <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Montju√Øc</ENAMEX>, built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1640</TIMEX>, remained in use by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX> and then as a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prison</ENAMEX> until shortly before it was turned over to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> to become a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1960</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museu Militar</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Military Museum</ENAMEX>) has an extensive collection of antique weaponry and armor, lead <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX> of different epochs, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catalan</ENAMEX> castles. Here in a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">basement room</ENAMEX> you‚Äôll find what may be the only statue of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">General√≠ssimo Francisco Franco</ENAMEX> to be seen in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barcelona</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">fort</ENAMEX> has somber <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>: Its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cannons</ENAMEX> bombarded the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> to put down rebellions in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 18th and 19th centuries</TIMEX>, and it was the site of political executions, including that of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Llu√≠s Companys</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Generalitat of Catalonia</ENAMEX> during <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the Civil War</ENAMEX>, who was shot by a firing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">squad</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1940</TIMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Olympic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX>, on the northern side of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montju√Øc</ENAMEX>, are centered on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stadium</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Pla√ßa d‚ÄôEuropa</ENAMEX>. The original <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1929</TIMEX> stadium, now called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Estadi Ol√≠mpic</ENAMEX>, was enlarged for the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Summer Games</ENAMEX>. The handsome, high-tech <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palau d‚ÄôEsports Sant Jordi</ENAMEX> was designed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arata Izozaki</ENAMEX>. It can seat <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17,000</NUMEX> under a roof <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">45 meters</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">148 feet</NUMEX>) high.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Poble Espanyol</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Village</ENAMEX>), on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montju√Øc‚</ENAMEX>Äôs northeastern flank, is an attraction for which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">clich√© ‚Äúfun</ENAMEX> for the whole family‚Äù might have been invented. Built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1929</TIMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barcelona Universal Exposition</ENAMEX>, it‚Äôs a composite of architecture representing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spain‚</ENAMEX>Äôs varied regions, including replicas of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>, church <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">towers</ENAMEX>, fountains, plazas, and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palaces</ENAMEX> built of solid brick and stone. The entrance, through one of the gates of the walled <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of √Åvila, is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step into a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">115</NUMEX> such reproductions arranged along a network of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">alleys</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> squares. It‚Äôs a bit cheeky and full of tour<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">-bus</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowds</ENAMEX>, but at least gives you a notion of the different regions of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>. That said, there‚Äôs plenty to entertain <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>.
Architecture aficionados won‚Äôt want to miss <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> last sight on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montju√Øc</ENAMEX>: the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pabell√≥ Mies van der Rohe</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pavilion</ENAMEX> built for the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">1929 International Expo</ENAMEX> by the seminal minimalist. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glass</ENAMEX>, stone, and steel <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cube house</ENAMEX> is a wonder of cool <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bauhaus</ENAMEX> forms, tucked in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> just off <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Avinguda Marqu√©s de Comillas</ENAMEX>.
The Diagonal
The broad, tree-lined <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avinguda Diagonal</ENAMEX> slices across <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cerd√†‚</ENAMEX>Äôs grid from the coast to the hills. Designed for through traffic, it links up with the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ring roads</ENAMEX> around the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> and the toll <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">highways</ENAMEX> beyond. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">area</ENAMEX> around the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pla√ßa de les Gl√≤ries Catalanes</ENAMEX>, a busy roundabout linking main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX> into the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, is largely industrial, but becomes more dignified to the west after crossing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Passeig de Sant Joan</ENAMEX>. Between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Passeig de Gr√†cia</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pla√ßa de Francesc Maci√</ENAMEX>† is one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barcelona‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most elegant <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">districts</ENAMEX>, with four-star <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> and luxury <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>. Pricey <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">discotheques</ENAMEX> abound in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">adjoining streets</ENAMEX>. 
A <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">couple of miles</NUMEX> west along the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diagonal</ENAMEX>, surrounded by a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>, is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palau Reial de Pedralbes</ENAMEX>, an estate of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G√ºell</ENAMEX> family converted into a royal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1924</TIMEX> in case <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alfonso XIII</ENAMEX> should drop by. It now houses elements of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Museu de les Artes Decoratives</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum of Decorative Arts</ENAMEX>) and a collection of carriages. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX>- and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baroque</ENAMEX>-period paintings from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colecci√≥ Camb√≥</ENAMEX>, formerly in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palau de la Virreina</ENAMEX>, are now hung here. Be sure to go around the park walls to see the dragon gate in wrought iron designed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gaud√</ENAMEX>≠ for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G√ºells.</ENAMEX> 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">districts</ENAMEX> on the hillside beyond were once separate <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barcelona</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> often spent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summers</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekends</TIMEX>. They‚Äôve been gradually absorbed over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barcelona‚</ENAMEX>Äôs expansion, but each still preserves its own unique <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">character</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gr√†cia</ENAMEX>, for example, has its own town <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pla√ßa Rius i Taulet</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Llibertat</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fraternitat</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pla√ßa Revoluci√≥</ENAMEX>, reflecting a political past. There‚Äôs a great night-time blowout of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> and festivity in these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the second half of August</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sarri√†</ENAMEX> retains the feel of a small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Catalan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, while the atmosphere of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pedralbes</ENAMEX> is patrician¬<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">†‚Äî¬†residential villas</ENAMEX> with gardens and the city‚Äôs most expensive real estate. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monestir de Pedralbes</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pedralbes</ENAMEX> has a superb <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gothic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> with a charming <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-story <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cloister</ENAMEX> and part of the excellent Thyssen-Bornemisza art collection, including important works from the medieval to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian Baroque</ENAMEX> periods (the major part of which is housed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thyssen</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX>). 
Tibidabo
The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> bright, clear <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">late afternoon</TIMEX> of your visit, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tibidabo</ENAMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">542-meter</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,778-foot</NUMEX>) peak that overlooks <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barcelona.</ENAMEX> The views of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> are breathtaking. You can clearly make out the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Sagrada Familia</ENAMEX> and the grid plan of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eixample</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Families</ENAMEX> come here on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> evenings to enjoy <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1950s</TIMEX>-style amusement <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekends</TIMEX> are crowded with joggers and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cyclists</ENAMEX>. You can also climb <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Torre de Collserola</ENAMEX>, by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX> Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norman Foster</ENAMEX>, or visit the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sagrat Coraz√≥n</ENAMEX>. A <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">neo-Gothic</ENAMEX> work by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Enric Sagnier</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> is surmounted by a monumental figure of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christ</ENAMEX>, one of the city‚Äôs landmarks.
To reach the summit take the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCG</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX> (not the metro) to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>ÄúAvda. Tibidabo‚Äù from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pla√ßa de Catalunya</ENAMEX>. From here a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tramvia Blau</ENAMEX> (blue tram) runs <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturdays</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sundays the rest of the year</TIMEX>, taking you up to the funicular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX>, past stately <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansions</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five minutes</TIMEX> the funicular (closed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-October</TIMEX> through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February</TIMEX>) lifts you through pine woods to the top, where you have a spectacular panorama of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">sea</ENAMEX> coast, and, on very clear <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>, both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mallorca</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pyrenees</ENAMEX>. There are several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX> here, including <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mirablau</ENAMEX>, with extraordinary views as their selling points.
Excursions
There‚Äôs an awful lot to detain you in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barcelona</ENAMEX>, but just beyond the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> are several sites eminently worthy of day trips, including the holy <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Catalan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrine Montserrat</ENAMEX>, the relaxed beach- and-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> town of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sitges</ENAMEX>, and the cava <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> in the region of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pened√®s.</ENAMEX> 
Montserrat
The jagged ridges of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montserrat</ENAMEX> rise out of the rather featureless <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Llobregat</ENAMEX> plain <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">62 kilometers</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">38 miles</NUMEX>) northwest of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barcelona</ENAMEX>, in the very heart of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catalonia</ENAMEX>. Although the view from its <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,235-meter</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4,051-foot</NUMEX>) summit can encompass both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pyrenees</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mallorca</ENAMEX>, it is more significant that from afar one can see the unmistakable outline that gives <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montserrat</ENAMEX> its name, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚ÄúSerrated Mountain</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù Montserrat</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shrine</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catalan</ENAMEX> nationhood. 
The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> hermitages on the mountain may have been established to escape the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Moorish</ENAMEX> invasion. One was enlarged as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Benedictine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monastery</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 11th century</TIMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A century</TIMEX> later it became the repository of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Moreneta</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Black Madonna</ENAMEX>, said to be a carving by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Luke</ENAMEX> later hidden by <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">St. Peter</ENAMEX>. She‚Äôs a small wooden image of a brown-faced Virgin holding the infant <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus</ENAMEX> on her lap and the globe in her right hand. Ever since, pilgrims‚Äîfrom commoners to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">kings¬†‚Äî¬†have</ENAMEX> climbed the mountain to worship the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catalan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patron saint</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">More than a million</NUMEX> pilgrims and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> visit <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each year</TIMEX>.
Like <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catalan</ENAMEX> nationalism, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monastery</ENAMEX> has been destroyed only to rise again. It was burned to the ground by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Napoleon‚Äôs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1808</TIMEX>, abandoned in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1835</TIMEX> when all convents were sequestered by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, and rebuilt in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1874</TIMEX>. During the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Spanish Civil War</ENAMEX>, when anti-clerical feelings were violent among the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barcelona</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">La Moreneta</ENAMEX> was secretly replaced by a copy; the original remained hidden during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Franco years</TIMEX>. Though <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catalan</ENAMEX> culture was suppressed, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montserrat‚</ENAMEX>Äôs monks continued to say <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">masses</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Catalan</ENAMEX>.
The site of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monastery</ENAMEX> is spectacular, tucked into folds of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rock</ENAMEX> high above the plain. On the eve of the saint‚Äôs day, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27 April</TIMEX>, the monks hold an all-night vigil attended by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowds</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Moreneta</ENAMEX> looks down from a gold-and-glass case above and to the right of the altar in the basilica, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">faithful</ENAMEX> can touch or kiss her right hand through an opening. At <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1pm and 7pm</TIMEX> (except in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July</TIMEX>), the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">choir boys</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Escolan√≠a</ENAMEX>, one of the world‚Äôs oldest music <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>, founded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 13th century</TIMEX>, fill the basilica with their angelic voices. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">congregation</ENAMEX> joins in at the end of the service <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">to sing Montserrat‚Äôs hymn</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Virolai</ENAMEX>, an expression of faith fused with a nationalist fervor.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montserrat</ENAMEX> is also the goal of outdoor sports pilgrims like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cyclists</ENAMEX> (who make the trip from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barcelona</ENAMEX>) and mountain climbers who ascend the spires of rock above the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monastery</ENAMEX>. From the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monastery</ENAMEX> there are walks to other hermitages and a funicular to the cave sacred to the legend of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madonna</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Statues</ENAMEX> and plaques line the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">paths</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montserrat</ENAMEX> is an extremely popular place, so there are several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> set up to feed the hordes. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montserrat</ENAMEX> can be reached in spectacular fashion by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Barcelona‚Äôs Pla√ßa d‚ÄôEspanya</ENAMEX>. On arrival at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montserrat</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">station</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about an hour later</TIMEX>, a cable <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> continues right up the side of the mountain to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monastery</ENAMEX>. A much-less preferable <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bus</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">service</ENAMEX> also operates from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barcelona</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transportes Juli√†</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tel</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">93/490 40 00</NUMEX>). By <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>, leave <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barcelona</ENAMEX> via the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diagonal</ENAMEX> and take the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">highway</ENAMEX>, direction <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tarragona</ENAMEX>, exiting at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sortida</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>.
Sitges
It‚Äôs easy to get to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Costa Daurada</ENAMEX> beaches from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barcelona.</ENAMEX> The coast south of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> earned its name from its broad, golden <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sands</ENAMEX>, in contrast to the rocky coves of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Costa Brava</ENAMEX> to the north. Sitges, a favorite <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barcelonans</ENAMEX>, is the best site for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a day</TIMEX> trip. It‚Äôs a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">43-km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">27-mile</NUMEX>) and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">45-minute</TIMEX> drive, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than half</NUMEX> an hour by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX> from the city‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Estaci√≥-Sants</ENAMEX>.
The coastal drive is a very scenic but narrow and curvy route. If you prefer, you can by-pass this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> by taking the toll <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>, which gets you to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sitges</ENAMEX> in under <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 minutes</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Happily</ENAMEX>, the pretty <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> has escaped the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">high-rises</ENAMEX> and tawdry atmosphere of many coastal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX>, although it does get somewhat overwhelmed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowds</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX>. There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> beaches, separated by a promontory where gleaming <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">whitewashed</ENAMEX> houses cluster around the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sant Bartomeu</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Ribera</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">almost 3 kilometers</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 mile</NUMEX>) long, backed by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promenade</ENAMEX> lined with caf√©s and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>. 
Besides the beaches, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sitges</ENAMEX> is known for its collection of small, appealing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museu Cau Ferrat</ENAMEX> is installed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painter</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Santiago Rusi√±ol</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1861‚Äì1931</ENAMEX>), whose collection of works by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">El Greco, Casas</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Picasso</ENAMEX>, and others is on display, along with many of his own works. Across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Museu Maricel del Mar</ENAMEX> holds a small collection of medieval sculpture and paintings in a splendid <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX> overlooking the sea.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museu Rom√</ENAMEX>†ntic displays the furniture and accoutrements of a wealthy <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th century</TIMEX>, as well as a large <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of antique dolls. On the hillsides and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> are the villas of wealthy <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barcelona</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>, while the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> between the beach and railway <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX> are geared for food and frolic. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late spring</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> are carpeted with <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> for the procession of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corpus Christi</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sitges</ENAMEX> is home to one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spain‚</ENAMEX>Äôs largest gay <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX>, and is a magnet for gay <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">travelers</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year-round</TIMEX>, but particularly during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">carnaval</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gay</ENAMEX> and nudist beaches are just beyond the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> beaches. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sant Sadurn√</ENAMEX>≠ d‚Äô <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anoia</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pened√®s</ENAMEX>)
Cava, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Catalonia‚Äôs sparkling wine</ENAMEX>, comes from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pened√®s</ENAMEX>, a pretty spot <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">40 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">25 miles</NUMEX>) from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barcelona</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about four dozen</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wineries</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> can‚Äôt be too happy about it, but the top-selling sparkling <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">a.k.a. champagne</ENAMEX>) in the world is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catalan</ENAMEX> cava: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cordoniu</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Freixenet</ENAMEX>. The main <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> in the grape-growing region is <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Sant Sadurn√≠ d‚Äô Anoia</ENAMEX>, where <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several</NUMEX> top <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wineries</ENAMEX> are located and offer guided tours and tastings. 
The most interesting is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Codorniu, Spain‚</ENAMEX>Äôs largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">producer</ENAMEX> of cava. The visit to the family-owned <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">winery</ENAMEX> is located on a spectacular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">campus</ENAMEX>, with <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gaud√</ENAMEX>≠ contemporary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Puig i Cadafalch</ENAMEX>. Completed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1898</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Codorniu</ENAMEX> has been declared a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">National Artistic and Historic Monument</ENAMEX>. Besides the modernista architecture, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> embark on a fun theme-park-like cart ride through <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">253/4 km</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">16 miles</NUMEX>) of atmospheric underground cellars.
There are several good <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, which the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Codorniu</ENAMEX> will point out. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">winery</ENAMEX> is open <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year-round</TIMEX> (except <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Year‚Äôs</ENAMEX>), and guided visits in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> are free during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the week</TIMEX>. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sundays</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> receive a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">champagne glass</ENAMEX> along with their tasting, and the visit costs just <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">200 pta</NUMEX>.
