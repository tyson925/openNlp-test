What to Do
Entertainment
Although cultural activity has been under state control since the revolution and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Havana</ENAMEX> no longer sizzles with the sleazy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mafia</ENAMEX>-funded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">casinos</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clubs</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1950s</TIMEX>, both high culture and more down-to-earth nightlife thrive in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX>. Outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX>, it can be hard to pin down whatâ€™s going on where, but informal musical performances are ubiquitous. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX>, nightlife is focused around <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX>, ranging from decent live bands, dance, and fashion shows to mimed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Beatles</ENAMEX> sing-a-longs.
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Live Music Performances</ENAMEX>
Cubans crave live music, andÂ â€”Â with the surge in international popularity of traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cuban</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">musicÂ â€”Â</ENAMEX> so do most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX>. You certainly wonâ€™t have to go out of your way to hear music performances. Roving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">musicians</ENAMEX> can be found playing everywhere from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airports</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>. Merely wandering the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Havana</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santiago</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trinidad</ENAMEX>, youâ€™re likely to stumble across a party with a live <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">band</ENAMEX>, or even a back <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">alley</ENAMEX> where some impromptu jamming is going on. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">nights</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">CamagÃ¼ey</ENAMEX>, the music spreads to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œNoche CamagÃ¼eyaâ€</ENAMEX> block <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> along <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Calle RepÃºblica</ENAMEX>.
All the styles of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cubaâ</ENAMEX>€™s delectable traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">musicÂ ï¿½ï¿½Â habaneras</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX>, boleros, guarachas, guajiras, and moreÂ â€”Â can be heard in every townâ€™s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">casa</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de la</ENAMEX> trova, usually a fine old building on or near the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>. Performances are amateur and professional, take place <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoons</TIMEX> and evenings, and are free or have a minimal cover charge (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">US$1â€“$2</NUMEX>). Especially in the evenings and on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekends</TIMEX>, when youâ€™ll encounter a vibrant mix of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cubans</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreigners</ENAMEX>, the islandâ€™s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">casas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de la</ENAMEX> trova really swing. The most famous is in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santiago de Cuba</ENAMEX> (which has sprung many a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">star</ENAMEX>), while those in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trinidad, Baracoa</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CamagÃ</ENAMEX>¼ey are especially charming.
Aside from traditional acoustic music, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX> revels in salsa and jazz. Probably the best place for live jazz and salsa in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> is the rollicking <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palacio de la Salsa</ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Havanaâ</ENAMEX>€™s slightly dated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hotel Riviera</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paseo y MalecÃ³n</ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vedado</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tel</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">33-4501</ENAMEX>). There, from <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midnight</TIMEX> on, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cubaâ</ENAMEX>€™s very best salsa bands perform (dancing is very much in order), and jazz <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> entertain drinkers in the adjacent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9pm</TIMEX>.
Other music hotspots include:
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Havana</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Casa de la MÃºsica</ENAMEX> (salsa; <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Avenida 35 and Calle 20</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Miramar</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Casa de la Trova</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">San LÃ¡zaro</ENAMEX> between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gervasio</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BelascoÃ¡n</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Central Havana</ENAMEX>), and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">El Zorro y el Cuevo</ENAMEX>, (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">jazz; Calles 23 y O</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vedado</ENAMEX>).
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trinidad</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Casa de la Trova</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HernÃ¡ndez EcherrÃ­</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Casa de la MÃºsica</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calle MÃ¡rquez</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La CanchÃ¡nchara</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calle Villena</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX>), and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Casa Fisher</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calle Lino PÃ©rez</ENAMEX>).
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santiago de Cuba</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Casa de la Trova</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calle Heredia</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Casa de las Tradiciones</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calle General Lacret</ENAMEX>).

Cabaret
A legacy of the high-rolling casino days in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cabarets</ENAMEX> have been kept alive and well as an outlet for tourist dollars. Cavorting mulatta <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dancers</ENAMEX> in sparkling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>-strings and pairs of strategically placed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stars</ENAMEX> may not be most peoplesâ€™ image of socialist doctrineÂ â€”Â but this is <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX> communism. While the best shows (at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Tropicana</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">clubs</ENAMEX> in both <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Havana</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santiago de Cuba</ENAMEX>) are rather expensive by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cuban</ENAMEX> standards, seeing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> big song-and-dance production in the flesh (so to speak) is de riguer.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Tropicana</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Havana</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calles</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">72 and 43</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Marianao</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tel</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">33-7507</ENAMEX>), founded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1939</TIMEX> in a dazzling open-air arena, is indisputably the queen of cabarets. The likes of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nat King Cole</ENAMEX> performed here in pre-revolutionary times. With a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX>-piece <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">orchestra</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cast</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">over 200</NUMEX> (some parading in impossibly large headdresses), the sheer scale of the spectacle will make your head spin. The show regularly kicks off at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:30pm</TIMEX>, and a shorter performance follows <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later</TIMEX>; there are also a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX> and disco. Reservations and transportation can be arranged at your <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">US$60</NUMEX>. You can always visit independently, but the venue, situated in the suburb of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marianao</ENAMEX>, is tricky to find, and you might arrive only to find no tickets remaining. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Havanaâ€™s</ENAMEX> next-best cabaret show, smaller and less expensive, is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cabaret Parisien</ENAMEX>, at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hotel Nacional</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Calles 21 and O</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vedado</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tel</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">30-3564</ENAMEX>), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nightly</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10:30pm</TIMEX>; admission is <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">US$35</NUMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Tropicana</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santiago de Cuba</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Autopista Nacional</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">km 1.5</TIMEX>, with signs from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plaza de la RevoluciÃ³n</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tel</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4-3036</ENAMEX>) fills an enormous, recently constructed <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> on the cityâ€™s northern outskirts. It is no less impressive than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Havanaâ</ENAMEX>€™s but a bit less gaudy. Admission is <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">US$30</NUMEX>, including a drink (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$27</NUMEX> if purchased from a travel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>).
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Varadero</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cabaret Continental</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hotel Internacional</ENAMEX> (shows <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nightly</TIMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:30pm</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3am</NUMEX>) pales in comparison with the former venues but is nonetheless an enjoyable and sometimes fairly raunchy song-and-dance extravaganza. A fun <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">showÂ â€”Â kind</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afro</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cuban</ENAMEX> with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pirate themeÂ â€”Â followed</ENAMEX> by disco takes place in a cave at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cueva del Pirata</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">some 9 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6 miles</NUMEX>) east of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Varadero</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Autopista Sur</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">km 11</TIMEX>), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nightly</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10:30pm until the wee hours</TIMEX>. There is also a cabaret at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MeliÃ¡ Varadero</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Discos</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Discos pulsate</ENAMEX> to both <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Latin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Euro</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> rhythms. The places to be are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Habana CafÃ©</ENAMEX> (the disco in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Havanaâ€™s Hotel MeliÃ¡ Cohiba</ENAMEX>) and the disco in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santiagoâ</ENAMEX>€™s eponymous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX>. These are glitzy affairs, where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreigners</ENAMEX> get soaked and approached by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hustlers</ENAMEX> of all stripes. Also try <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El GaleÃ³n</ENAMEX>, in a make-believe <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pirate ship</ENAMEX> that sets sail from under <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Havanaâ</ENAMEX>€™s <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">La CabaÃ±a</ENAMEX> fortress. The best in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Varadero</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Bamba</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hotel Tuxpan</ENAMEX> (entrance <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">US$10â€“$15</NUMEX>). Also try the open-air <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Discoteca La Patana</ENAMEX>, near the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX> into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Varadero</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trinidad, Motel Las Cuevas</ENAMEX> has a disco with live entertainment, but it pales in comparison to the music <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">halls</ENAMEX> in town. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Guardalavaca</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">open-air</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">La Roca</ENAMEX>, set just above the beach.
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bars</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CafÃ</ENAMEX>©s
Both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX> and cafÃ©s are places to have a mojito, daiquiri, or shot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ron</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rum</ENAMEX>), smoke a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cohiba</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">andÂ â€”Â usuallyÂ â€”Â</ENAMEX> hear some live <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cuban</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rhythms</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Havana</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX> not to miss are <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hemingway</ENAMEX> haunts: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Bodeguita del Medio</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Floridita</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Enjoyable cafÃ©-bars</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Havana</ENAMEX> include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CafÃ© de Paris</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Obispo</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Ignacio</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CafÃ© Oâ€™Reilly</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oâ€™Reilly</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Ignacio</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Montserrate</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avenida de BÃ©lgica</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ObrapÃ­a</ENAMEX>), and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Patio</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plaza de la Catedral</ENAMEX>). Several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> also have good <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hotel Sevilla</ENAMEX> (made famous in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Graham Greeneâ€™s Our Man</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Havana</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hotel Inglaterraâ</ENAMEX>€™s rooftop <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hotel Havana Libreâ€™s Turquino</ENAMEX> (with amazing views from the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">25th</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX>).
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Varadero</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Bar Calle 13</ENAMEX> (on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avenida Primera</ENAMEX>) is the place to meet the jinetera of your dreams. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santiago de Cuba</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terrace</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX> on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">7th</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hotel Casa Granda</ENAMEX> has splendid views and live music. A good place for a cold <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beer</ENAMEX>, paid in pesos, is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Taberna Dolores</ENAMEX>, which usually has live music in its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX>. At the corner of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calle Calvario</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CafÃ© Isabelica</ENAMEX>, a venerable <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24-hour</TIMEX> bohemian haunt in a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three centuries old</TIMEX>. Itâ€™s the kind of place where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cubans</ENAMEX> seem to hook up in a matter of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">seconds</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baracoaâ€™s Hotel Castillo</ENAMEX> has a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX> with sensational views and frequent live music.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Classical Repertoire</ENAMEX>
The classical arts are greatly valued in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX>, and drama, opera, classical recitals, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">andÂ â€”Â above allÂ â€”Â ballet</ENAMEX> can be enjoyed in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">theaters</ENAMEX> all around <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Opulent</ENAMEX>, old-fashioned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">theaters</ENAMEX> such as those in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cienfuegos</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CamagÃ¼ey</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matanzas</ENAMEX>, not to mention <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Havanaâ€™s magnificent Gran Teatro</ENAMEX>, are sights in their own right. The best way to learn whatâ€™s on is to visit the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">theater</ENAMEX>; performances are frequently limited to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekends</TIMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gran Teatro</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Havana</ENAMEX>, at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calles Prado</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Rafael</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tel</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">61-2360</ENAMEX>), has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> main concert <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">halls</ENAMEX> and puts on a wide repertoire of entertainment, from opera recitals to ballet. It is home to the internationally renowned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ballet Nacional de Cuba</ENAMEX>; if you hear that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> (or the rather more innovative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ballet de CamagÃ¼ey</ENAMEX>) is performing, be sure to snap up tickets. Havanaâ€™s <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">International Ballet Festival</ENAMEX> is held during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last week of October</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">first week of November</TIMEX>.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santiago de Cuba</ENAMEX>, try to see the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ballet FolklÃ³rico Cutumba</ENAMEX>, a renowned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">troupe</ENAMEX> that delves into the world of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afro</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cuban</ENAMEX> spirituality and ritual. When in town, they perform at several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">theaters</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shopping</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX> has a reputation as a place where thereâ€™s little worth buying. You will see incredibly barren peso <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">shopsÂ â€”Â window</ENAMEX> displays with bottles of cooking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX>, shoe polish, and a few plumbing parts. But there are plenty of things for dollar-wielding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> to buy now that private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enterprise</ENAMEX> is permitted on a limited scale. Tops on most peopleâ€™s lists are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cubaâ</ENAMEX>€™s greatest achievements (not including the national health care <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX>): cigars, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rum</ENAMEX>, and music. There is also an excellent selection of handicrafts available at excellent prices in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> and resorts frequented by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX>. Tourist markets are now thriving in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cubaâ</ENAMEX>€™s major <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX>, even if much of what youâ€™ll find is related to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Che GuevaraÂ â€”Â berets</ENAMEX>, T-shirts bearing his countenance, and dolls, among many other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">â€œrevolutionaryâ€ items</ENAMEX>.
As for essentials, hotel and dollar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> carry <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mineral water</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">soap</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">shampoo</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">toothpaste</ENAMEX>, but many medicinal or cosmetic staples are hard to come by; itâ€™s still best to bring all you need from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tiendas Panamericanas</ENAMEX> are well stocked dollar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX>, but probably the most impressive dollar store in all <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harris Bros. Company</ENAMEX>, a multistory (itâ€™s got an escalator!) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enterprise</ENAMEX> near the landmark <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Art Deco BacardÃ</ENAMEX>­ <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">capitol</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cuban</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> are now an uneasy mix of sad peso <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> and bright dollar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, with an influx of goods most <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cubans</ENAMEX> can only dream about (indeed, youâ€™ll see large crowds of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> peering dreamily into shop windows). The uneven divide between <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">communist</ENAMEX> ideals and materialist longings is one of the great contradictions in contemporary <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Browsing</ENAMEX> along shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> proves endlessly fascinating, though, and provides profound insights into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cubaâ</ENAMEX>€™s arcane economy.
Souvenirs to Buy
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cigars</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rum</ENAMEX>. The biggest bargain in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX> is probably a coveted box of premium cigars, which at home might cost <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> times more. Cigar <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factories</ENAMEX> open to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> have affiliated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> selling all brands of cigars; the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">PartagÃ¡s factory</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Havana</ENAMEX> has a particularly good <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop</ENAMEX>. You can also purchase cigars at such <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Havana</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Casa del Tabaco</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calle Obispo</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bernaza</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Casa del Habano</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calle Mercaderes</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">120</NUMEX>), at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hotels</ENAMEX>, and at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Youâ€™ll</ENAMEX> find <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Habanos</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> in several other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> and resorts (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trinidadâ</ENAMEX>€™s is on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lino PÃ©rez</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">296</NUMEX>).
Bottles of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rum</ENAMEX> also offer big savings. All tourist-oriented and hotel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> sell <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rum</ENAMEX>, whether aged <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">from three to six years</TIMEX> (aÃ±ejo) or low-grade aguardiente (from sugarcane <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX>) with humorous labels. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Havana Club</ENAMEX> is the brand of choice. Above <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Floridita</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Havanaâ€™s Casa del Ron</ENAMEX> has the islandâ€™s most impressive selection of rums, including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundred</NUMEX>-dollar vintages, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half a dozen</NUMEX> national brands, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rum</ENAMEX> flavored with grenadine, peppermint, or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">banana</ENAMEX>. The dutyfree <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX> also has an extensive selection.
When buying cigars or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rum</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bear</ENAMEX> in mind the customs limits in your home <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">108</NUMEX>).
Music recordings. Compact discs and cassettes of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cuban</ENAMEX> music are widely available, and the selection is now much improved. If youâ€™re in the market for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cuban</ENAMEX> recordings, look for CDs on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">EGREM</ENAMEX> label, available in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARTEX</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> (as well as others) across <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX>. Most are <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">US$15</NUMEX> each. Recommended recordings include those by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Trio Matamoros</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Benny MorÃ©</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Vieja Trova Santiaguero</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Zafiros</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Cuarteto Patria</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Van Van</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pablo MilanÃ©s</ENAMEX>, just to name a very few of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cubaâ</ENAMEX>€™s excellent roster of popular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">musicians</ENAMEX> who will help you keep the fire burning back home. Musical instruments such as maracas, clavÃ©s, and bongos also make good presents.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Handicrafts</ENAMEX>. Local arts and crafts vary from tacky figurines to pleasant drawings of street scenes and postmodernist portraits. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Youâ€™ll</ENAMEX> also find evocative posters and black-and-white photos of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fidel</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Che</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>. Fine handmade lace and crochet are available, principally in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trinidad</ENAMEX>. Those nostalgic for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the old days</TIMEX> might want to pick up a guayabera, the classic <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cuban</ENAMEX> pleated, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-pocket shirt, worn untucked (occasionally you can even stumble across vintage <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">linen</ENAMEX> versions). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boutique QuitrÃ­n</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Obispo es</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Ignacio</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Old Havana</ENAMEX>) has the nicest <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">cotton</ENAMEX> versions of the original white guayabera. Much of the silver-plated jewelry is also a good buy, but you should refrain from acquiring anything with black <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">coralÂ â€”Â itâ€™s</ENAMEX> endangered and illegal to import in many <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>.
There are more interesting things to buy in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Old Havana</ENAMEX> than in the rest of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX> put together. A lively open-air crafts market, with provocative art, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afro</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cuban</ENAMEX> and santerÃ­a dolls, exotic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">woodcarvings</ENAMEX>, and hats made from stripped palm <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">leaves</ENAMEX>, is staged <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> east of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cathedral plaza</ENAMEX>, between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TacÃ³n</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canal</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plaza de Armas</ENAMEX> is busy with second-hand book <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendors</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Intriguing</ENAMEX>, hole-in-the-wall arts and crafts <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> are concentrated along <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Calle Obispo</ENAMEX>. The excellent <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palacio de la ArtesanÃ­a</ENAMEX> (at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Calle Cuba</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">64</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PeÃ±a Pobre y Cuarteles</ENAMEX>), in a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansion</ENAMEX>, is a souvenir <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">supermarket</ENAMEX> in a fine old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansion</ENAMEX>.
Outside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Havana</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trinidad</ENAMEX> has the best array of crafts <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. Several <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> just south of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Plaza</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mayor</ENAMEX> (around the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">casa</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de la</ENAMEX> trova), known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Candonga</ENAMEX>, stage a vibrant <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> crafts market, and youâ€™ll find a good government-run crafts <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calle SimÃ³n BolÃ­var.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santiago de Cubaâ</ENAMEX>€™s crafts mecca is among the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendors</ENAMEX> along <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Calle Heredia</ENAMEX>. The selection, though, is generally poorer than in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Havana</ENAMEX>.
Sports
Watersports
Watersports <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enthusiasts</ENAMEX> are in luck in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX>. Virtually every <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> offers windsurfing, sailing, jet skis, and waterskiing. As anywhere in the world, motorized sports are expensive. Watersports <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> are almost always affiliated with a particular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX>, but anyone may rent the equipment.
Diving is the area of greatest interest and growth. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX> claims to be surrounded by one of the worldâ€™s largest coral reefs, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 1,000</NUMEX> sunken <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">wrecks</ENAMEX>. There are so many tropical <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> (angel <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>, grouper, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">parrot fish</ENAMEX>, moray eels) and sponges that it can feel like swimming in an aquarium. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Facilities</ENAMEX> are generally excellent, and prices are the lowest in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX>. Nearly every <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> professional diving <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> equipped with all the requisite equipment, from oxygen <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">tanks</ENAMEX> to wetsuits. Most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> offer week-long diving <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX> for an internationally recognized qualification (such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMAS</ENAMEX> or PADI) as well as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two-day</TIMEX> introductory courses.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Dozens</NUMEX> of dive sites can be reached from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX>, typically <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a half-hour</TIMEX> boat journey away. The diving <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">El Colony Hotel</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Isla de la Juventud</ENAMEX> offers the best <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> and diving, but it isnâ€™t well suited to beginners. There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">54</NUMEX> designated sites, including caves, wrecks, and what is claimed to be the tallest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">coral</ENAMEX> column in the world. Resorts catering to all levels of ability include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Playa Santa LucÃ­a</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MarÃ­a la Gorda, Cayo Largo, Varadero, Playa GirÃ³n</ENAMEX> (with good diving directly off the shore), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Playa AncÃ³n, Cayo Coco</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guardalavaca</ENAMEX>.
Deep-sea fishing is one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cubaâ</ENAMEX>€™s great attractions, though as of yet not well known (or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-fished). Trips leave from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">islandâ€™s resorts</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Havanaâ€™s Hemingway Marina</ENAMEX> in search of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">marlin</ENAMEX>, wahoo, and swordfish. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Playas del Este, Varadero</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cayo Largo</ENAMEX> are other places that offer excellent fishing expeditions. In addition, there are offshore expeditions for smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">fry</ENAMEX> such as tarpon, sea bass, and mackerel. For freshwater fishing, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hanabanilla</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zaza</ENAMEX> (near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sancti SpÃ­ritus</ENAMEX>) lakes both hold impressively big, copious large-mouth bass.
For information on fishing excursions, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contact</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Puertosol</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calle Cobre</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3404</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Villa Marina</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Havana</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tel</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">33-3510</ENAMEX>).
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spectator Sports</ENAMEX>
The national sport is <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">baseball</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">bÃ©isbol</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cuban</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> are among the best in the world (and several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stars</ENAMEX> have defected to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> major leagues). While <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> improvise with a stick and a makeshift ball in every townâ€™s open spaces, the main <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> have vast <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stadiums</ENAMEX>. It can be difficult to find out exactly when a game is taking place; you should simply ask around.
Activities for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Children</ENAMEX>
At <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX>, water-loving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">babies</ENAMEX> will be happy; those ages <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> and up will be able to join in many of the activities. A few <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort hotels</ENAMEX> (such as those at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cayo Coco</ENAMEX>) have childrenâ€™s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clubs</ENAMEX>, and top <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> can arrange babysitting. Outside the resorts the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> are limited, transportation can be problematic, and feeding fussy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> might present difficulties. But <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cubans</ENAMEX> adore <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and will certainly make a fuss over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yours</TIMEX>. Traveling with young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX> can be a <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">remarkableÂ â€”Â and eye-openingÂ â€”Â experience.</ENAMEX> If you travel with very young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, be sure to take all the diapers and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX> food you require, as these items are hard to find in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX>. If traveling by rental car, you should also supply your own <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> seat.
