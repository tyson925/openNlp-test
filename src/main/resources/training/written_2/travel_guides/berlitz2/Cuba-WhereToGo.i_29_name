Where to Go
To the surprise of many first-time <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX> is no speck in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NicolÃ¡s GuillÃ©n</ENAMEX>, the nationâ€™s finest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poet</ENAMEX>, described the island as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œlong green alligator</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€ Long</ENAMEX> it certainly is, at <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,250 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">776 miles</NUMEX>) from snout to tail. Nearly the size of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX> is divided into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">provinces</ENAMEX> and incorporates <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">some 1,500</NUMEX> offshore islands, known as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cayos (â€œcaysâ€</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">â€œkeysâ€</ENAMEX>).
Given its size, you would need <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least a month</TIMEX> to explore <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX> fully. Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> begin their journeys in the capital, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Havana</ENAMEX>, before heading to the prized tobacco lands farther west and doubling back across the plains of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sugar cane</ENAMEX> and some of the countryâ€™s finest colonial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> in central <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX>. The eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX>, known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oriente</ENAMEX>, has soaring mountains and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cubaâ</ENAMEX>€™s <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> and most musical <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santiago de Cuba</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Resort hotels</ENAMEX> hug quintessential <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX> beaches around the whole island, and though many package <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> still stick close to the coasts, every region has charming, engaging <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sand</ENAMEX> and sun <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX> certainly has, but most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> who dare to step away from the beach will find it simply too beguiling to spend a whole holiday lying idly in front of their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Havana</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Habana</ENAMEX>)
The islandâ€™s capital, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost 3 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhabitants</ENAMEX>, is one of the most intoxicating <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> in the world. Ever since its early maritime <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> and through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1950sÂ â</TIMEX>€”Â when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gangsters</ENAMEX> who ran prostitution and gambling rackets made <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Havana</ENAMEX> synonymous with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">decadenceÂ â€”Â it</ENAMEX> has always held a slightly seedy, languorous allure. That nostalgic appeal is still evident.
Today <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Havana</ENAMEX> is a one-of-a-kind, fascinating study in decay. Unrestrained ocean waves and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">salty sea</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spray</ENAMEX> have wrecked huge chunks of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MalecÃ³n</ENAMEX>, the sumptuous promenade and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roadway</ENAMEX> that traces the edge of the sea. Throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, crumbling houses <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three and four</NUMEX> stories tall, somehow still standing, line backstreets where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> play stickball and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandparents hover</ENAMEX> around doorstoops. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Old Havana</ENAMEX>, magnificently restored colonial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palaces</ENAMEX> and stately baroque <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX> and convents <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX> pulsating squares. Once the finest colonial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Americas</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Havanaâ</ENAMEX>€™s grandeur has not been destroyed even by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX> of crisis and neglect. No less defiant than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Castro</ENAMEX> himself, beneath the rubble this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> is a living, breathing, vital, and sensual <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">creature</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Havana</ENAMEX> sprawls over <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">more than 700 square km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">270 square miles</NUMEX>) and is divided into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">districts</ENAMEX>. Those of greatest interest are <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Habana Vieja</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Old Havana</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Centro Habana</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Central Havana</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vedado</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">andÂ â€”Â to</ENAMEX> a lesser extentÂ<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL"> â€”Â Miramar</ENAMEX>. The latter <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">districts</ENAMEX> are newer residential and shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">barrios</ENAMEX> that extend west and south of the old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. While most areas within a neighborhood can be covered comfortably on foot, passing from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to the other usually requires a taxi or bicitaxi; the latter is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cubaâ</ENAMEX>€™s <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bicycle taxi</ENAMEX>, a type of pedicab.
Old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Havana</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Habana Vieja</ENAMEX>)
The oldest section of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Havana</ENAMEX> is the cityâ€™s most spectacular, even if restoration work and gleaming coats of pastel colonial colors (plus a stern police presence on every corner) are leaving parts of it with a slightly more sanitized feel than the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">weathered</ENAMEX> working class neighborhoods that extend along the water and inland. As the location of the cityâ€™s greatest historical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Old Havana</ENAMEX> is where youâ€™ll want to spend most of your time if it is limited.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Havana</ENAMEX> was founded along a vast natural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">harbor</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1519</TIMEX>. During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16th century</TIMEX> a fleet of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">galleons</ENAMEX> laden with treasures used the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port</ENAMEX> as a pit stop on the way back to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New World</ENAMEX>. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th century</TIMEX> pirate attacks prompted the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> of extensive city <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">defensesÂ â€”Â colossal forts</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> across the harbor mouth, and prominent <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> wallsÂ<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL"> â€”Â making Havana the â€œBulwark</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">West Indies</ENAMEX>.â€
The wealthiest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> lived with their slaves in grand <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansions</ENAMEX> constructed in mudÃ©jar style, a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX> architectural tradition dating from medieval <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>. Hidden courtyards bathed in penumbral light lurked behind massive doors, slatted blinds, carved iron window <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX> (rejas), and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-moon stained-glass windows (mediopuntos).
The presence of such architectural wonders, no matter how dilapidated, led <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UNESCO</ENAMEX> to declare <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Old Havana</ENAMEX> a World Heritage Site in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1982</TIMEX>. In the central <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">tourist quarter</TIMEX>, an expanding number of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> are being spruced up with the assistance of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UNESCO</ENAMEX> and foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">foundations</ENAMEX>, but many others are propped up by wooden columns, lean-tos that appear to be merely forestalling the inevitable. Their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arcades</ENAMEX>, fluted pillars, and mosaic tiles are teetering on last legs, praying for restoration miracles. At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> the deep darkness of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> is punctuated only by the neon glow of TV sets from tiny front <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> and the occasional headlights of a small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX> of gas-guzzling vintage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chevrolets</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plymouths</ENAMEX>.
Havanaâ€™s distant era lives on. Legendary places plucked from the pages of popular novels and the lives of fiction <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> need little input from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> to evoke their storied past: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Graham Greeneâ</ENAMEX>€™s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hotel Sevilla</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">â€œOur Man in Havanaâ€</ENAMEX> went to meet his secret service contact, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hemingwayâ</ENAMEX>€™s favorite watering holes (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Floridita</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Bodeguita del Medio</ENAMEX>) and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hotel Ambos Mundos</ENAMEX>, where he penned much of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">For Whom the Bell Tolls</ENAMEX>.
Old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Havana</ENAMEX> is best experienced on foot, although you can also pick up a bicitaxi (pedicab) to get to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MalecÃ³n</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX> at the districtâ€™s edge.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Plaza de la Catedral</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Havanaâ€™s delicious Cathedral Square</ENAMEX>, the focus of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Habana Vieja</ENAMEX> life, could be a stage set. Most days a colorful crafts market spreads across the cobbled <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> linger at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">El Patioâ</ENAMEX>€™s outdoor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cafÃ</ENAMEX>©, sipping mojitos and tapping their toes to a sampling of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cuban</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX>. The <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">all-hours</TIMEX> hubbub here is infectious. The glorious baroque faÃ§ade and asymmetrical belltowers of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late 18th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">cathedral</ENAMEX> are only marginally the squareâ€™s top attraction. Yet the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>, begun by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jesuits</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1748</TIMEX>, is a thing of beauty; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one half</NUMEX> expects its bells to erupt in triumphant song. Its clean interior is surprisingly plain, but it once held the remains of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Christopher Columbus</ENAMEX>. Just south of the cathedral are superb colonial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansions</ENAMEX> with bright shutters and mediopuntos, and an attractive little cul-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">de</ENAMEX>-sac (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CallejÃ³n de Chorro</ENAMEX>) with a graphic arts <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">workshop</ENAMEX>.
Of particular interest in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Cathedral Square</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Museo de Arte Colonial</ENAMEX>, housed in a handsome palace dating to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1720</TIMEX>. Its yellow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX> and little-altered architectural features are complemented by a large collection of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17th- and 18th-century</TIMEX> furniture.
Just round the corner, on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calle Empedrado</ENAMEX> (at no. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">207</NUMEX>), youâ€™ll find the atmospheric <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bar-restaurant</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">La Bodeguita del Medio</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41</NUMEX>), which according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hemingway</ENAMEX> served <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Havanaâ</ENAMEX>€™s finest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mojito</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> apparently believes the notoriety is worth <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">an extra two dollars</NUMEX> per drink). Like pilgrims to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ernestâ</ENAMEX>€™s drinking <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrine</ENAMEX>, all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> seem required to pay their respects here. Art exhibitions are held down the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Centro Cultural Wilfredo Lam</ENAMEX> (at the corner of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Ignacio</ENAMEX>), named for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cubaâ</ENAMEX>€™s top modern <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX>. Books, manuscripts, and photographs of the countryâ€™s best-known <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">novelist</ENAMEX> are housed inside the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Centro de PromociÃ³n Cultural Alejo Carpentier</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Empedrado</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">215</NUMEX>).
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Plaza de Armas</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Plaza de Armas</ENAMEX>, which surrounds a statue of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patriot</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CÃ</ENAMEX>©spedes and is ringed by shaded marble benches and second-hand booksellers, is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Havanaâ</ENAMEX>€™s oldest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>. It dates to the cityâ€™s founding in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1519</TIMEX>.
On the squareâ€™s eastern side a small neoclassical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Templete</ENAMEX>, marks the spot where the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catholic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mass</ENAMEX> was celebrated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1519</TIMEX>. Next door is one of the cityâ€™s most luxurious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hotel Santa Isabel</ENAMEX>. The squat but angular and moated <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Castillo de la Real Fuerza</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fort of the Royal Forces</ENAMEX>), to the north, is one of the oldest forts in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Americas</ENAMEX>, begun in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1558</TIMEX>. The battlements afford good views over the harbor, and there are craft <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> upstairs. The bronze <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">La Giraldilla</ENAMEX> weather vane on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fortâ€™s towersÂ â€”Â depicting</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> scanning the seas for her lost <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>, an early <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cuban</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">governorÂ â€”Â</ENAMEX> has been adopted as the symbol of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> and of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Havana Club</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rum</ENAMEX>.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1791</TIMEX> the seat of government and the governorâ€™s (or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">captain</ENAMEX> generalâ€™s) <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX> were transferred from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">fort</ENAMEX> to the newly built, baroque <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Palacio de los Capitanes Generales</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Palace of the Captain Generals</ENAMEX>) on the squareâ€™s western <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">flank</ENAMEX>. A magnificent structure that was the presidential <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> and then the municipal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> until <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Castro</ENAMEX> seized power, it now houses the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museo de la Ciudad de la Habana</ENAMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum of the City</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Havana</ENAMEX>). Beyond the serene <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX> and its statue of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Columbus</ENAMEX> lie a succession of splendid <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">marbled</ENAMEX> and chandeliered <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX>, some housing old cannonballs and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coaches</ENAMEX>, others decked out in gilded furnishings. The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">most hallowed</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> commemorates <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cubaâ</ENAMEX>€™s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19th-century</TIMEX> independence wars, with the very <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cuban</ENAMEX> flag and venerated personal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generals</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX>.
Calle Obispo
Running all the way from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Plaza de Armas</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parque Central</ENAMEX>, the pedestrian-only <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calle Obispo</ENAMEX> is Old Havanaâ€™s most important <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">thoroughfare</ENAMEX>. Here you can peer into apothecaries unchanged since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th century</TIMEX> as well as some of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Havanaâ</ENAMEX>€™s oldest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX>. Equally fascinating are the two parallel, partly residential <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streetsÂ â€”Â Oâ€™Reilly</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ObrapÃ­aÂ â€”Â where</ENAMEX> grand neoclassical and colonial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> intermingle with decrepit tenements.
Much of restored <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Old Havana</ENAMEX> is concentrated in only a few blocks at the eastern end of these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>. On the corner of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mercaderes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Obispo</ENAMEX> is the recently renovated, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1920s</NUMEX>-era <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hotel Ambos Mundos</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hemingway</ENAMEX> lived on and off in room <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">511</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of years</TIMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1930s</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> contains original artifacts from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hemingwayâ</ENAMEX>€™s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many years</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX>, including the typewriter he used to write most of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">For Whom the Bell Tolls</ENAMEX> (those not staying in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX> can visit the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">US$2</NUMEX>).
Nearby are several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX> worth visiting as much for the glorious colonial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansions</ENAMEX> that house them as for their contents. On <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calle ObrapÃ­a</ENAMEX>, between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mercaderes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">San Ignacio</ENAMEX>, is the striking lemon-yellow <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Casa de la Obra PÃ­a.</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">This 17th-century</TIMEX> architectural wonder features baroque additions around a flower-drenched <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX> and a full set of beautifully furnished domestic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">owner</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cubaâ</ENAMEX>€™s most important <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>, rescued orphan <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> and took them into his <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">homeÂ â€”Â his obra pÃ­a</ENAMEX> (work of piety) that lends its name to both the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>. The massive mansion opposite, nearly as impressive, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Casa de Ãfrica</ENAMEX>, with pelts, drums, costumes, carved figures, and furniture from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 26</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>, as well as a tantalizing collection of objects related to santerÃ­a, the syncretic Afro-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cuban</ENAMEX> religion (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Casa de Ãfrica</ENAMEX> will likely be closed for renovations until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of 2000</TIMEX>).
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museo NumismÃ¡tico</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calle Oficios</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>) has a comprehensive set of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cuban</ENAMEX> coins and banknotes. A little farther on lies the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Casa de los Ãrabes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calle Oficios</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>), a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moorish</ENAMEX>-style <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> that now comprises a bazaar piled high with carpets, robes, and pottery; Havanaâ€™s only place of worship for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslims</ENAMEX>; and a lovely restaurant tucked away in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Havana</ENAMEX> are a living <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> of chrome-finned wondercars imported during <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Detroitâ</ENAMEX>€™s heyday, but several that once belonged to pivotal <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cuban</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">figuresÂ â€”Â</ENAMEX> among them a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1918</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">truck</ENAMEX> used by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fidelâ</ENAMEX>€™s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cheâ</ENAMEX>€™s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1960</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chevrolet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Bel AirÂ â€”Â are</ENAMEX> lined up in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Museo de Autos Antiguos</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calle Oficios</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>).
Continuing west along <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Calle Oficios</ENAMEX>, youâ€™ll come to a splendidly restored <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Plaza de San Francisco</ENAMEX>, with upscale <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, and the imposing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Iglesia y Convento de San Francisco de AsÃ­s</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">convent</ENAMEX> contains a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> treasures, and you can climb the belltower for spectacular views of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Old Havana</ENAMEX>. Concerts are frequently held here. Nearby, youâ€™ll find several impeccable colonial-era <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> with brilliantly colored faÃ§ades.
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Plaza Vieja</ENAMEX>
Follow charming <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calle Mercaderes</ENAMEX> to the fascinating and aptly named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Plaza Vieja</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Old Square</ENAMEX>), which began life in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1584</TIMEX> housing wealthy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">merchants</ENAMEX>. It is slowly receiving a massive facelift, with assistance from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UNESCO</ENAMEX>, but most of its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansions</ENAMEX> remain in terrible disrepair. Laundry <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">adorns disintegrating balconies</ENAMEX>, while in the center of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plaza</ENAMEX> an incongruous, neoclassical gleaming marble fountain has been installed (itâ€™s an unmitigated disaster in this atmospheric corner of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Old Havana</ENAMEX>). On the southwest corner of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>, a fine <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> has been converted into an arts <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>. Just east is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Art Nouveauâ€“style</ENAMEX>, fabulously decayed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hotel Palacio</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vienna</ENAMEX>, a ghost <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> if ever there was one.
The old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">backstreets</ENAMEX> here are full of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> but seldom visited by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX>. Down <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Calle Cuba</ENAMEX>, between <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sol</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Luz</ENAMEX>, stands <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Convento de Santa Clara</ENAMEX>, an expansive <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> that takes up several blocks. Inside is a tranquil <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard garden</ENAMEX> full of exotic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">convent</ENAMEX> until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1919</TIMEX>, it is now an architectural conservation <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">center</ENAMEX>. It is also a hostel, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Residencia AcadÃ©mica Santa Clara</ENAMEX>, which provides peaceful, simple <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">128</NUMEX>); a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> have long-term stays on their minds.
By the train <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX>, between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calles Picota</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Egido</ENAMEX>, is the modest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Casa Natal de JosÃ© MartÃ­</ENAMEX> (at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calle Leonor PÃ©rez</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">314</NUMEX>), the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">birthplace</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poet</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">statesman JosÃ© MartÃ­.</ENAMEX> The numerous personal effects on display leave no doubt about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MartÃ</ENAMEX>­â€™s importance in the pantheon of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cuban</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heroes</ENAMEX>: he is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cubaâ</ENAMEX>€™s founding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>. The train <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX> itself is fascinating, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> waiting in line and a parking lot full of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bicycle</ENAMEX>-driven pedicabs and vintage <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">taxis</ENAMEX>.
The Prado
West of the oldest sections and intimate <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Old Havana</ENAMEX> is an area of wide boulevards and grand <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palaces</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">loveliest avenue</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prado</ENAMEX> (formally known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paseo de MartÃ­</ENAMEX>), runs from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parque Central</ENAMEX> to the sea. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grand</ENAMEX> but run-down <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>, with fading flamingo-pink and lime-green faÃ§ades and ornate columns, flank a raised promenade of laurels, gas lamps, and marble benches. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th century</TIMEX> this was the cityâ€™s most fashionable strolling ground. Now it serves as a minipark for habaneros (as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Havanaâ</ENAMEX>€™s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> are called), from coupling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lovers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> playing on homemade skateboards to parading <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prostitutes</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> Brasil and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ObrapÃ</ENAMEX>­a lead directly west to the monumental <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Capitolio</ENAMEX>, a replica of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">capitol</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">D.C.</ENAMEX> Completed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1929</TIMEX>, it reflects the period when <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX> was in the thrall of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. Its vast bronze doors pictorially chart the islandâ€™s history, and the immense main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">gallery</ENAMEX> inside has a diamond in the floor beneath the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dome</ENAMEX>, symbolizing that now-distant <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">era</TIMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX> was rich.
Directly behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Capitolio</ENAMEX> is the large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PartagÃ¡s Tobacco Factory</ENAMEX>, the biggest export <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factory</ENAMEX> in the countryÂ â€”Â with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 200</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rollers</ENAMEX> churning out <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5 million</NUMEX> cigars a yearÂ â€”Â and one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Havanaâ</ENAMEX>€™s top tourist draws. This <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factory</ENAMEX>, which has been rolling out puros since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-19th century</TIMEX>, is the best (and, with an admission fee of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">US$10</NUMEX>, the most expensive) to visit on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX>; it also has an excellent tobacco <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop</ENAMEX> and smoking <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lounge</ENAMEX> for aficionados and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wannabes</ENAMEX>. There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> tours <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">81</NUMEX>). If the cigars inside strike you as too expensive, youâ€™ll have plenty of opportunity to purchase fake or stolen stogies outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factory</ENAMEX>, as every <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> whispers â€œYou want cigar?â€ as you pass.
Just east of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Capitolio</ENAMEX>, on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Parque Central</ENAMEX> near the classic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hotel Inglaterra</ENAMEX>, stands the magnificent <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gran Teatro</ENAMEX>, built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1837</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">home</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cuban</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Ballet</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Opera</ENAMEX> drips with ornate balustrades, shutters, and sculpted columns. The cavernous interior is hardly less awesome but can only be visited during performances.
Those with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hemingway</ENAMEX> bug shouldnâ€™t miss a visit to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Floridita</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41</NUMEX>), at the intersection of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calles Obispo</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Montserrate</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">block</ENAMEX> east of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parque Central</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> immortalized the swanky <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Islands</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Stream</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hemingway</ENAMEX> photos adorn the walls, his seat is on the extreme left of the elegant mahogany <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX>, and his favorite daiquiri is now referred to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">as the â€œPapa Hemingway</ENAMEX>,â€ with double <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rum</ENAMEX> and no sugar (everyone knows he was an alcoholic; the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">barmen</ENAMEX> claim he was also diabetic). If you donâ€™t mind sipping a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$6 daiquiri</NUMEX> (the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</TIMEX> wage of the doorman), the place is eminently capable of evoking the kind of hedonistic refuge expat <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> adore.
Housed in the grand presidential <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> used by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">presidents</ENAMEX> (and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dictators</ENAMEX>) <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1920 and 1959</TIMEX>, the fascinating and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">didactic Museo de la RevoluciÃ³n</ENAMEX> is the countryâ€™s largest and most interesting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Youâ€™ll</ENAMEX> find an exhaustive exhibit of the trajectory of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1959</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Cuban Revolution</ENAMEX>, so allow <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a couple of hours</TIMEX> to view it. The most absorbing sections chart the struggle to power with a variety of illustrations: countless maps, evocative photos of both torture <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> and triumphal scenes, and assorted personal memorabilia from passports to bloodstained clothes. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> outside is the ordinary-looking <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Granma</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> that carried <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Castroâ</ENAMEX>€™s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">81</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rebels</ENAMEX> to shore in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1956</TIMEX>; it is now enclosed in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glass</ENAMEX> and guarded by military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX>.
On the seafront (at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CÃ¡rcel</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museo Nacional de la MÃºsica</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Music Museum</ENAMEX>) is of interest mainly for its extensive, informative collection of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> drums and the many stringed instruments used in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cuban</ENAMEX> traditional music.
Havanaâ€™s Forts
Cubaâ€™s most impressive forts sit brooding over the capitalâ€™s commercial harbor. Take a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">taxi</ENAMEX> through the road <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tunnel</ENAMEX> underneath the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> to reach them. The older <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>, constructed at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the 16th century</TIMEX>, is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Castillo de los Tres Santos Reyes Magos del Morro</ENAMEX>, better known as <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">â€œEl Morro</ENAMEX>.â€ From its position at the harbor mouth, the views of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Havana</ENAMEX> over the defiant cannons are magical.
The vast <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fortaleza de San Carlos de la CabaÃ±a</ENAMEX> (known as <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">â€œLa CabaÃ±aâ€</ENAMEX>), running beside the harbor, was constructed after the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> capture of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Havana</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1763</TIMEX>. The largest fort ever built in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Americas</ENAMEX>, it is impressively well preserved, and the gardens and ramparts are romantically lit in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the evening</TIMEX>. A ceremony at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">9pm</NUMEX> re-enacts the firing of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cannon</ENAMEX> that marked the closing of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> gates.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Havana</ENAMEX>
The walls surrounding <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Old Havana</ENAMEX> were razed during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th century</TIMEX> to allow the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> to expand westward. The <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">long, curvaceous</TIMEX>, and crumbling <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">MalecÃ³n</ENAMEX> (breakwater), a six-lane highway alongside the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">cityâ€™s</NUMEX> north shore, links the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">districts</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Central Havana</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vedado</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victim</ENAMEX> of harmful <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt spray</ENAMEX>, the seafront drive is now more a seafront dive. At its eastern end, primary-colored <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">buildingsÂ â€”Â a showcase</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">tragic splendorÂ â€”Â seem</ENAMEX> to fall apart before your eyes. Havanaâ€™s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youth</ENAMEX> congregate along the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MalecÃ³n</ENAMEX> on fine evenings, flying kites, necking, swimming off the rocks, and setting out to sea in giant inner tubes to fish.
Although most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> will want to concentrate on historic and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>-like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Old Havana</ENAMEX>, the newer districts provide a fascinating view of the areas where most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> live and work. The most interesting <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">districts</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Havana</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Central Havana</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vedado</ENAMEX>. The former is a congested, lower-middle-class barrio with few attractions for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>, although a walk along its dusty <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> and crumbling faÃ§ades can be an eye-opening experience. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vedado</ENAMEX> is the cityâ€™s principal commercial and residential zoneÂ â€”Â the epicenter of middle-class <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">HavanaÂ â€”Â with</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX>, monuments, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">theaters</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Havana</ENAMEX>. Once the stomping grounds of the elite in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1950s</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œsuburbâ€</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Miramar</ENAMEX> today is home to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> of rich foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> investing in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX> and the diplomatic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">missions</ENAMEX> of foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX>.
Central <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Havana</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Centro Habana</ENAMEX>)
Central <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Havana</ENAMEX> is a ramshackle residential and commercial area. The cityâ€™s main shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Calle San Rafael</ENAMEX>, traverses it from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parque Central</ENAMEX> westward. This might be <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Havana</ENAMEX> at its least guarded. While having a fascinating stroll here, you can stop to have your nails painted, or get a shave and a haircut, all right on the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pavement</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the countryâ€™s new private markets has overrun <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Havanaâ</ENAMEX>€™s small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chinatown</ENAMEX>, at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calles Zanja</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rayo</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amazingly</ENAMEX>, even downtrodden <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Central Havana</ENAMEX> is being transformed by the presence of glittering dollar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX>.
The neighborhood known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cayo Hueso</ENAMEX>, just behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MalecÃ³n</ENAMEX>, is a rough-and-tumble <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">barrio</ENAMEX> once populated by cigar-factory <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> the main reason to visit is to check out <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calle Hamel</ENAMEX>, where the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salvador GonzÃ¡lez</ENAMEX> has dedicated himself to preserving the areaâ€™s Afro-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cuban</ENAMEX> culture. The small alleyway, the scene of a good many photo shoots, is entirely done over in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> art and graffiti. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GonzÃ¡lez</ENAMEX> has his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">studio</ENAMEX> here, and on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sundays</TIMEX> at around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1pm</TIMEX> there are performances of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afro</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cuban</ENAMEX> ritual and rumba.
Vedado
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vedado</ENAMEX> had its heyday in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1940s and 1950s</TIMEX>, when such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gangsters</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Meyer Lansky</ENAMEX> held sway in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nacional</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Riviera</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Capri</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX>. Such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stars</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Sinatra</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ginger Rogers</ENAMEX> performed, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> emptied their wallets in glittering <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">casinos</ENAMEX>. The revolution put the lid on the nightlife by banning gambling and deporting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mafiosi</ENAMEX>.
Save for the stately, elegant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hotel Nacional</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">129</NUMEX>), overlooking the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MalecÃ³n</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> here have now seen better <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vedado</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Havanaâ</ENAMEX>€™s most respectable business district as well as a leafy residential area, spacious and orderly in comparison with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Old</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Central Havana</ENAMEX>.
Business is centered on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Rampa</ENAMEX>, the name for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Calle 23</NUMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calle L</ENAMEX> to the sea. Opposite the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX>-block <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hotel Habana LibreÂ â€”Â the Havana Hilton</ENAMEX> in pre-revolutionary daysÂ â€”Â is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coppelia</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice cream</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>. At this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locals queue</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> for the prized <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice cream</ENAMEX>, eating several scoops in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> sitting or ladling them into saucepans to take home. Hard-hearted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreigners</ENAMEX> paying in dollars down their scoops in a cordoned-off area. Coppelia was instrumental in the award-winning <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cuban</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">film</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fresa y Chocolate (â€œStrawberry</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chocolateâ€</ENAMEX>), a daring film about freedoms and revolutionary fervor in contemporary <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Havana</ENAMEX> (its title is a wry reference to the lack of choices of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice cream flavorsÂ â€”Â indeed</ENAMEX>, of all thingsÂ â€”Â in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX>).
A short walk up the hill brings you to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Havana</ENAMEX>, founded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 18th century</TIMEX>, a quiet, attractive campus of neoclassical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>. English-speaking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> eager to meet <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreigners</ENAMEX> are numerous here. Directly east on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Calle San Miguel</ENAMEX>, between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calles Ronda</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">MazÃ³n</ENAMEX>, is the fine and surprising <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museo NapoleÃ³nico</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansion</ENAMEX> boasts not only <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Empire</ENAMEX> furniture but also a remarkable collection of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Napoleonic</ENAMEX> memorabilia: busts, portraits, and even his <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pistol</ENAMEX>, hat, and death mask from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Helena</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and contents were acquired by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> from a rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owner</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1960</TIMEX>.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the same year</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> acquired the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museo de Artes Decorativas</ENAMEX>, at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Calle 17</ENAMEX> between <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Calles D</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E.</ENAMEX> Each <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> in this grand <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">villa</ENAMEX> is furnished in a particular style: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">English Chippendale</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX>, baroque, or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Art Deco</ENAMEX> in the fabulous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bathroom</ENAMEX>.
Vedadoâ€™s top sight, though, is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cementerio de CristÃ³bal ColÃ³n</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Columbus Cemetery</ENAMEX>). Massive marble mausoleums line the principal avenues of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cemetery</ENAMEX>, a vast <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of the dead established in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 1800s</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cubans</ENAMEX> come to pray and place <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tomb</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">La Milagrosa (â€œThe Miracle Workerâ€</ENAMEX>), who helps <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in need. It is said that she was buried with her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infant</ENAMEX> at her feet, but when their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> were exhumed, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> was found cradled in her arms.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Plaza de la RevoluciÃ³n</ENAMEX>
The barren district known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plaza de la RevoluciÃ³n</ENAMEX> is worth visiting only for a brief glimpse of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> of the same name, a vast concourse where political rallies are held. Hideous high-rise ministry <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> erected in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1950s</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Batista</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">giant</ENAMEX>, tapering concrete obeliskÂ â€”Â looking like a rocket launch pad with a pensive <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">JosÃ© MartÃ</ENAMEX>­ at its footÂ â€”Â provide the scenery. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Ministry of the Interior</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>, adorned by a giant iron sculpture-mural of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Che</ENAMEX>, is where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fidel Castro</ENAMEX> supposedly punches the clock.
Miramar
More attractive is the exclusive suburb of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Miramar</ENAMEX>, to the west. The villas of the pre-revolutionary rich, expropriated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, have now been divided into <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartments</ENAMEX> or turned into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>. But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">embassies</ENAMEX> along <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Avenida 5</ENAMEX> still imbue the area with a leisurely, privileged feel.
At the corner of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Calle 14</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museo del Ministerio del Interior</ENAMEX> has some intriguing exhibits relating to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> espionage, including code boxes concealed in briefcases, decoding equipment, and a transmitter hidden in a fake rock. Donâ€™t miss the towering <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Embassy</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between Calles 62 and 66</NUMEX>, looking for all the world like a giant concrete robot.
Growing as an <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">attractionÂ â€”Â literallyÂ â€”Â</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maqueta de Habana</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Calle 28</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">113 e/Avenida 1 y 3</ENAMEX>), a scale model of the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> in astounding <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>:1,000 detail. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Havana</ENAMEX> is so expansive that a visit to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maqueta</ENAMEX> can help organize the cityâ€™s neighborhoods in your mind.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Havanaâ€™s Outskirts</ENAMEX>
Havanaâ€™s suburbs are sprawling and grimy, but they contain a couple of places associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ernest Hemingway</ENAMEX> that are magnets for those seeking to trace the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Nobel Prize</ENAMEX> winnerâ€™s life in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">From 1939 to 1960</TIMEX> he lived on and off in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Finca VigÃ­a</ENAMEX>, now the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Casa Museo de Ernest Hemingway</ENAMEX>. The sight is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">11 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">7 miles</NUMEX>) southeast of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Havana</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco de Paula</ENAMEX>, so you will have to take a taxi. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Visitors</ENAMEX> may not enter the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">graceful bungalow villa</ENAMEX>, but by peering through windows and doors you can see all the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> furnished as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> had them, covered in bullfighting posters and filled with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 9,000</NUMEX> books, including such titles as <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Guide to Hunting and Fishing</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX>. You can roam the lush gardens searching out his motorboat, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pilar</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hemingway</ENAMEX> kept the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pilar</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6 miles</NUMEX>) to the east of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Havana</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CojÃ­mar</ENAMEX>, the probable model for the settlement in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Old Man</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sea</ENAMEX>. Next to a diminutive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fort</ENAMEX> in the little townâ€™s old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">corner</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hemingway</ENAMEX> bust, looking out over the bay. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> frequented <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Terraza</ENAMEX> restaurant nearby (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">138</NUMEX>), worth visiting for its many photographs of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hemingway</ENAMEX> in action. Still kicking after all these <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">98-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gregorio Fuentes</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hemingwayâ</ENAMEX>€™s fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">companion</ENAMEX> and the inspiration for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SantiagoÂ â€”Â the â€œOld Man</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">â€ Heâ</ENAMEX>€™s likely to be hanging out at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Terraza</ENAMEX> and, for a few bucks or a few <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drinks</ENAMEX>, will tell tales of his times with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Papa</ENAMEX>.
Farther east, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">approximately 18 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">11 miles</NUMEX>) from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Havana</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Playas del Este</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eastern Beaches</ENAMEX>) are less charming but a big draw for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cubans</ENAMEX> unable to afford much in the way of beach vacations. These beaches are acceptable for a short break from city life, but you are unlikely to want to spend your <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">holiday</TIMEX> here. The long, sandy beaches are excellent but often buffeted by winds.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pinar del RÃ­o Province</ENAMEX>
Due west of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Havana</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pinar del RÃ­o</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Cubaâ€™s westernmost regionÂ â€”Â a</ENAMEX> finger of land with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gulf of Mexico</ENAMEX> to the north and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX> to the south. It contains some of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cubaâ</ENAMEX>€™s most beautiful countryside among the lush <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Guaniguanico mountains</ENAMEX> and surrounding patchwork of lushly verdant fields (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">vegas</ENAMEX>), where the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">worldâ€™s finest tobacco</ENAMEX> is cultivated. In the beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">ViÃ±ales valley</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tobacco</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">fields</ENAMEX> and ancient limestone formations produce spectacular scenery more reminiscent of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southeast Asia</ENAMEX> than the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX>. In this resolutely agricultural <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX>, oxen tilling red-earth fields and cowboy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peasants</ENAMEX> (guajiros) on horseback are much more common than <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX>. Residents of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Havana</ENAMEX> might think of it as a poor backwater, but the easy, almost somnolent pace, breathtaking countryside, and welcoming <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pinar del RÃ</ENAMEX>­o make it one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cubaâ</ENAMEX>€™s certain highlights.
There are beaches and excellent diving farther west, near <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Playa MarÃ­a la Gorda</ENAMEX>, but for most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> the star attractions are the irresistible <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ViÃ±ales</ENAMEX> and its beautiful valley. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> take organized daytrips of the region from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Havana</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX>, but an overnight stay in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">ViÃ±alesÂ â€”Â</ENAMEX> overlooking the valleyÂ â€”Â is highly recommended.
Start your explorations by driving west on the autopista (highway) linking <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Havana</ENAMEX> with the provinceâ€™s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pinar del RÃ­o.</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">About 63 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">39 miles</NUMEX>) along the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">highway</ENAMEX>, a turnoff leaves the level, palm-dotted plains for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Soroa</ENAMEX>, where a richly endowed botanical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garden nestles</ENAMEX> in the mountain foothills near a tired little tourist complex. A guided tour reveals an orchid garden, lychee and mango <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>, and splendid specimens of jagÃ¼ey and ceiba <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">villa of Castillo de las Nubes</ENAMEX> on a nearby mountain has stunning views.
At the end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">highway</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">175 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">109 miles</NUMEX>) west of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Havana</ENAMEX>, the small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pinar del RÃ</ENAMEX>­o is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a bustling</NUMEX> commercial center. Along the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calle JosÃ© MartÃ­</ENAMEX>, low-rise neoclassical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> in blues, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">yellows</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">greens</ENAMEX>, and orange have a stately but dilapidated quality. In <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">backstreet</ENAMEX> houses <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> make homemade cigars; youâ€™ll find a small, interesting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tobacco</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factory</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francisco Donatien FÃ¡brica de Tobacos</ENAMEX>, housed in an old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">jail</ENAMEX> below the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plaza de la Independencia</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Visitors</ENAMEX> are welcome here and at the less picturesque <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Casa Garay Rum Factory</ENAMEX>, on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Avenida Isabel Rubio</ENAMEX>, where they make a local <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rum liqueur</ENAMEX> called guayabita <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">del Pinar</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> southwest from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Juan y MartÃ­nez</ENAMEX> leads deep into tobaccoâ€™s <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">heartlandÂ â€”Â the Vuelta AbajoÂ â€”Â</ENAMEX> where the worldâ€™s greatest tobacco is grown. Amid fields of big green leaves ripening in the sun and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plantations</ENAMEX> covered in canvas sheets stand wooden tobacco <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">barns</ENAMEX>. Here, <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">leaves</ENAMEX> are hung on poles with a needle and thread and then dried, turning from green to brown.
Some <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">27 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">17 miles</NUMEX>) to the north of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pinar del RÃ­o</ENAMEX> lies the most picturesque corner of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX>. The deeply green <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ViÃ±ales valley</ENAMEX> is spattered with mogotes, sheer-sided limestone <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">masses</ENAMEX> covered in thick vegetation. Remnants of an underwater plateau that collapsed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Jurassic</ENAMEX> period, they are part of a geological formation <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least 150 million years old</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tobacco</ENAMEX> (of slightly lesser quality than in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vuelta Abajo</ENAMEX>) grows here in a patchwork of fields and dries in bohÃ­os, constructed with shaggy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">thatch</ENAMEX>. Cigar-chomping guajiros in enormous straw hats urge on their oxen, while vultures swoop overhead. At any time of day you can wander into the fields and meet the modest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX>, who might smother you with hospitality (cigars, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX>, and so forth) and pose for photos.
At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Casa del Veguero</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carretera</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ViÃ±ales</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">km 25</TIMEX>) youâ€™ll find the grizzled <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmer</ENAMEX> â€œEl <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NiÃ±o,â€</ENAMEX> whom the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> has unofficially appointed the face of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">tobaccoÂ â€”Â Cubaâ</ENAMEX>€™s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marlboro</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>. Next to his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">farm</ENAMEX>, on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ViÃ±ales</ENAMEX>, is a state-owned tobacco and souvenir <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop</ENAMEX>. The best valley views can be had from either of its lovely and economical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Jazmines</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Ermita</ENAMEX>. The sight at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">dusk</TIMEX> is especially alluring.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ViÃ±ales</ENAMEX> is surprisingly spruce, with a fetching, arcaded main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> and lovely rustic scenes down the back <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX>. Next to the paladar (a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX> in a private home) and across from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cupet</ENAMEX> gas <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX> is a delightful botanical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garden</ENAMEX>, overseen by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elderly women</ENAMEX> whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> began planting the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of species of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX>.
Nearby, a couple of local tourist sights, on all the package excursions, have curiosity value but little else. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> limestone mogote <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">just</NUMEX> west of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> was painted by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workmen</ENAMEX> dangling on ropes in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s</TIMEX> with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mural de la Prehistoria</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mural of Prehistory)Â â€”Â commissioned</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Castro himselfÂ â€”Â that</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">120 meters</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">370 feet</NUMEX>) high and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">180 meters</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">550 feet</NUMEX>) long. The garish painting, an exercise in bad judgment and sloppy execution, depicts evolution from an ammonite to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dinosaur</ENAMEX> to advanced (and presumably socialist) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Homo sapiens</ENAMEX>. Just to the north of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, the extensive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cueva del Indio</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indian Cave</ENAMEX>) was used as a hideout by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indians</ENAMEX> after the conquest. A tour through the cave includes a brief ride on an underground river in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> (which would-be <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emigrants</ENAMEX> once stole for an unsuccessful escape attempt to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX>). Both mural and cave have decent tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">About 4 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2.5 miles</NUMEX>) north of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ViÃ±ales</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cueva del ViÃ±ales</ENAMEX> is a curious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX> and disco carved out of a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">cave; amazingly</ENAMEX>, itâ€™s open <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cayo Largo</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Isle of Youth</ENAMEX>
The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> main islands in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">ArchipiÃ©lago de los Canarreos</ENAMEX>, south of western <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX>, could not be more different. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cayo Largo</ENAMEX> is a tourist enclave where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> are never more than <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a few yards</NUMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sugar</ENAMEX>-white <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sands</ENAMEX>. Yet itâ€™s an antiseptic place, devoid of any <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cubans</ENAMEX> except those who work there. By contrast, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Isle of Youth</ENAMEX> sees virtually no <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> except those at the rather isolated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hotel El Colony</ENAMEX> (on the small islandâ€™s southwestern tip), who come exclusively for the superb diving at a nearby beach.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cayo Largo</ENAMEX>, an island <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">25 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">15.5 miles</NUMEX>) long and the most easterly of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">ArchipiÃ©lago de los Canarreos</ENAMEX>, might be your <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX> paradiseÂ â€”Â if all youâ€™re looking for is a dazzling white beach and clear blue seas. Other than the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">miles</NUMEX> of beaches, thereâ€™s not much else of consequence here except mangrove, scrub, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half a dozen</NUMEX> comfortable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> with a full program of entertainment and watersports. Turtles <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">nest</ENAMEX> in the sand at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> end of the island. At the other you can go sailing, diving, or deep-sea fishing or take a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> trip to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Playa Sirena</ENAMEX>, an incomparable strip of sand a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10-minute</TIMEX> boat ride away, where <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lobster lunches</ENAMEX> are available. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cayo Largo</ENAMEX>, with its captive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourist audience</ENAMEX>, is considerably more expensive than the mainland.
Some package <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> spend the whole of their holiday on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cayo Largo</ENAMEX>. Those with low boredom thresholds might consider coming for only a daytrip or for overnight trips on <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">half-hour</TIMEX> flights from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Havana</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Varadero</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Isla de la Juventud</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Isle of Youth</ENAMEX>) is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cubaâ</ENAMEX>€™s largest offshore <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX>, some <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">31 miles</NUMEX>) in diameter, but not its prettiest. It is said to have been the location for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Louis Stevensonâ</ENAMEX>€™s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Treasure Island</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pirates</ENAMEX> once buried their booty here. The island received its jaunty name in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1970s</TIMEX>, when <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as many as 22,000</NUMEX> foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> (mainly from politically sympathetic <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>) studied here in no <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fewer than 60</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>.
The island fails to live up to its colorful past. The number of foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> has dropped to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fewer than 5,000</NUMEX>, and derelict boarding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> dot the monotonous countryside. However, there are plenty of virgin beaches to be discovered, and in a slightly dingy cave at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Punta del Este</ENAMEX> you can examine enigmatic symbols painted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries ago</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Siboney Indians</ENAMEX>.
For more accessible entertainment, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nueva Gerona</ENAMEX>, the islandâ€™s little capital, is moderately attractive, with striped awnings along its smart, pillared main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>. Just east of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Presidio Modelo</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Model Prison</ENAMEX>) is fascinating. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dictator</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Machado</ENAMEX> built this copy of an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">penitentiary</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1931</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Castro</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX> of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rebels</ENAMEX> were sent here after the storming of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moncada Barracks</ENAMEX>; their ward and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Castro</ENAMEX> was kept in solitary confinement have been reconstructed.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Matanzas Province</ENAMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX> east of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HavanaÂ â€”Â largely flat sugar-cane countryÂ â€”Â was</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cubaâ</ENAMEX>€™s most important <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cane</ENAMEX>-producing <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX>. For <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">todayâ€™s visitors</ENAMEX>, however, the focus is on the big-time beach <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Varadero, Cubaâ</ENAMEX>€™s biggest draw, with opportunities for side trips to atmospheric, time-warped <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> and to the swamplands of the south coast.
Varadero
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Varadero</ENAMEX> has enthusiastic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">proponents</ENAMEX> and equally passionate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">detractors</ENAMEX> among its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>. A long peninsula with many dozens of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX>, fast-food <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cafÃ</ENAMEX>©s, and grocery <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> (and more of each on the way), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Varadero</ENAMEX> doesnâ€™t feel much like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX> at all. The easy-spending <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gringos</ENAMEX> here stick out like a sore thumb in this land of hardship, and their isolation increases <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year after year</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Varadero</ENAMEX> is a package destination, and plenty of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> fly into it and never leave. If you want to see and learn what makes <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX> a fascinating place, though, youâ€™ll need to escape for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least a couple of daytrips</TIMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> around <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX> youâ€™ll meet <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> whoÂ<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE"> â€”Â like jailbird escapeesÂ â€”Â rejoice</ENAMEX> at having gotten out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Varadero</ENAMEX>.
Still, there are plenty of delighted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX> for whom this is heaven: a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20-km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">12-mile</NUMEX>) long, virtually uninterrupted white-sand beach with shallow, clean <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX> that are described immodestly by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> as the most beautiful in the world. Varadero isnâ€™t a recent development by a government desperate for hard currency (though <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> are determined to see it become a faceless cash cow not unlike <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CancÃºn</ENAMEX>). It was in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1920s</TIMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Varadero</ENAMEX> first attracted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">millionaires</ENAMEX>, who built palatial holiday villas. Tourism proper began after <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX> with the construction of casinos and such <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">establishments</ENAMEX> as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hotel Internacional</ENAMEX>.
Even the beach, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Varaderoâ</ENAMEX>€™s best feature, can be problematic. Northern winds kick up with considerable frequency, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lifeguards</ENAMEX> put out the red flags to warn of the dangerous undertow. There is often a strong smell from the oil pumps on the resortâ€™s outskirts. Prostitution and hassling are constant and blatant, and other pests (namely, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes</ENAMEX>) are a real annoyance. Moreover, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> is spread out over <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">17 km</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">11 miles</NUMEX>), with no real <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">center</ENAMEX>, so you need transport to get around.
On the other hand, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Varadero</ENAMEX> has many very comfortable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> (most of them the results of international <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">joint ventures</ENAMEX>), open bars, and an excellent range of watersports. And, unlike other parts of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX>, topless sunbathing is allowed here. If you tire of the beach, there are organized excursions to every conceivable point of interest on the islandÂ â€”Â including <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Havana</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an hour and a half</TIMEX> away.
Varadero occupies a long, thin insular spit of sand, with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> on both sides and a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX> to the mainland. Between <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Calles</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 and 54</NUMEX> thereâ€™s something of a local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cubans</ENAMEX>, with ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cadillacs</ENAMEX> parked outside rickety wooden bungalows. The liveliest area is around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Calles 54 to 64</TIMEX>, with a shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mall</ENAMEX>, a host of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bars</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Retiro Josone</ENAMEX>, a pretty <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park set</ENAMEX> around a palm-fringed boating lake.
Spreading <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">several miles farther</NUMEX> east are the newest hotel <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> and also the restaurant <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Las AmÃ©ricas</ENAMEX>, an opulent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">beachside</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansion</ENAMEX> completed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">millionaire</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">IrenÃ</ENAMEX>©e <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Du Pont</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1930</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Matanzas</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CÃ</ENAMEX>¡rdenas
Though just spitting distance away, these quintessentially <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cuban</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> are a world apart from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Varadero</ENAMEX>. Their poorly stocked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, dusty backstreets, and primitive transport provide <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Varaderoâ€™s</ENAMEX> package <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> with a convenient insight into everyday <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cuban</ENAMEX> life before theyâ€™re whisked back to their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX>.
Matanzas, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">42 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">26 miles</NUMEX>) west of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Varadero</ENAMEX>, is busy and grimy. Lying alongside a deep bay, it came into its own during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th century</TIMEX> as the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">countryâ€™s sugar</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX>. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the leafy</TIMEX> main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Parque Libertad</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museo FarmacÃ</ENAMEX>©utico is a wonderfully preserved chemistâ€™s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop</ENAMEX>, founded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1882</TIMEX>. On a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> running east toward the bay, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Catedral de San Carlos</ENAMEX> is notable for its many murals, some restored, some badly in need of attention.
A little farther to the east, impressive <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plaza de la VigÃ­a</ENAMEX> include the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palacio de Junco</ENAMEX>, which houses a second-rate provincial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Teatro Sauto</ENAMEX>. Constructed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1863</TIMEX>, the lovely theater has tiers of wrought-iron boxes and a mural ceiling; there are performances <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">most weekends</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Las Cuevas de Bellamar</ENAMEX>, a short distance to the south, are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cubaâ</ENAMEX>€™s oldest tourist site. The caves were discovered by chance in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1861</TIMEX> by a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">slave</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">Tours</ENAMEX> (in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>) take you down into a vast <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX> for views of the many stalactites and stalagmites.
Fortunes have changedÂ â€”Â and not for the betterÂ â€”Â for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CÃ¡rdenas</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">15 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">9 miles</NUMEX>) east of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Varadero</ENAMEX>. Once the islandâ€™s most important <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sugar</ENAMEX> exportation, itâ€™s now a ramshackle place with long shopping lines and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozens</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">carts</ENAMEX> streaming up and down its main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>. With its statue of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Columbus</ENAMEX>, the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> is elegant, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Museo Oscar MarÃ­a de Rojas</ENAMEX> (at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Avenida 4 and Calle 12</NUMEX>) houses a quirky, varied collection of items, from slavesâ€™ manacles to a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19th-century</TIMEX> funeral <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coach</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fleas</ENAMEX> all dressed up to dance.
Zapata <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Peninsula</ENAMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Zapata Peninsula</ENAMEX> is the largest wetlands area in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX>, flat as a pancake and covered in mangrove swamps and grassland plains. Its protected <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">wildlife</ENAMEX> includes crocodiles, manatees, and numerous species of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX>. Frankly, though, you are unlikely to see any interesting wildlife unless you take a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">guided bird</ENAMEX>-watching trip from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Playa Larga</ENAMEX>. You can see penned reptiles at the crocodile farm at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">La Boca</ENAMEX>, a popular tourist site where you can pose with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby croc</ENAMEX> and taste crocodile steak.
A more appealing prospect is picturesque <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GuamÃ¡</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a half-hour</TIMEX> boat ride from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">La Boca</ENAMEX> along an artificial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> and then across the vast <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Laguna del Tesoro</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Treasure Lake</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Legend</ENAMEX> has it that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indians</ENAMEX> dumped their jewels into the water rather than surrender them to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conquistadores</ENAMEX>. GuamÃ¡ is a group of tiny islands connected by wooden <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridges</ENAMEX>. A few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> stay in the thatched cabaÃ±as (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">131</NUMEX>), but most just come to wander along the boardwalk, greet the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ducks</ENAMEX> and egrets, and have a meal.
The peninsula is best known, however, for its bloody role in clandestine political warfare. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South of La Boca</ENAMEX> you soon come to <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Playa GirÃ³nÂ â€”Â site</ENAMEX> of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1961</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX>-led <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bay</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Pigs invasion</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX>). At irregular intervals along the often crab-infested <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> are concrete memorials to those who died during the invasion. There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> simple, isolated bungalow hotel <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> on the bay, one at quiet <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Playa Larga</ENAMEX>, the other at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Playa GirÃ³n</ENAMEX>, where the already scruffy beach is further spoiled by a concrete breakwater. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> major attraction, however, is the excellent <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Museo Playa GirÃ³n</ENAMEX>, which serves as an emotional memorial to the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three-day</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Bay of Pigs</ENAMEX> debacle.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central Cuba</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Tourists</ENAMEX>, usually eager to get to one end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> or the other, usually <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whiz</ENAMEX> through central <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX>. The only tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">beacons</ENAMEX> are on or near the coasts: in the south around <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Cienfuegosâ€™s bay</ENAMEX> and at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trinidad</ENAMEX> (a gorgeous colonial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gem</ENAMEX>) and in the north at the small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cayo Coco</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guillermo</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Playa Santa LucÃ­a.</ENAMEX> Elsewhere, those who pause to explore can feel like goldfish in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bowlÂ â€”Â foreigners</ENAMEX> are still a novelty here.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central Cuba</ENAMEX> comprises <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">provinces</ENAMEX>: from west to east these are <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cienfuegos</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Villa Clara</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sancti Spiritus, Ciego de Avila</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CamagÃ¼ey.</ENAMEX> Each focuses on a provincial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of the same or similar name, typically of some interest yet not likely to detain you for longer than a day. The west has the best scenery, found in the lush <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sierra del Escambray</ENAMEX> mountains. To the east of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sancti Spiritus</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> are plunked down on unremittingly flat plains. Here, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sugar cane</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as high as three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> grows in abundance, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trucks</ENAMEX> trundle around with monster bundles of the stuff, and chimneys of sugar-cane <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factories</ENAMEX> poke skyward like <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cathedral towers</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">CamagÃ¼ey</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cattle</ENAMEX>-ranch <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX>, rusty watermills punctuate the skyline and vaqueros (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cowboys</ENAMEX>) slouch on <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">machetes</ENAMEX> and lassos at the ready.
Cienfuegos
The best feature of the port <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cienfuegos</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">250 km/155 miles</NUMEX> southeast of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Havana</ENAMEX>) is its position, set at the back of a large bay. Despite the industry on its periphery, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> is quite attractive, with pastel-colored neoclassical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">travelers</ENAMEX> now stop off here on their way to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trinidad</ENAMEX>.
The focal point in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parque JosÃ© MartÃ­</ENAMEX>, one of the grandest squares in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. Here you will find the monumental red-domed government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>, an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 19th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">cathedral</ENAMEX> with a startling gold-painted interior, and a music <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX> (casa <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de la</ENAMEX> trova; see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">82</NUMEX>) with whimsical flourishes. Take a guided tour of the townâ€™s finest colonial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Teatro TomÃ</ENAMEX>¡s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Terry</ENAMEX>, on the north side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>. Built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1890</TIMEX>, it was named after a rich sugar <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plantation</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owner</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venezuela</ENAMEX>. The interior, largely original, has a lovely frescoed ceiling and a semicircle of tiered boxes and wooden seats. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Enrico Caruso</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sara Bernhardt</ENAMEX> once performed here, and on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekends</TIMEX> you may be able to catch a performance by one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cubaâ</ENAMEX>€™s top <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ballet companies</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catedral de la PurÃ­sima ConcepciÃ³n</ENAMEX>, built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1870</TIMEX>, is on the east side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>. It has an attractive interior with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> stained-glass windows depicting the twelve apostles.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prado</ENAMEX> is the townâ€™s principal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">thoroughfare</ENAMEX>, a palm-lined <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">boulevard</ENAMEX> that takes you down to the spit of land protruding into the bay past smart waterside villas. At the edge of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Punta Gorda</ENAMEX>, near the end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MalecÃ³n</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Calle 37</NUMEX>), is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palacio del Valle</ENAMEX>. This ornate <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX>, now a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX>, was finished in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1917</TIMEX>; its ceilings and walls are covered in patterned stonework.
At the mouth of the bay, on the western <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">side</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Castillo de Jagua</ENAMEX> was constructed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1732</TIMEX> (long before the cityâ€™s founding in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1819</TIMEX>) to ward off <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pirates</ENAMEX>. You reach the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> on a tiny ferry from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hotel Pasacaballo</ENAMEX> on the eastern side of the bay. Close to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX> is the best beach in the area, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Playa Rancho Luna</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">JardÃ­n BotÃ¡nico Soledad</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">18 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">11 miles</NUMEX>) outside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cienfuegos</ENAMEX> on the road to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trinidad</ENAMEX>, is the oldest botanical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garden</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX> (it dates to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1899</TIMEX>) and one of the finest tropical gardens in the world. Ask at the tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cienfuegos</ENAMEX> about guided tours of the gardens.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trinidad</ENAMEX>
The scenic, undulating <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">80-km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50-mile</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> east from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cienfuegos</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trinidad</ENAMEX> skirts the foothills of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sierra del Escambray, Cubaâ€™s</ENAMEX> second-highest mountain range. The beguiling <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trinidad</ENAMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Diego VelÃ¡zquezâ</ENAMEX>€™s original <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> settlements, subsequently became rich through the smuggling, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">slave</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sugar</ENAMEX> trades. Its sizable old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> is endowed with marvelous <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> colonial architecture and has been named by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UNESCO</ENAMEX> as a â€œWorld <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heritage Site</ENAMEX>.â€ <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX> could package it as a time capsule: it is the islandâ€™s prettiest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> and one of the finest preserved colonial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> in all the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Americas</ENAMEX>.
Within easy striking distance of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trinidad</ENAMEX> are enough attractions to make a longer stay especially rewarding, including the fine beach of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Playa AncÃ³n</ENAMEX>, the lush <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valley of the Sugar Mills</ENAMEX>, and waterfalls and treks in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Escambray mountains</ENAMEX>.
Carefully restored <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansions</ENAMEX> of the well-to-do have been turned into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX>, while art <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">galleries</ENAMEX>, craft <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> occupy additional lovely old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>. No traffic, not even <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bicycles</ENAMEX>, can cope well with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trinidadâ</ENAMEX>€™s wildly uneven, cobbled street surfaces, so peace reignsÂ â€”Â especially before and after the tour<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">-bus hordes</ENAMEX> arrive. Few telltale signs of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 20th century</TIMEX> have, as yet, encroached on this wonderfully somnolent <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">outpost</ENAMEX>. At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> the old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> is coffin-quiet. For the tranquillity alone, it is worth staying <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one night</TIMEX> or more in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trinidad</ENAMEX>.
The old town clusters around the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Plaza</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mayor</ENAMEX>, an incomparably pretty square of painted railings, fanciful <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">urns</ENAMEX>, greyhound statues, and bright colonial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>. To the left of the comparatively plain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iglesia de la SantÃ­sima Trinidad</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museo RomÃ</ENAMEX>¡ntico is closed for restoration (at least through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>). The squareâ€™s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> other little <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX> both have attractive courtyards and cool interiors. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museo de ArqueologÃ</ENAMEX>­a exhibits bones of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indians</ENAMEX> and slaves along with a few <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">stuffed animals</ENAMEX>, while the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museo de Arquitectura Colonial</ENAMEX> has examples of woodwork, ironwork, stained glass, and other items culled from colonial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> in town.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">block</ENAMEX> north of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Plaza</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mayor</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museo Nacional de la Lucha Contra Bandidos</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Museum of the Struggle</ENAMEX> against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bandits</ENAMEX>), housed in a former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">convent</ENAMEX>. The bandits in question were counter-revolutionary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rebels</ENAMEX> who hid in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Escambray mountains</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s</TIMEX>. The stupendous <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">360</NUMEX>-degree view from the yellow belltower (a landmark) is the big draw.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">block</ENAMEX> south of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Plaza</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mayor</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Calle SimÃ³n Bolivar</ENAMEX> stands the grand <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palacio Cantero</ENAMEX>, built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1830</TIMEX>. Painted pillars, scrolls, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">shells</ENAMEX>, pediments, and drapes embellish the interior, eclipsing the historical artifacts and old furniture that now form the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museo Municipal de Historia</ENAMEX>. It has its own fine <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX>, though climbing its rickety narrow steps can be a trial if a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> has arrived there first.
The tiny <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Piro Guinart</ENAMEX> cigar <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factory</ENAMEX> (on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maceo</ENAMEX> at the corner of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ColÃ³n</ENAMEX>) has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only about 30</NUMEX> hand <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rollers</ENAMEX> and allows <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> to take a peek inside. A <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">block</ENAMEX> south of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Plaza</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mayor</ENAMEX> are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> completely given over to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sellers</ENAMEX> of handmade lace and other crafts.
Aimless wandering is especially fruitful in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">TrinidadÂ â€”Â and</ENAMEX>, since <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozens</NUMEX> of street names have changed and neither maps nor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> seem sure of what to call many of them, roaming without a plan is the only practical solution. Virtually every <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> is its own colonial treasure and feast for the eyes. Near the bus <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX>, you might stumble across the musical septet <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">â€œLos Pinosâ</ENAMEX>€ jamming in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>, just out of reach of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> playing stickball. Farther afield, southeast along <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Calle J. M. MÃ¡rquez</ENAMEX>, youâ€™ll find <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ermita de Santa Ana</ENAMEX>, a bricked-up <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> overlooking the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> on a hill where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> fly homemade kites.
Around <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trinidad</ENAMEX>
Trinidadâ€™s prosperity in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th century</TIMEX> came from the fruits of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> sugar mills nearby in the scenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valle de los Ingenios</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valley of the Sugar Mills</ENAMEX>), like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trinidad</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UNESCO â€œWorld Heritage Site</ENAMEX>.â€ A mirador (lookout) with spectacular views is just <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 miles</NUMEX>) out of town. Just <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6 miles</NUMEX>) farther east is the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manacas-Iznaga</ENAMEX>, where you can explore a lovely colonial hacienda <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and its startling, rocket-shaped <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Torre de Manacas-Iznaga</ENAMEX>. From the top of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Iznaga</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> would keep watch over their slaves toiling in the fields. If you donâ€™t have a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>, you can hire a private <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">taxi</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about US$12 roundtrip</NUMEX>. A special <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th-century</TIMEX> steam train used in the sugar trade traverses the whole valley for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX>; if it is functioning, it is a must. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX> leaves from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EstaciÃ³n Dragones</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5â„8 mile</NUMEX>) from the city <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>, at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10am</TIMEX> and returns at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">noon</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beach</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worshippers</ENAMEX> should head to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Playa AncÃ³n</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 16 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 miles</NUMEX>) from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trinidad</ENAMEX>, an excellent strip of white <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sand</ENAMEX> and clear waters. Here youâ€™ll find diving at an offshore coral reef, a good choice of watersports, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> popular with package <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX>. Again, you can hire a taxi or pick up a bicycle rental (give it a test ride <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, as many are so primitive that they would be scoffed at by any self-respecting commuter from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hanoi</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX>). Another good beach and fishing excursion, offered by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumbos Tours</ENAMEX>, is the daytrip to the tiny <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cayo Blanco</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Playa AncÃ³n</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sierra del Escambray</ENAMEX>
More compact than the eastern and western ranges on the island, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sierra del Escambray</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Escambray</ENAMEX> mountains), coated in luxuriant vegetation, are arguably <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cubaâ</ENAMEX>€™s most beautiful range and easily accessible. Blessed with their own microclimate, the mountains are a blessedly cool refuge from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trinidad</ENAMEX>.
To get to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Topes de Collantes</ENAMEX> national <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>, take the road west of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trinidad</ENAMEX> for the steep <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">15-km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">9-mile</NUMEX>) climb through dense forests of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">palms</ENAMEX>, eucalyptus, and pines. Youâ€™ll pass a health <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Stalinesque</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> that boasts decent <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> but lacks life. Like rewards at the end of excellent day hikes, there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> beautiful waterfalls: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salto de CaburnÃ­</ENAMEX>, at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">62 m</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">203 ft</ENAMEX>), and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Salto Vega Grande</ENAMEX>. Wear sturdy shoes, as each is a steep trek of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2.5 miles</NUMEX>) along a narrow and often muddy trail. You can swim in the chilly natural pools underneath the falls. For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CaburnÃ­</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> at the graffiti-infested <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Casa de Gallo</ENAMEX> and hit the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">trail</ENAMEX> nearby. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jeep</ENAMEX> excursions can be hired (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">US$25</NUMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>) at the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Rumbos</ENAMEX> tourism <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trinidad</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calle SimÃ³n BolÃ­var</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">430</NUMEX>). Thereâ€™s a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">US$4</NUMEX> admission fee just beyond the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Kurhotel</ENAMEX> health <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX>.
Sancti Spiritus
Few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> make it to this provincial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX>, and it isnâ€™t likely to detain you for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">more than a couple of hours</TIMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Approximately</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">80 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 miles</NUMEX>) east of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trinidad</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sancti Spiritus</ENAMEX>, one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VelÃ</ENAMEX>¡zquezâ€™s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> original <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">townships</ENAMEX>. However, itâ€™s only likely to entertain you for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an hour</TIMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>.
From the townâ€™s pleasant <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Plaza SÃ¡nchez</ENAMEX>, wander <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">blocks</ENAMEX> south to the main sight, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iglesia Parroquial</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mayor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de EspÃ­ritu Santo</ENAMEX>. This venerable, towered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> has foundations from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1522</TIMEX>, making it the countryâ€™s oldest (though the present stone <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> in fact was built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1680</TIMEX>). Nearby is the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puente Yayabo</ENAMEX>, an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 19th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX> that recalls <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Romanesque</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridges</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. From the river take the lovely, twisting street <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Calle Llano</ENAMEX>, a cobblestoned affair festooned with graceful colonial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> in soft pastels and iron <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">grilles</ENAMEX>. The nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Museo de Arte Colonial</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calle PlÃ¡cido Sur</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">74</NUMEX>) is an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> peaceful courtyards and a succession of grandly furnished <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> suffused with a gentle light entering through stained-glass windows.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cayo Coco</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cayo Guillermo</ENAMEX>
These offshore <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">caysÂ â€”Â budding starlets</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cuban</ENAMEX> joint-tourism initiatives with foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">companiesÂ â€”Â are</ENAMEX> reached by a road carving through pineapple orchards and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MorÃ³n</ENAMEX>, which is not as idiotically named as you might think. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> becomes a causeway across the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BahÃ­a de Perros</ENAMEX>; itâ€™s so long (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">28 km/17 miles</NUMEX>) that you canâ€™t see the land at the far end as you set off.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cayo Coco</ENAMEX> is named not for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coconuts</ENAMEX> but for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bird</ENAMEX>: the ibis, as revealed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hemingwayâ€™s Islands</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Stream</ENAMEX>. The author patrolled these shores in <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX> on the lookout for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nazis</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ibises</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">wading birds</ENAMEX>, often pink flamingoes, can be seen balancing in the brackish waters around the principal causeway and a smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">causeway</ENAMEX> connecting the cay to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cayo Guillermo</ENAMEX>.
Itâ€™s the superb, impossibly white sandy beaches, the intensely blue <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX>, and the excellent fishing that draw <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">travelers</ENAMEX>, and thereâ€™s not much else to distract you. Both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cays</ENAMEX> are covered in forest or thick undergrowth, and there are no settlements whatsoever (the only <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cubans</ENAMEX> who visit are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>). Plans are afoot to build <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> all along the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">22 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">14 miles</NUMEX>) of shell-shaped beaches on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cayo Coco</ENAMEX>, but accommodations are currently limited. A wide range of non-motorized <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">watersports</ENAMEX> are available to hotel <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guests</ENAMEX>; diving and safaris are popular. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cayo Guillermoâ</ENAMEX>€™s single <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX> offers a similar gamut of watersports alongside the shallowest of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX>. If you hire a moped or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jeep</ENAMEX> from either <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX>, there are virgin beaches to discover.
CamagÃ¼ey
<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">About 550 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">342 miles</NUMEX>) southeast of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Havana</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CamagÃ</ENAMEX>¼ey is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a bustling</NUMEX> but attractive and comfortable colonial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>; its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300,000</NUMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cubaâ</ENAMEX>€™s <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> largest. Restrained old faÃ§ades hide picturesque courtyards, and there are some <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half-dozen</NUMEX> squares, each boasting a crumbling and still functioning old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cattle</ENAMEX>-grazed plains of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CamagÃ</ENAMEX>¼ey hold little <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, so long ago the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> fashioned enormous earthenware pots to catch and store rainwater. Called tinajones, these still adorn many squares and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard patios</ENAMEX>.
The cityâ€™s most famous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX>, a general from the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Ten Yearsâ€™ War</ENAMEX>, was born in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1841</TIMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Casa Natal de Ignacio Agramonte</ENAMEX>, a handsome, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 19th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansion</ENAMEX> in the city <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Plaza de los Trabajadores</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patriot</ENAMEX> is remembered through personal effects; he met his death in battle in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1873</TIMEX>. Visit <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">La Merced</ENAMEX> church opposite to see peeling frescoes and the venerated objects stored in the crypt.
A dashing equine statue of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agramonte</ENAMEX> forms the centerpiece of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parque Agramonte</ENAMEX>, just to the south. The cathedral occupies <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Casa de la Trova</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">82</NUMEX>), around a floral patio, features musical performances <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</TIMEX>.
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">A ten-minute</TIMEX> walk west down <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calle Cristo</ENAMEX> brings you to a dignified <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Santo Cristo del Buen Viaje</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Christ of Good Travels</ENAMEX>), perfectly named for out-of-town <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>. Behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> is a great sea of crosses and marble <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">saints</ENAMEX> in a picturesque <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cemetery</ENAMEX>; church <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> claim it is wholly unrelated to travels that didnâ€™t go so well. A few blocks north, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Convento de Nuestra SeÃ±ora del Carmen</ENAMEX> (from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 19th century</TIMEX>) was in a disastrous <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 2000</TIMEX>, though <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> were busily rebuilding it. Just enough of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> remains to make plain that it would be stunning if carefully restored.
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">CamagÃ¼eyâ€™s finest featureÂ â€”Â and marvelously restoredÂ â€”Â is Plaza</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Juan de Dios</ENAMEX>, an angular old cobblestoned square surrounded by brightly hued, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">single</NUMEX>-story <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> dating from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 18th century</TIMEX> plus a lovely yellow church alongside a restored former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>. Itâ€™s one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cubaâ</ENAMEX>€™s most beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plazas</ENAMEX>. A few blocks south, near the river, is an impressive agricultural market open <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX> and stocked with a surprising surfeit of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meat</ENAMEX> and produce.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Playa Santa LucÃ</ENAMEX>­a
An hour-and-a-half drive (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">110 km/68 miles</NUMEX>) from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CamagÃ</ENAMEX>¼ey on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">north coast</ENAMEX>, remote <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Playa Santa LucÃ</ENAMEX>­a beckons sun worshippers with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort hotels</ENAMEX> strung along a particularly fine peninsular strip of sand. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX> backs directly onto the beach. A superb coral reef lies offshore, and diving here is excellent. Aside from a couple of roadside <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX>, however, nightlife is limited to hotel entertainment. The only other drawback is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes</ENAMEX>, as voracious as anywhere on the island.
To counter the isolation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Playa Santa LucÃ­a</ENAMEX>, the tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> offer a wide range of excursions, including a rodeo at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Rancho King</ENAMEX>, deep-sea fishing, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> and helicopter trips for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> on the beach at such unspoiled cays as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cayo Sabinal</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cayo SaetÃ­a.</ENAMEX> A bus service visits <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Playa Los Cocos</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">some 5 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 miles</NUMEX>) away; with sheltered <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aquamarine waters</ENAMEX>, itâ€™s a strong contender for the title of â€œCubaâ€™s most beautiful beach.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€ Adjacent</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">La Boca</ENAMEX>, a very small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> of waterside <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shacks</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>.
Oriente: The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">East</ENAMEX>
Prior to the revolution, the east of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX> was a single <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX> known simply as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Oriente (â€œEastâ€</ENAMEX>), and most <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cubans</ENAMEX> still refer to the region with this name. Oriente incorporates the post-revolutionary <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">provinces</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HolguÃ­n</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Granma</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santiago de Cuba</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GuantÃ¡namo</ENAMEX>, which are scenically and historically more interesting than most of central <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX>. The stunning landscapes vary from the north coastâ€™s <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">exuberant banana</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">coconut groves</ENAMEX> clustered round thatched huts, little changed from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bohÃ</ENAMEX>­os, to the towering peaks of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sierra Maestra</ENAMEX> mountains and lush rainforest on the east coast. Some of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cubaâ</ENAMEX>€™s best beaches lie on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">north</ENAMEX> coast of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oriente</ENAMEX> within sight of the mountains.
The wars of independence began in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oriente</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1860s</TIMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nearly a century</TIMEX> later <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Castro</ENAMEX> concentrated his power base in the inaccessible <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sierra Maestra</ENAMEX>. There are stirring monuments and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX> recalling these periods in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santiago de Cuba</ENAMEX>, the latter dubbed <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œHero Cityâ€</ENAMEX> for its many historic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">patriots</ENAMEX>.
The farther east you travel in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX> the more <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX> it feels. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santiago de Cuba</ENAMEX> is renowned for its contributions to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cuban</ENAMEX> musical culture; many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">greats</ENAMEX> of traditional sounds (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">TrÃ­o Matamoros</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Vieja Trova Santiaguera</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eliades Ochoa</ENAMEX>, among others) all got their starts here. It continues to be the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> place in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX> where infectious music is inescapable.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">HolguÃ­n Province</ENAMEX>
HolguÃ­n <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX> begins bleakly around the busy capital but improves considerably as you travel north, where the countryside is lusher. Guardalavaca, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">60 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">37 miles</NUMEX>) from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HolguÃ­n</ENAMEX>, is perhaps <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cubaâ</ENAMEX>€™s prettiest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX>, ringed by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">banana</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plantations</ENAMEX> and facing a gorgeous beach backed by a forest of sea-grape <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>. Watersports are excellent here and at the equally picturesqueÂ<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL"> â€”Â but isolatedÂ â€”Â beach</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Estero Ciego</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1.2 miles</NUMEX>) west. The resortâ€™s reputation is growing fast, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cuban</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> envisions it <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX> competing with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Varadero</ENAMEX>. It is still in the early stages of development and, thankfully, extremely relaxed.
There are plenty of possibilities for excursions in the vicinity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guardalavaca</ENAMEX>. To the west is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">BahÃ­a de Bariay</ENAMEX>, which has a monument claiming <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Columbusâ€™s</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">landing</ENAMEX> (a fact contested chiefly by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baracoa</ENAMEX>, farther east). Beyond the bay is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gibara</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">27 km/17 miles</NUMEX> north of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HolguÃ­n</ENAMEX>), a captivating if sleepy little port <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>. You can take a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> trip into the middle of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BahÃ­a de Naranjo</ENAMEX> to a simple <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">aquarium</ENAMEX>, where you can swim with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dolphins</ENAMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">About 6 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4 miles</NUMEX>) south of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guardalavaca</ENAMEX>, on a hill amid a forest of lofty <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">palms</ENAMEX> and thatched homesteads, is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chorro de MaÃ­ta</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caribbeanâ</ENAMEX>€™s most important excavated <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> burial ground. Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">61</NUMEX> skeletons on display, dating from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1490 to 1540</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 200</NUMEX> were disinterred), those in pre-conquest graves lie in a fetal position, while post-con-quest skeletons lie in a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> pose: outstretched with arms folded. Thick <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">banana</ENAMEX> groves coat the hillsides along the scenic <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">30-km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">19-mile</NUMEX>) route south to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Banes</ENAMEX>, a tumbledown <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of clapboard <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> with corrugated roofs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fidel Castro</ENAMEX> was married at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> here in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1948</TIMEX>, and the townâ€™s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Museo Indo-Cubano</ENAMEX> has fascinating finds from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chorro de MaÃ­ta.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santiago de Cuba</ENAMEX>
Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> prefer <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Cubaâ</ENAMEX>€™s second <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> (population <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">420,000</NUMEX>) to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santiago de Cuba</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">880 km/546 miles</NUMEX> southeast of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Havana</ENAMEX>) is unpolished, has few grand <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palaces</ENAMEX>, and cannot compare with the colonial treasures found in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Havana</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trinidad</ENAMEX>. But it is unfailingly vibrant and seductive, exuding a feel all its own. Enclosed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sierra Maestra</ENAMEX> mountains, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santiago</ENAMEX> can also be wickedly hot. Santiagueros negotiate their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hilly streets</ENAMEX> by keeping to the shady sides, and they relax with little urgency on overhanging <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">balconies</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santiago</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cubaâ</ENAMEX>€™s melting pot, with a friendly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of predominantly mulatto <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">descendants</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Haiti</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jamaicans</ENAMEX>, and huge numbers of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">slaves</ENAMEX>. Afro-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cuban</ENAMEX> traditions remain strong, reflected in music (walk down any <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> and a cacophony of sounds emanates from unseen <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>) and particularly in carnaval, now a pale shadow of its former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">selfÂ</ENAMEX> â€”Â due to lack of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">resourcesÂ â€”Â but</ENAMEX> still Cubaâ€™s best.
Founded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1514</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Santiago</ENAMEX> was the islandâ€™s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1553</TIMEX>. It is regarded as a â€œheroâ€™s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>,â€ and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locals</ENAMEX> are proud of the cityâ€™s rebellious past. Seminal events brought it center-stage again during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1950s</TIMEX>, when it assumed a major role in the revolutionary struggle. The attack on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Batistaâ€™s</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Moncada Barracks</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1953</TIMEX> thrust <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fidel Castro</ENAMEX> into the national limelight, and it was in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santiagoâ</ENAMEX>€™s main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> that he <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> declared victory, on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 January 1959</TIMEX>.
An industrial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Santiago</ENAMEX> was hit especially hard when <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX> lost its <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> support and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eastern bloc</ENAMEX> trade <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> during the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Special Period</ENAMEX>. Perhaps for this reason, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hustlers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prostitutes</ENAMEX> work <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">overtime</TIMEX> here to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> in on touristsâ€™ generosity.
Old Santiago
The most atmospheric part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Old Santiago</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Castro</ENAMEX> delivered his victory speech in the heart of the old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, from the balcony of city <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parque CÃ©spedes.</ENAMEX> More a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plaza</ENAMEX> than a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>, the attractive square is a genteel place with tall <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>, gas lanterns, and iron benches. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Old Santiagoâ</ENAMEX>€™s grid of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> unfolds here, a few blocks inland from the heavily industrialized harbor. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Parque CÃ</ENAMEX>©spedes is dominated by its twin-towered cathedral. A basilica was built on this spot in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1528</TIMEX>, but what you see was rebuilt in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 19th century</TIMEX> after a series of earthquakes and fires.
On the west side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plaza</ENAMEX> is the seriously handsome <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Casa Diego VelÃ¡zquez</ENAMEX>, built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1516</TIMEX> as the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cubaâ</ENAMEX>€™s original <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> villas. The oldest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX> and considered one of the oldest in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Americas</ENAMEX>, it is in remarkable condition. Housing the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Museo Colonial</ENAMEX>, its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> overflow with fine period furniture and carved woodwork and encircle <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two lovely courtyards.</TIMEX> Guides touch everything in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>, practically imploring you to sit on the furniture. Try to disregard the poorly realized reproductions of original wall murals around the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX>.
Across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> is the elegant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hotel Casa Granda</ENAMEX>, which opened in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1914</TIMEX>. Its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terrace</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX> on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX> floor affords excellent views of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cathedral towers</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> beyond.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calle Heredia</ENAMEX> is the epicenter of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Santiago</ENAMEX> culture and tourism. The cityâ€™s famous <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Casa de la Trova</ENAMEX> (music <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX>), which has hosted nearly all legendary <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cuban</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">musicians</ENAMEX>, is the centerpiece of both. Starting in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midmorning</TIMEX>, a succession of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">groups</ENAMEX> perform every style of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cuban</ENAMEX> music, from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> and guarachas to boleros and salsa. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Evenings</ENAMEX> in the intimate open-air <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">space</ENAMEX> inside are the place to be. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Calle Heredia</ENAMEX> is lined day and night with artisans and souvenir <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sellers</ENAMEX>.
Down the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museo del Carnaval</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> containing instruments, photos, and artifacts from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santiagoâ</ENAMEX>€™s carnival. It also usually has Afro-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cuban</ENAMEX> music on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekends</TIMEX>, as does the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Artex</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX> up the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>. Also on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calle Heredia</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Casa Natal de JosÃ© MarÃ­a Heredia</ENAMEX>, a cultural <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">birthplace</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cuban</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poet</ENAMEX> who gave his name to this much-trafficked <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>.
Nearby, on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calle PÃ­o Rosado</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Museo Emilio BacardÃ­</ENAMEX> has wide-ranging art, archaeological, and more recent historical collections (including a small, grotesque collection of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mummies</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>, in a shockingly grandiose neoclassic building on a beguiling little <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>, is named for its benefactor and the townâ€™s former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mayor</ENAMEX>, whose family founded the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BacardÃ</ENAMEX>­ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rum</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX> (which moved its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX> and production to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX> after the revolution).
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santiagoâ</ENAMEX>€™s most delightful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>-watching spots is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plaza Dolores</ENAMEX>, a shady <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plaza</ENAMEX> lined with colonial-era <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> (several of which are now curiously empty tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Avenida JosÃ© A. Saco</ENAMEX> (more commonly called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enramada</ENAMEX>) is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santiagoâ</ENAMEX>€™s main shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">thoroughfare</ENAMEX>, whose faded 1950s neon signs and ostentatious <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> recall more <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">prosperousÂ â€”Â and capitalistÂ â€”Â times</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cobbled Calle BartolomÃ© MasÃ³</ENAMEX> (also known as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Basilio</ENAMEX>), just behind <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heredia</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">cathedral</ENAMEX>, is a delightful <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> that leads to the picturesque <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">TivolÃ­</ENAMEX> neighborhood.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">TivolÃ</ENAMEX>­ youâ€™ll find the famous <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Padre Pico</ENAMEX> steps, named for a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Santiaguero</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priest</ENAMEX> who aided the cityâ€™s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poor</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Castro</ENAMEX> once roared fire and brimstone down on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Batista</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> here, but <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> youâ€™ll find more pacific chess and domino <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX> who have set up <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">all-hours</TIMEX> tables on the steps. Take the steps up to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museo de la Lucha Clandestina</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum of the Clandestine Struggle</ENAMEX>. This excellent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>, in one of the cityâ€™s finest colonial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>, focuses on the activities of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance movement</ENAMEX> under local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">martyr</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank PaÃ­s</ENAMEX>. Residents of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santiago</ENAMEX> were instrumental in supporting the revolution, as were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peasants</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sierra Maestra</ENAMEX>. From the museumâ€™s balcony, there are tremendous views of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santiago</ENAMEX> and the bay (and, unfortunately, of plumes of pollution rising up from ill-placed industrial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>).
Not far from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> is one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santiagoâ</ENAMEX>€™s best places to get sweaty in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the evening</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Casa de las Tradiciones</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œcultural centerâ€</ENAMEX> in a sweet little pink <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calle General Lacret</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">651</NUMEX>), has live music and as much dancing as its tiny <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">space</ENAMEX> will allow. Itâ€™s great fun, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locals</ENAMEX> usually outnumber the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX>.
Just west of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Padre Pico</ENAMEX> steps (south of the train <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX>) is the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-room <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">CÃ©sar Escalante cigar factory</ENAMEX>, unimpressive by comparison with other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cuban</ENAMEX> cigar <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factories</ENAMEX> but still an enjoyable place to visit, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ron</ENAMEX> Caney <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rum</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factory</ENAMEX>. The oldest <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rum</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">distillery</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, it was established in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1838</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Don Facundo BacardÃ­</ENAMEX> (whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">descendants</ENAMEX> fled the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1959</TIMEX>) and nationalized <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the following year</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rum</ENAMEX> produced here now goes under the name <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">â€œHavana Club</ENAMEX>.â€ You can visit only a small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> and bar.
Around Santiago
A good place to get your bearings on the suburbs of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> is from the rooftop <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX> of the lavish hotel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CubanacÃ¡n Santiago</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">almost 2 miles</NUMEX>) east of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cityâ€™s center</ENAMEX>. In the near distance you can make out the yellow <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moncada Barracks</ENAMEX>, which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Castro</ENAMEX> along with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 135</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rebels</ENAMEX> attacked on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26 July 1953</TIMEX>. The date is now a rallying cry and public holiday, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">barracks</ENAMEX> have been converted into a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> tells the story of the road to revolution using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozens</NUMEX> of memorable photographs. Also on display are various bloodstained rebel uniforms, some of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fidelâ</ENAMEX>€™s personal effects from his time in the mountains, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">â€œ26 Julioâ</ENAMEX>€ armbands (sporting the name of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance movement</ENAMEX> that developed after the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Moncada</ENAMEX> attack). The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bullet</ENAMEX> holes over the entrance are just for show.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North of Moncada</ENAMEX>, beyond the bus <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX>, is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plaza de la RevoluciÃ³n</ENAMEX>, a frighteningly polluted open <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> at the corner of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Av</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">las AmÃ©ricas</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Av</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">de los Libertadores</ENAMEX>. Massive spears thrust toward the sky in this monument to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Antonio Maceo</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hero</ENAMEX> of the war of independence, who is seen riding triumphantly.
The fine <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cementerio Santa Ifigenia</ENAMEX>, just north of the harbor (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Av</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crombel</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reparto Juan GÃ³mez</ENAMEX>), is the resting place of many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cuban</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heroes</ENAMEX>. Pride of place goes to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cuban</ENAMEX> founding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">JosÃ© MartÃ­</ENAMEX>, in a vast octagonal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mausoleum</ENAMEX> designed so that the tomb catches the sun throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX>. Look also for the tombs of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CÃ©spedes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank PaÃ</ENAMEX>­s; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frankâ€™s</ENAMEX> (as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">santiagueros</ENAMEX> refer to him) is marked like many others with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cuban</ENAMEX> flag and the flag of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26 July</TIMEX> movement.
In an impressive setting <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">7 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4 miles</NUMEX>) from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">El Morro Castle</ENAMEX>, surveying the harbor mouth from a commanding clifftop position. Moated, thickly walled, and full of cannons, drawbridges, and passageways, it is in excellent condition. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> houses displays on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pirates</ENAMEX> through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the ages</TIMEX>. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guide</ENAMEX> will point out a torture <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> with a trap door in the floor, through which uncooperative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prisoners</ENAMEX> and slaves were reportedly dropped to the sea below. Thatâ€™s not a terribly appetizing thought, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX> just beyond the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX>, also called <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">â€œEl Morro,â€</ENAMEX> has gorgeous views of the sea and some of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Santiagoâ€™s finest food</ENAMEX>; itâ€™s a great place to get out of the intense sun. The easiest way to get to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Morro</ENAMEX> is to hire a taxi, which costs <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about US$15 roundtrip</NUMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">driver</ENAMEX> will wait for up to <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a couple hours</TIMEX> while you explore the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> and even eat lunch).
A place of great import (and considerable beauty) to all <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cubans</ENAMEX> is the triple-domed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BasÃ­lica del Cobre</ENAMEX>, named after the nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">copper mines</ENAMEX> that rise out of the forested foothills <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">18 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">11 miles</NUMEX>) west of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santiago</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cuban</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">faithful</ENAMEX> make <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> pilgrimages to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> to pay tribute to its statue of a black virgin, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Virgen de la Caridad</ENAMEX> (Virgin of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Charity</ENAMEX>). According to legend, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cubaâ</ENAMEX>€™s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patron saint</ENAMEX> was rescued bobbing in the sea in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th century</TIMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fishermen</ENAMEX> about to capsize in a storm. With the wooden statue in their grasp, they miraculously made it to shore. Pilgrims, often making the last of the trek on their knees, pray to her image and place mementos and offerings of thanks for her miracles; among them are small <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> and prayers for those who have tried to escape <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX> on rafts. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Virgen</ENAMEX> is on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX>, encased in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glass</ENAMEX> and cloaked in a glittering gold robe.
You can take a taxi to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Cobre</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">around US$15 roundtrip</NUMEX>, although more adventurous sorts can hop a mÃ¡quina (vintage <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">automobile taxi</ENAMEX>) or colectivo (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bus</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">truck</ENAMEX>) out to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> and walk the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">mile</NUMEX> or so to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>. If youâ€™d like to stay overnight in this spectacular (and deathly peaceful) area, there is a hostal, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">HospederÃ­a de la Caridad</ENAMEX>, behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreigners</ENAMEX> who abide by the strict rules can stay for a mere <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">five pesos</NUMEX> a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">133</NUMEX>).
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">East of Santiago</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Parque Baconao</ENAMEX>, a biosphere reserve spread over <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">40 km</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">25 miles</NUMEX>). The local dark-sand beaches can be scrubby and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> themselves are isolated, but thereâ€™s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lots</ENAMEX> to explore in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sierra de La Gran Piedra</ENAMEX> rise majestically above the coast.
A tortuous side road <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12 km</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">7 miles</NUMEX>) east along the coast ascends the mountains to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">La Gran Piedra</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Stone</ENAMEX>), where you can climb on foot for a birdâ€™s-eye view of eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">About 2 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about a mile</NUMEX>) beyond, a passable dirt <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">track</ENAMEX> leads to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Museo La Isabelica</ENAMEX>, a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19th-century</TIMEX> coffee-plantation finca (country <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>) with a workshop, original furniture, and a concrete garden where <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee beans</ENAMEX> were once laid out to dry.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">GuantÃ¡namo Province</ENAMEX>
You can reach <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cubaâ</ENAMEX>€™s remote, mountainous, far-eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> by continuing along the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">coast</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parque Baconao</ENAMEX> on a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">memorableÂ â€”Â but goodÂ â€”Â</ENAMEX> dirt <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">track</ENAMEX> and paved <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>; alternatively, you can backtrack to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santiago</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX> has only one true tourist draw, but itâ€™s a super <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>: the magical little <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baracoa</ENAMEX>. The only reason to stop over in the unappealing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GuantÃ¡namo</ENAMEX> would be to visit the lookout point that is trained on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> naval <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base</ENAMEX>.
The dry, cactus-strewn landscape of the south coast begins to change as you follow the winding, spectacular <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">30-km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">18.8-mile</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road â€œLa Farolaâ€</ENAMEX> across the mountains to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baracoa</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">150 km/93 miles</NUMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santiago</ENAMEX>), a picturesque little village known for its local chocolate and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">coconut factories</ENAMEX>. The tropical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seaside</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> is surrounded by green hillsides covered with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocoa</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coconut groves</ENAMEX>, and all around are palm-backed beaches and delightful, sinewy rivers. Named a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UNESCO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biosphere</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baracoa</ENAMEX> has no <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fewer than ten</NUMEX> rivers. Itâ€™s smack in the middle of the wettest region in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX>, the reason <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adventure travelers</ENAMEX> have their scopes trained on the townâ€™s rivers, ripe for whitewater rafting.
That <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baracoa</ENAMEX> was the first settlement to be established by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diego VelÃ</ENAMEX>¡zquez in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1511Â â</NUMEX>€”Â making it the oldest colonial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AmericasÂ â€”Â</ENAMEX> is not in doubt. However, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locals</ENAMEX> also claim that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Columbus</ENAMEX> first landed at this spot (rather than near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gibara</ENAMEX>, north and west of here, as most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">historians</ENAMEX> believe). They insist that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Columbus</ENAMEX> planted the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cruz de la Parra</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cross of the Vine</ENAMEX>) in the soil on his arrival. The cross is on display in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nuestra SeÃ±ora de la AsunciÃ³n</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Plaza Independencia</ENAMEX>. (Whatever the truth of the matter, carbon dating has established that the cross is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than 500 years old</TIMEX>.)
Baracoa, though, has so much going for it that any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Columbus</ENAMEX> are a bonus. A good place to get your bearings is the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">hilltop</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hotel El Castillo</ENAMEX>, a former <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> looking out over old red-tiled roofs, the townâ€™s oyster-shaped bay, and the landmark mountain known as <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">â€œEl Yunqueâ€ (â€œThe Anvilâ€</ENAMEX>), so named on account of its singular shape.
On <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Calle Antonio Maceo</ENAMEX>, youâ€™ll find <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> queuing for hot <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chocolate drinks</ENAMEX> in the baking tropical sun at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Casa del Chocolate</ENAMEX>. Opposite is a charming <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Casa de la Trova</ENAMEX>, with rooftop performances. In the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> is a striking bust of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hatuey</ENAMEX>, the brave <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> who resisted early conquistadores until he was caught by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> and burned at the stake. Also wander along the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MalecÃ³n</ENAMEX>, the seaside <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">avenue</ENAMEX>, from the snug <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fuerte MatachÃ­n</ENAMEX> (an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 19th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">fort</ENAMEX> that has a small municipal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> attached) to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hotel La Rusa</ENAMEX>, named after a legendary and glamorous <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Russian Ã©migrÃ©e</ENAMEX> who over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</TIMEX> hosted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">celebrities</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Che</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fidel</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Errol Flynn</ENAMEX>.
In and around <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baracoa</ENAMEX> are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several dozen</NUMEX> pre-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Colombian</ENAMEX> archaeological sites related to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> major <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> that inhabited the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time or another. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">native group</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yateras</ENAMEX>, still exists.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baracoa</ENAMEX> really shines <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the week of 1 April</TIMEX>, when heady street <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">every night</TIMEX> commemorate the date <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">General</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Antonio Maceo</ENAMEX> disembarked at nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Playa Duaba</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1895</TIMEX>, marking the beginning of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Cubaâ€™s War</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Independence</ENAMEX>.
