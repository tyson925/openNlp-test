Where to Go
Canc√∫n
When the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> decided to improve its economy by developing its tourist industry, a totally new, tailor-made, high-class <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> was the aim; the major decision was where its site should be. Many factors were taken into account before a short list of locations was entered into a computer. When the final results were correlated, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canc√∫n</ENAMEX> was top of the list.
This location had many natural attributes in its favor. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twenty-</NUMEX><NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">seven kilometers</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">17 miles</NUMEX>) long and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">less than a kilometer</NUMEX> wide, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> is shaped like the number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX>, and separated from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yucat√°n</ENAMEX> peninsula by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">only 10 m</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX> ft) of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>. Its eastern shoreline is one long beach of fine white <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sand</ENAMEX> (there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> named beaches along the strip), which is washed by the translucent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">azure waters</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX>. Between the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> and the mainland is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Laguna Nichupt√©</ENAMEX>, a huge seawater lagoon bounded by mangrove swamps that are <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">havens</ENAMEX> to numerous species of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">wildlife</ENAMEX>.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> a string of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> have taken much of the beachfront real estate; the balance given over to bars, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">nightclubs</ENAMEX>, and shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">malls</ENAMEX>. On the lagoon side, watersports and eco-tours abound in the calmer shallow waters. Blue signs denote public beach access and there are no restrictions, so you can walk the island‚Äôs full length without concerns about trespass. All in all, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canc√∫n</ENAMEX> has everything needed for the perfect relaxing vacation.
Finding your way around the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> couldn‚Äôt be simpler. There is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">thoroughfare</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Kukulk√°n Boulevard</ENAMEX>, running the full length of the island, and every hotel and attraction is only a few strides from it. The addresses of most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> will include their position on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Kukulk√°n Boulevard</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kilometers</NUMEX>; the farther south, the bigger the number. This guide explores the island from north to south, giving the exact location of attractions in <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kilometers</NUMEX> to make it easy for you to find what you need. You could rent a vehicle of some sort to travel back and forth to your <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX>, but there is a very reliable and inexpensive bus service stopping regularly, and usually directly outside the major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX>, at intervals along the route. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">buses</ENAMEX> run from <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early morning</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midnight</TIMEX>.
Crossing from the mainland onto the island¬†‚Äî¬†into the area called the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hotel Zone¬</ENAMEX>†‚Äî¬†the lagoon with its rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mangrove</ENAMEX> forest is on the right. You may see a passing pleasure-boat on the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, or a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">jet</ENAMEX>-ski <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">convoy</ENAMEX> on the lookout for wildlife such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">herons</ENAMEX>, pelicans, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">deer</ENAMEX>, wild boar, even the occasional crocodile¬†‚Äî¬†though the local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">creatures</ENAMEX> tend to only be found in the most remote parts of the mangrove, well away from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>. Between the lagoon and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> is a narrow grassy area called the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Parque de las Artes</ENAMEX>, with topiary and large <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boulders</ENAMEX> sitting on the pristine <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">lawns</ENAMEX>, and shaded seats where you can relax and watch the world go by. If you‚Äôre feeling a bit more energetic, on the left of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> there is a wide cycling, in-line skating, and jogging <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">track</ENAMEX> for much of the length of the island.
This part of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canc√∫n</ENAMEX> has the calmest sea for swimming and snorkeling, lying as it does in the shelter of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Isla Mujeres</ENAMEX> just offshore. At <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">km 3.5 you‚Äôll</NUMEX> find <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Playa Linda Marine Terminal</ENAMEX>, where a number of pleasure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">craft</ENAMEX> leave for trips to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Isla Mujeres</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sunset cruises</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Captain Hook</ENAMEX>, resembles a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pirate ship</ENAMEX>; shipmates play games while sailing the high seas. At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">km 5</TIMEX> you will pass a huge <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> flag, one of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only seven</NUMEX> this size in the whole <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. You can see it from most points on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX>; it is only taken down in high winds. Just beyond the flag on the left is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tortuga Pier</ENAMEX>, hosting boating trips and the ferry <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terminal</ENAMEX>, plus access to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Playa Tortuga</ENAMEX> beach. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Kilometer 7</ENAMEX> sees a right turn to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">18-hole Pok-Ta-Pok</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">golf course</ENAMEX>, which is located on a large land-mass that juts out into the lagoon.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">area</ENAMEX> around <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">km 8.5</TIMEX>, where the island bends south, is the heart of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hotel Zone</ENAMEX>, the focus for activity of all kinds. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">malls</ENAMEX> can be found here: the ultra-modern <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Plaza Caracol</ENAMEX>, a mix of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">craft</ENAMEX> and tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mayafair</ENAMEX>, with its unmistakable fa√ßade fashioned of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chaac</ENAMEX> masks, is still in development but will eventually be a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> craft showcase; and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Forum</ENAMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sea</ENAMEX>, with several fast food eateries and a cine-complex showing the latest <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> movies. Dominating the scene here is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Centro de Convenciones</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Convention Center</ENAMEX>), which, among other things, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hosts</ENAMEX> musical and artistic exhibitions: check the program during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">your</TIMEX> visit. Near the main entrance is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museo Arqueol√≥gico de Canc√∫n</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canc√∫n Archaeological Museum</ENAMEX>), displaying pottery, masks, and jewelry from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">El Rey</ENAMEX> site and others in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Quintana Roo</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Convention Center</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hotel</ENAMEX> Zone craft market¬†‚Äî¬†designated the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Flea Market</ENAMEX> on the sign outside. You‚Äôll hear a lot of requests to just take a look at the merchandise displayed in this warren of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stalls</ENAMEX>. Prices for crafts and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">knick-knacks</ENAMEX> are negotiable, and generally cheaper than in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">malls</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kilometers</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 to 13</NUMEX> have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> more shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">malls</ENAMEX>. On the lagoon side, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Flamingo Plaza</ENAMEX>; a bit farther south is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plaza la Isla</ENAMEX>, fashioned after a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Venetian</ENAMEX> lagoon. This is one of the most recent developments in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canc√∫n</ENAMEX>, boasting a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">nightclub</ENAMEX>, cinema complex, and plans for an interactive <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">aquarium</ENAMEX> featuring <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dolphins</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurse</ENAMEX> sharks. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Plaza Kukulk√</ENAMEX>°n, at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">km 13</TIMEX> on the ocean side, is the largest and most up-market <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mall</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canc√∫n</ENAMEX>, with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">designer outlets</ENAMEX> for clothing, jewelry, and accessories, plus fine dining, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cinema</ENAMEX>, and a bowling <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>. The large interior spaces are used for regular art exhibitions.
At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">km 15.2</TIMEX> on the lagoon side is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">AquaWorld</ENAMEX>, which sells and rents just about every piece of equipment you need to travel on, under, or above the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>; it is also one of the largest accredited diving instruction <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Head</ENAMEX> out into the lagoon on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the fleets of jet-skis or small power <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX>, sign up for a snorkeling tour, or if you‚Äôd like to see marine life but stay dry, ride the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sub See Explorer</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mini-submarine</ENAMEX> with viewing windows so you get just as good a view as those in wet suits. If you still have the energy, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AquaWorld</ENAMEX> offers <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skyrider</ENAMEX>, a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-seat para-chair that floats in the sky across the lagoon.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Kilometer 18</ENAMEX> is the location of the only public <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mayan</ENAMEX> site in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canc√∫n region</ENAMEX> (there are small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pyramids</ENAMEX> located in the ground of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pyramides Hotel</ENAMEX>, but these are not accessible to non-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guests</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ruinas del Rey</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">King‚Äôs Ruins</ENAMEX>) are set in low jungle, and bounded on the lagoon side by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">greens</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hilton Canc√∫n & Golf Resort</ENAMEX>. An occasional stray ball is found within the archaeological site; the guides will joke that it was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maya</ENAMEX>, not the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scots</ENAMEX>, who invented the game. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Rey</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> are not large by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mayan</ENAMEX> standards. The temples were built in line rather than in a cluster, with the largest in the middle. Lizards <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about half</NUMEX> a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">meter</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 ft</ENAMEX>) long call the walls home, basking in the sunshine but disappearing in a flash if you venture too close. Opposite the entrance to the ruins is access to the most southerly beach on the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">strip</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Playa Delphines</ENAMEX>.
Toward the very bottom of the island, at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">km 21</TIMEX>, is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Punta Nizuc</ENAMEX>. The land in this area is mostly mangrove swamp and a haven for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">wildlife</ENAMEX>, being remote from the tourist activity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hotel Zone</ENAMEX>. But when you reach <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">km 25</NUMEX>, you‚Äôll find <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parque Nizuc</ENAMEX>, a commercial water <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> featuring <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">‚ÄúWet‚ÄônWild‚Äù water</ENAMEX> slides, wave pool, and river rides, with a sandy beach and lagoon area to enjoy.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Canc√∫n Hotel Zone</ENAMEX> needs a vast number of support <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> both for hotel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">service</ENAMEX> and continued development. Most of them live in downtown <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canc√</ENAMEX>∫n on the mainland just <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a few kilometers</NUMEX> away, an area that was developed concurrently with the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hotel Zone</ENAMEX>. With little heavy industry or crime, it is considered a good place to live by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who travel from all over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> to work in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX>. A series of service industries thrive, along with a lower-key tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sector</ENAMEX>.
Downtown <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canc√∫n</ENAMEX>, built on a grid plan, is dominated by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Avenida Tulum</ENAMEX>, which runs north‚Äìsouth through the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>. Here you will find <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, currency exchange <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>, and travel <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Avenida Cob√</ENAMEX>° <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">leads</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hotel</ENAMEX> Zone into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>; most of the important <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avenida Tulum</ENAMEX> can be found to the north of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cob√°.</ENAMEX> Firstly, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canc√∫n Convention and Visitors Bureau</ENAMEX> are on the corner of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cob√°</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tulum</ENAMEX>. Heading north, at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hi-Kuic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">craft</ENAMEX> market you‚Äôll find the same goods as in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hotel Zone</ENAMEX>, but a little cheaper. Following are the police <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">station</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ayuntamiento Benito Ju√°rez</ENAMEX>, the city <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX>. The traffic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">circle</ENAMEX> at the top of this block (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tulum</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Uxmal</ENAMEX>) has a distinctive sculpture as its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centerpiece</ENAMEX>, featuring carvings depicting the eras of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mexico‚</ENAMEX>Äôs history. Just beyond this is the bus <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX>, where regular service departs west to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M√©rida</ENAMEX> and south along the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Maya Riviera</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tulum</ENAMEX>.
A block west of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avenida Tulum</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avenida Yaxchil√°n</ENAMEX>, where you‚Äôll find the main <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">post office</ENAMEX>. Between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parque de las Palapas</ENAMEX>, a small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> and open-air concert <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pavilion</ENAMEX>, where local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> meet to talk, listen to live music, and while the evenings away. On the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> around the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">park¬†‚Äî¬†each</ENAMEX> named after a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">flower¬†‚Äî¬†there</ENAMEX> are small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, plus portable <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stalls</ENAMEX> selling fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit juices</ENAMEX> or hot <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">snacks</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Avenida Tulum</ENAMEX> leads north, and then veers east to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Ju√°rez</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passenger</ENAMEX> and vehicle ferries to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Isla Mujeres</ENAMEX>. These depart several times <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each day</TIMEX> with both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locals</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> aboard.
Isla Mujeres
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isla Mujeres¬†</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Island of the Women</ENAMEX>) lies <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only 8 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 miles</NUMEX>) offshore from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canc√∫n</ENAMEX>; the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">40-minute</TIMEX> ferry ride transports you from an ultra-modern atmosphere to an environment in which time moves more slowly. Several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> offer <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one-day</TIMEX> sailing trips to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isla Mujeres</ENAMEX>, often including lunch and snorkeling; they depart from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Playa Linda</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pier Tortugas</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hotel Zone</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isla Mujeres</ENAMEX> now has a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">around 15,000</NUMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">past centuries</TIMEX>, however, it was the haunt of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pirates</ENAMEX>, being far from the clutches of colonial overlords in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Havana</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Juan</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Panama City</ENAMEX>, the nearest colonial outposts. The earliest recorded <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> arrived in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1517</TIMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Spanish explorer Francisco Hern√</ENAMEX>°ndez <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">de C√≥rdoba</ENAMEX> landed to discover a number of small temples built for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">goddess</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fertility Ix chel</ENAMEX>. It was he who named the island. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mujeres</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only 8 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 miles</NUMEX>) in length, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">less than a kilometer</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1‚ÅÑ2 mile</NUMEX>) at its widest point, and split by inland lakes and bays. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> forms an ellipse, following the shape of the coastline.
Most ferries deposit you at the very northern tip of the island, on the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pier</ENAMEX> of the only <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mujeres</ENAMEX>. Craft <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> and bars <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX> onto the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sidewalks</ENAMEX> and sandy <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>. The place bustles, especially when the ferries arrive. As <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> turns to <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX>-trippers <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> back to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canc√∫n</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isla Mujeres</ENAMEX> takes on a much quieter character. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> has many loyal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fans</ENAMEX> that return <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year after year</TIMEX> for its particular atmosphere. Many who choose to stay come for the diving, which usually means low-key entertainment and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early nights</TIMEX>.
A few minutes‚Äô walk north of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> is the main beach, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Playa Norte</ENAMEX>, also known as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Coco Beach</ENAMEX>. It has sheltered waters and fine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sand</ENAMEX>, particularly suitable for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">Coconut palms</ENAMEX> provide shade and a few pelicans fly overhead in search of a meal.
Heading south out of town <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">you‚Äôll</ENAMEX> pass the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> naval <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base</ENAMEX> and a small commercial airstrip before traveling alongside <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laguna Makax</ENAMEX> on the right. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> here, guarded from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean Sea</ENAMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> itself, has been used for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX> as a safe harbor during storms and hurricanes. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pirate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">fleets</ENAMEX> stopped here, because passing naval <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX> would not see their <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX>.
On the far side of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Laguna Mekax</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tortugranja Turtle Farm</ENAMEX>, which has played a major role in protecting <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> of the endangered <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">marine creatures</ENAMEX> and trying to build their numbers. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Every year</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">nest sites</ENAMEX> are protected and a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX> removed. The hatchlings are cared for until they are <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year old</TIMEX>, and then returned to the ocean. You can see the young <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">turtles</ENAMEX> throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX>, but the best time to visit the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">farm</ENAMEX> is during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">egg</TIMEX>-laying <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX>; from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May through September</TIMEX>, it is possible to visit the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">nest sites</ENAMEX> and watch the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">turtles</ENAMEX> laying eggs.
Heading south on the coast, there are numerous small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">guest-houses</ENAMEX> catering to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">divers</ENAMEX>. Just offshore, a coral reef in shallow <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> has become one of the major diving and snorkeling venues in the world. Although the inner reefs were damaged in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early years</TIMEX> of their popularity, they are now protected under the auspices of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">National Park</ENAMEX> service as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Garraf√≥n</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Punta Sur Park</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacques Cousteau</ENAMEX> made <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Garraf√≥n</ENAMEX> famous in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s</TIMEX>, when he filmed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">nurse sharks</ENAMEX> in their caves in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>. You can still find them at the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Cave of the Sleeping Sharks</ENAMEX>, and experienced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">divers</ENAMEX> can swim with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">them¬†‚Äî¬†not</ENAMEX> as frightening as you would think, as <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">nurse sharks</ENAMEX> are not dangerous to humans¬†‚Äî¬†in their dark, watery hideouts. Non-certified <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">divers</ENAMEX> who want the chance can swim with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sharks</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">El Garraf√≥n</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pier</ENAMEX>, where several <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sharks</ENAMEX> are kept in pens for this purpose. The marine life is truly spectacular at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>, both in the shallow and the outer reef areas. The land around the southern tip of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> is also protected; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Punta Sur</ENAMEX> is a wind-swept, salty spot where the waves of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX> crash onto the rocks. The remains of a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mayan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> can be seen here, along with a lighthouse that guides <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sailors</ENAMEX> safely to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX> to this day.
Cozumel
Cozumel was also brought to the world‚Äôs attention by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacques Cousteau‚</ENAMEX>Äôs diving films of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s</TIMEX>. With the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>-longest coral reef in the world just off its western coastline, it soon became a haunt for all those who enjoyed the underwater world. Today, along with enjoying status as one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">premier</ENAMEX> dive islands in the world, it is also a duty-free cruise <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX>, with shopping to match the best in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX>.
However, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cozumel</ENAMEX> has a much longer history of human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">habitation</ENAMEX>. It was a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mayan</ENAMEX> site of some importance, being the center of worship for the fertility <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">goddess Ix-chel</ENAMEX>. Cozumel became a destination for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mayan</ENAMEX> pilgrims from all over <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Yucat√°n</ENAMEX> in the late and post-classical periods (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">a.d. 900‚Äì1650</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Maya</ENAMEX> who lived here traded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">honey</ENAMEX> all along the coast; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Xcaret</ENAMEX> was their major port on the mainland.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> conducted the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catholic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mass</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> here after their arrival in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1518</TIMEX>, but they had little interest in the island. It remained almost uninhabited through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 18th century</TIMEX>. But following the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">War of the Castes</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1847‚Äì1848</NUMEX>, several rebel <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> settled here to escape retribution by colonial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">landowners</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yucatecan</ENAMEX> mainland. They eked out a simple living for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX> until the invention of the scuba <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tank</ENAMEX>. And the rest, as they say, is history!
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cozumel</ENAMEX> has multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personalities</ENAMEX>; it caters to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">divers</ENAMEX> who go to bed early and rise with the sun, yet it also has occasionally raucous nightlife for those who want to stay out and party. Those who know the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> well refer to this phenomenon as the ‚Äúwet‚Äù side and the ‚Äúdry‚Äù side. Day-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trippers</ENAMEX> who arrive on their huge floating cruise <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships¬†‚Äî¬†or</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> ferries from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Playa del Carmen¬</ENAMEX>†‚Äî¬†add <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an extra</NUMEX> dimension; they want to see everything in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a few hours</TIMEX>, so the slow routine of island life speeds up when they arrive.
There is only one settlement, the capital, on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cozumel</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Miguel de Cozumel</ENAMEX>; it‚Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a bustling</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> chock-full of souvenir <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, duty-free <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">emporiums</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX>, and assorted caf√©s and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>. If you arrive on the island by ferry from the mainland, you‚Äôll be dropped off directly opposite the heart of the downtown area, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plaza del</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sol</ENAMEX>, also called the z√≥calo. This large, tree-lined <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> is where everyone meets for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX>, or lunch at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">caf√©s</ENAMEX> nearby. Several <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> surrounding the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> are traffic-free, and you can stroll at your leisure among the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> selling T-shirts, pottery, onyx, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">silver</ENAMEX>. The storeowners have a practiced line and can be pretty persuasive, so it pays to have a sense of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">humor¬†‚Äî¬†or</ENAMEX> a few words of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> so you can join in the banter.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> running along the seafront is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Avenida Rafael Melgar</ENAMEX>, also known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Malec√≥n</ENAMEX>, almost constantly busy with traffic. It is lined with numerous duty-free <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> selling fragrances, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designer</ENAMEX> clothing, and jewelry and gemstones. Above these are bars and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> that keep the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> buzzing until <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the early hours of the morning</TIMEX>. Stop in at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museo de la Isla de Cozumel</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum of the Island of Cozumel</ENAMEX>) on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avenida Melgar</ENAMEX>, which displays some interesting artifacts found on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> and salvaged from wrecks around its shores. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> floor offer simple explanations about the geology of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yucat√°n</ENAMEX> peninsula and the development of coral reefs offshore. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>-floor <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> tell the story of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cozumel‚</ENAMEX>Äôs history, from ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mayan</ENAMEX> carvings to conquistador helmets and swords. There is also a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">room</ENAMEX> dedicated to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> who settled in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cozumel</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th</TIMEX> century¬†‚Äî¬†after the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">War of the Castes¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†and who have developed the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that time</TIMEX>.
Traveling around the island couldn‚Äôt be simpler. There is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> main highway which follows the western coastline, travels around the southern tip, and returns up the east coast. It then cuts across the island at its widest point back to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">northwest</ENAMEX> section of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> is inaccessible by most rental <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicles</ENAMEX> (you may find a clause in your contract forbidding you to try the unmade <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>). This part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> is a haven for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">wildlife</ENAMEX>, because few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> venture here. There are also a few <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mayan</ENAMEX> ruins to explore.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North</ENAMEX> of town you will find the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX>, with several flights <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> to other parts of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> and a few <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX>. Several of the older <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> are located along the road here, though the rocky shoreline has fewer beaches than in the south.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South of San Miguel</ENAMEX>, you will find the major cruise <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Ceiba</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">around 3 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 miles</NUMEX>) from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>. Several large cruise <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX> dock <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each week</TIMEX>, bringing a flurry of activity; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">taxi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drivers</ENAMEX> increase their speed to make the most of the business. There is a good beach at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Ceiba</ENAMEX> and a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX>, plus several dive outfits have bases here¬†‚Äî¬†you can book a class or rent equipment. Farther south, in the ocean offshore, the reef holds the attention of even the most experienced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">divers</ENAMEX> because of its variety of animal and coral life. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Turtles</ENAMEX>, rays, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sharks</ENAMEX>, and many species of colorful tropical <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> can be found here, many at a reasonable depth for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">novice divers¬</ENAMEX>†‚Äî¬†though the reef walls are better left to those with experience. The booking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Atlantis Submarine</ENAMEX> is also here; this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mini-submersible</ENAMEX> is ideal for non-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">divers</ENAMEX>, allowing a glimpse of the thriving underwater world without your having to get wet.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South</ENAMEX> of the cruise <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> (currently in the process of being upgraded) leads away from the urban development and out into the countryside. This part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> has some of the best and most sheltered beaches. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX>, a number of excellent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort hotels</ENAMEX> have been built on large plots of land; you will see their gated entrances as you drive by. Next to these are the more modest accommodations that for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> have catered to dedicated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">divers</ENAMEX>.
Around <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 km</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 miles</NUMEX>) from town you will find the entrance to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Chankanaab State Park</ENAMEX>. This was one of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> on the island to offer organized reef snorkeling in an offshore lagoon, though as it became more popular it developed other attractions. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Snorkeling</ENAMEX> is still extremely good offshore, though the lagoon site is now devoid of marine life and is used simply as a safe swimming area. Chankanaab offers a botanical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garden</ENAMEX> and a sculpture <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> displaying native art from all areas of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>. It has a dive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop</ENAMEX>, beach umbrellas, sun beds, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>. Perhaps the prize of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> goes to the ‚ÄúSwim with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dolphins‚</ENAMEX>Äù program. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dolphins</ENAMEX> are kept in open water just offshore and reached by a wooden <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">walkway</ENAMEX>. Small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> can enter the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dolphins</ENAMEX>; an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">instructor</ENAMEX> controls the activities and exercises.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South</ENAMEX> from Chankanaab you can stop at a number of fine sandy beaches on the west coast. The major <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Playa San Francisco</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Playa del Sol</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Playa Palancar</ENAMEX>. All the main beaches have public access and each has its own <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">caf√©-bar</ENAMEX>, watersports <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX>, and lockers for beachgoers. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> is a beautiful clear turquoise color; you will see small dive or snorkel <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> bobbing offshore as you soak up the sun. These waters offer some of the best diving and snorkeling in the world. The variety of sea-life living on and around the coral reef here is amazing, with many of the largest migratory <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish species</ENAMEX> paying a visit at different times of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX>. In order to protect the delicate environment around the reef, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Cozumel Reefs National Park</ENAMEX> was created in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 1996</TIMEX>, covering <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">over 80%</NUMEX> of the dive sites off the island in its <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">11,987 hectares</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">29,620 acres</NUMEX>). There is a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">US$2</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> charge to dive in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>.
Between <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Playa del Sol</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Playa Palancar</ENAMEX> you will see a dirt <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> marked by an arch printed with the words <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Cedral</ENAMEX> that veers left from the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">highway</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> is poor and it requires some patience to avoid the potholes, but it leads to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Cedral</ENAMEX>, from where it is possible to ride a horse to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mayan</ENAMEX> ruins deep in the forest (take insect repellent if you intend to make the journey). It was at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">El Cedral</ENAMEX> that the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catholic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mass</ENAMEX> was said in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>, on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6 May 1518</TIMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May each year</TIMEX> the settlement re-enacts the event and also holds a fiesta with horseback riding, music, and dancing.
The very southern tip of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> is a national <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>, protected from the development, which threatened its wild but fragile environment. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parque Punta Sur</ENAMEX> (South <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Point Park</ENAMEX>) was opened in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 1999</TIMEX>. Access is not permitted by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> provides electric <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bicycles</ENAMEX>, buggies, and a colorful open-sided tour bus to give access to the interior; <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two hours</TIMEX> of free cycle use is included with the entry ticket. Next to the car <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> where you leave your <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicle</ENAMEX>, and information <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">center</ENAMEX> provides details about the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> and its <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flora</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">fauna</ENAMEX>. Within <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Punta Sur‚Äôs</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,100 hectares</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2,718 acres</NUMEX>) are the coast, with its wild beaches and sand dunes, and the interior, lagoons and mangrove swamps with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of crocodiles and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bird species</ENAMEX>. You can explore <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Punta Celerain</ENAMEX>, the most southerly point of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cozumel</ENAMEX> and now part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Punta Celerain Lighthouse</ENAMEX>, once <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">protector</ENAMEX> of shipping in the area, and now refurbished to house the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museo de la Navegaci√≥n</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navigation Museum</ENAMEX>). A series of dioramas in both <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> explain navigation methods through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the ages</TIMEX>, including those of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Maya</ENAMEX> who lived in the region. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> is dedicated to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lighthouse-keepers</ENAMEX> and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>, who lived here full time, often cut off from the rest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Miguel</ENAMEX>.
From <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Punta Sur</ENAMEX> the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">highway</ENAMEX> heads north up the eastern coastline. The conditions here offer quite a contrast to the west, with the waves of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX> lashing against limestone rocks, and the low vegetation leaning inward, blown by the sea breezes. The whole area has a stark and wild beauty, reminiscent perhaps of the time when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cozumel</ENAMEX> was the haunt of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pirates</ENAMEX> and renegades. The tidal surge is very strong here, so swimming and snorkeling are not advised. Other than a few <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">farms</ENAMEX>, there is little development until you reach <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Playa Morena</ENAMEX>, with its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX> and souvenir stand. Here the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> makes a sharp left turn to cut across the heart of the island. If you wish to continue north from here (on foot, horseback, or four-wheel drive <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicle</ENAMEX>), you will eventually reach the northern lighthouse at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Punta Molas</ENAMEX>, having passed the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mayan</ENAMEX> ruins of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">El Castillo</ENAMEX> Real along the way. Take the sensible precautions if you make this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">trip¬†‚Äî¬†drinking water</ENAMEX>, sun protection, insect repellent, and an extra layer of clothing are all advisable.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> leading back to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Miguel</ENAMEX>, called the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carretera Transversal</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hosts</ENAMEX> a few souvenir <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stands</ENAMEX> where prices may be a little lower than in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">town¬†‚Äî¬†if you‚Äôre</ENAMEX> prepared to barter. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Six</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">km</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4 miles</NUMEX>) from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Playa Morena</ENAMEX> is the entrance to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">San Gervasio Archaeological Park</ENAMEX>. The remains of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Gervasio</ENAMEX> are located <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">several kilometers</NUMEX> from the site entrance, and though not on the scale of the major <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mayan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">settlements</ENAMEX> of the mainland, the beautiful tropical park environment makes the ruins worth exploring. Most structures date from the post-classical period (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1200‚Äì1650</ENAMEX>); the site was still in use when the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> arrived. At the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Estructura Manitas</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Little Hands Structure</ENAMEX>), you can clearly see the red handprints, dating from around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX>, on the inside wall of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX>. From here you can walk the route of a short sacred <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sacb√©</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mayan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>) to the central collection of small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>. One is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Osario</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ossuary Structure</ENAMEX>), where the remains of several <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Maya</ENAMEX> were found. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Some 500</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,524 ft</NUMEX>) behind here is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kana Nah</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tall House</ENAMEX>), which, as its name suggests, is one of the largest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> at the site. It was the main <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX>, where the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">goddess Ix chel</ENAMEX> was worshipped.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South</ENAMEX> to Tulum along theMaya <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Riviera</ENAMEX>
When tourism first came to this area of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yucat√°n</ENAMEX> peninsula, the coastline between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canc√∫n</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tulum</ENAMEX> was a pristine natural landscape, broken only by a few <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX>. Rocky coastal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">inlets</ENAMEX> where sea-water mingles with the fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> of several cenotes are separated by <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">acres</NUMEX> of virgin mangrove. Parts of the coastline have sandy beaches that seem as if no human has ever set foot on them.
Of course with the success of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canc√∫n</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">developers</ENAMEX> have looked for other opportunities in the region, and this stretch of coastline is gradually being taken for tourist development. Luckily, not every development mimics the grand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canc√∫n</ENAMEX>, and there is some variety here, in both style and atmosphere; there are a number of all-inclusive hotel <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX>, yet there are also interesting <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ports</ENAMEX>. Tulum, with its magnificent <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mayan</ENAMEX> ruins, forms a natural southerly point to the strip of coastal development, which has been given the name <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚ÄúThe Maya Riviera</ENAMEX>.‚Äù
The area is easy to explore by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicle</ENAMEX>, as the road following the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">coastline¬†‚Äî¬†though</ENAMEX> in some places <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a few kilometers</NUMEX> inland from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">it¬†‚Äî¬†is</ENAMEX> in good condition; around <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> is a four-lane <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">highway</ENAMEX> opened in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>. There is also an excellent bus service linking the major <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">settlements</ENAMEX> and large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX>, which takes <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">around two hours</TIMEX> to run the whole length of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Riviera</ENAMEX>.
Traveling south from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canc√∫n</ENAMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> town you will pass, at <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">36 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">22 miles</NUMEX>), is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Morelos</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX> for vehicle ferries to the island of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cozumel</ENAMEX>. A <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX><TIMEX TYPE="TIME">-minute</TIMEX> journey from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canc√</ENAMEX>∫n is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tres R√≠os</ENAMEX>, a natural reserve with <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> for snorkeling, kayaking, and horseback riding. Further south, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Playa del Carmen</ENAMEX>, once a tiny settlement, is now the fastest growing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> in the area. For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many years</TIMEX> Playa was simply a stepping-stone to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cozumel</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">only a 40-minute</TIMEX> boat ride away¬†‚Äî¬†in fact the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> along <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Cozumel‚Äôs coastline</ENAMEX> can clearly be seen from the town <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">jetty</ENAMEX>. But the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, sitting on a wonderful pale-sand beach with clear, bright azure <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, has become an attraction in itself. It now boasts several large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> and a pretty traffic-free street one block west of the strand, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calle</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>, where the souvenir <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX>, caf√©s, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bars</ENAMEX> spill out into the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>. As day turns to <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>, music from rock to <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">reggae</ENAMEX> floats in the air. All this gives the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> a rather bohemian atmosphere.
Beyond Playa the coastline is most dramatic; the limestone has been eroded into several coastal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">inlets</ENAMEX>, lagoons, and riverbeds. This stretch is excellent for snorkeling and has some exciting cenotes for diving and swimming; as well, a number of these inlets have been protected as national <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX> or developed as pleasure <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">playgrounds</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX>. Around <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 km</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6 miles</NUMEX>) south of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Playa del Carmen</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Xcaret</ENAMEX> (pronounced shkaret) is the largest and the most organized <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX>, with a range of activities and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> to enjoy. Xcaret, or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äúlittle inlet</ENAMEX>,‚Äù is an award-winning example of a sustainable tourist development. Once the site of an ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mayan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port</ENAMEX> for departures to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cozumel</ENAMEX>, the sheltered lagoon was the perfect protection for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mayan</ENAMEX> canoes. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX> of the nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cenote</ENAMEX> were used for ritual purification before pilgrims made the short sea journey to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ix-chel¬†‚Äî¬†the</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">goddess</ENAMEX> of fertility and childbirth. The remains of several temples can be found in the park grounds.
When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Xcaret</ENAMEX> opened in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX>, the cenote and its outlet to the sea (a mixture of narrow gorge and underground <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tunnel</ENAMEX>) were the focus of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>; they made an exciting snorkeling or swimming tour. Today this is still a popular attraction, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> has grown to include sheltered swimming, a beautiful beach, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, tropical gardens, horseback-riding <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">trails</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">magnificent butterfly pavilion</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">zoo</ENAMEX>, an aquarium, and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúswim</ENAMEX> with the dolphins‚Äù program. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> is also contributing to a number of projects protecting endangered <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> including the green <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">turtle</ENAMEX> and several <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">parrot species</ENAMEX>. As <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> falls, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xcaret</ENAMEX> holds a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äúspectaculars‚Äù</ENAMEX> which are both entertaining and educational. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mayan</ENAMEX> rituals are re-enacted at the ancient sites, and a folkloric ballet offers traditional dances from different regions in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Puerto Aventuras</ENAMEX> is an interesting development, unlike any place else on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Maya Riviera</ENAMEX>. The rocky coastal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">inlets</ENAMEX> have been transformed into a magnificent <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">marina</ENAMEX>, with mooring for yachts and motor launches and a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">walkway</ENAMEX> along the waterside. Sympathetic <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>- and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">three-story</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pastel painted buildings</ENAMEX> line the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">marina</ENAMEX>, with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> at ground level. The whole area has the feel of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rivera</ENAMEX> rather than <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean Mexico</ENAMEX>. At the center of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX>, in the sheltered waters of the inner lagoon, there is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚ÄúSwim</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dolphins‚</ENAMEX>Äù program. Just beside the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dolphin pools</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museo CEDAM</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Club de Exploraci√≥n y Deporte Acu√°tico de M√©xico</ENAMEX>), which is dedicated to a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pioneers</ENAMEX> of underwater archaeology and exploration. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> has a wooden floor covered in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sand</ENAMEX>, which adds a touch of the nautical as you wander among the exhibits. Interesting finds from the ocean <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">floor¬†‚Äî¬†Mayan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX>-colonial, and more modern <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">artifacts¬†‚Äî¬†combine</ENAMEX> with displays of early diving equipment. You will also see stunning photographs of underwater environments taken by leading practicians of the art.
Just south of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Aventuras</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Xel-Ha</ENAMEX>, a network of mangrove, waterways, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pools</ENAMEX>, and caves that was once a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mayan</ENAMEX> site. The majority of the remains form an archaeological site on the inland side of the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">highway</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Xel-Ha Park</ENAMEX> sits on the seaward side. This <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> has more natural areas than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xcaret</ENAMEX> for snorkeling and exploring, but fewer organized activities, though there is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúswim</ENAMEX> with the dolphins‚Äù program. At either side of this managed <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> are public inlets; at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Akumal</ENAMEX> you can snorkel just off the sand, or rent a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> to take you out to the reef.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tulum</ENAMEX> is the most southerly destination of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">convoy</ENAMEX> of tourist buses departing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canc√∫n.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">Buses</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> park <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">some 700 m</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1‚ÅÑ2 mile</NUMEX>) from the entrance. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">shuttle bus</ENAMEX> will carry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> to the entrance for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">US$1</NUMEX> if you don‚Äôt feel energetic enough for the walk.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mayan</ENAMEX> ruins here are a magnet for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> both for their architectural significance and their beautiful setting, being the only site fronting the open sea. Tulum was built late in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mayan</ENAMEX> history, during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 12th century</TIMEX>, and was still thriving in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 15th and 16th centuries</TIMEX> when other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mayan</ENAMEX> sites had been abandoned. This was a time of great upheaval, so the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maya</ENAMEX> built their temples close together and surrounded them with a strong defensive wall¬<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">†‚Äî¬†the</ENAMEX> name <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tulum</ENAMEX> actually means ‚Äúwalled‚Äù or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúfenced.‚Äù The walls acted as a defense later in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mayan</ENAMEX> history during the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">War of the Castes</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1847</TIMEX>), when several rebel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maya</ENAMEX> brought their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> to hide out here.
There are no great <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> on the scale of those at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chich√©n Itz√</ENAMEX>° or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Uxmal</ENAMEX>, but several sit on rocky <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outcrops</ENAMEX> overlooking the fine sandy beach and clear blue <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> below, making the place a photographer‚Äôs delight. Chief among these is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">El Castillo</ENAMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Castle</ENAMEX>), the main <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX>. Tulum was dedicated to the worship of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Descending God</ENAMEX>, who can be seen in carvings and stucco <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">reliefs</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">El Castillo</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> at the site¬†‚Äî¬†though many details have been lost to the elements and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX> air. He is depicted as a winged figure, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> below and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">two feet</NUMEX> above. It is not clear what this god‚Äôs role was within <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mayan</ENAMEX> worship; he may represent the setting sun, as many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">temples</ENAMEX> at the site, including <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">El Castillo</ENAMEX>, face west. A few steps northwest of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">El Castillo</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Templo del Dios Descendente</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Temple of the Descending God</ENAMEX>), of note because it was deliberately built with walls and doors out of plumb.
Between the site entrance and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">El Castillo</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Templo de los Frescos</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Frescoes or Paintings</ENAMEX>) has the best-preserved reliefs at the site, and a rather worn stela fronting the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">fa√ßade</ENAMEX>. At each corner of the west-facing wall it is possible to discern a somber mask with large eyes and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lips¬†‚Äî¬†possibly</ENAMEX> a depiction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kukulk√°n.</ENAMEX> Above the columned entrance are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> niches, each with a relief of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Descending God</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>. Red handprints decorate the small upper <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>, and inside there are fine frescoes dating from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 13th century</TIMEX>, but it is not possible to enter the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> to see them.
You can sunbathe on the beach at the site; some <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> spend <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> here, something the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maya</ENAMEX> would never have been able to do when it was a religious <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>. Only those who belonged to the upper and religious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">castes</ENAMEX> were allowed into its inner sanctum.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Downtown Tulum</ENAMEX> has the decided feeling of a frontier <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, and beyond¬†‚Äî¬†towards the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state capital</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chetumal¬</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">†‚Äî¬†the road</ENAMEX> is in worse condition than farther north. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kilometers</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about a mile</NUMEX>) east of downtown, along the coast, a hotel <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">zone</ENAMEX> is being developed for those who want spend longer than a day in the region to explore the less populated areas, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sian Ka‚Äôan Biosphere Reserve</ENAMEX> to the south.
Inland from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tulum</ENAMEX> is another <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mayan</ENAMEX> site worthy of note. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cob√°</ENAMEX> sits surrounded by jungle some <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">42 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">26 miles</NUMEX>) from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tulum</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lake Cob√°</ENAMEX>. It is one of the largest <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mayan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX>, said by archaeologists to be <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100 square km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">39 square miles</NUMEX>) in area, and encompasses around <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20,000</NUMEX> separate structures¬†‚Äî¬†though most have not been excavated. It is thought that at its peak (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">a.d. 800‚Äì100</ENAMEX>), it was one of the most important <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mayan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">kingdom</ENAMEX>, with a network of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX> reaching to many satellite settlements, some <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">up to 100 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">62 miles</NUMEX>) away.
At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cob√</ENAMEX>° it is possible to feel a little as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stephens</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Catherwood</ENAMEX> did when they discovered the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mayan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> in their expeditions of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1841</TIMEX>. Most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pyramids</ENAMEX> and temples still lie under centuries of debris and vegetation, tantalizing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> with intricate carvings peeking through roots and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branches</ENAMEX>. Here you can imagine yourself to be exploring where no one except the abundant <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">butterflies</ENAMEX> has been for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX>. Cob√° more than any other site requires sensible footwear, hat, sunscreen, and bottled <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, because the principal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> are spread so widely apart.
The main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> at the site is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iglesia</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>, a huge pyramid <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">nearly 30 m</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">90</NUMEX> ft) high. It sits among a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grupo Cob√°</ENAMEX>, which lie to the right of the main entrance. Its major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">staircase</ENAMEX> has been cleared, and the view from the top is spectacular, with the lakes and jungle stretching out to cover the land. At irregular intervals, vegetation-covered mounds indicate other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pyramids</ENAMEX> yet to be freed. The only other large <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> in view is the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stone fa√</ENAMEX>ßade of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nohoch Mul</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Hill</ENAMEX>) <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minutes‚Äô</ENAMEX> walk away. At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">42 m</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">138 ft</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nohoch Mul</ENAMEX> is the largest <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mayan</ENAMEX> pyramid yet discovered; there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">120</NUMEX> steps to its upper platform. Once there you will find images of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Descending God¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†the same image seen so often at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tulum</ENAMEX>. Between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nohoch Mul</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grupo Cob√</ENAMEX>° is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conjunto de las Pinturas</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paintings Group</ENAMEX>) where you can see the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Pyramid of the Painted Lintel</ENAMEX>, which as the name suggests still bears traces of its original coloring.
West to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chich√©n Itz√°</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M√</ENAMEX>©rida
Traveling west out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canc√∫n</ENAMEX> region transports you almost immediately into a different era. Traces of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> colonial life can be found across the landscape, but more than this, once out in the countryside the life of the agricultural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX> very much resembles that lived by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maya</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries past</TIMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> they still produce numerous <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crops</ENAMEX> on small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">farms</ENAMEX>, but large modern ranches¬†are much more common in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last hundred years</TIMEX> than before.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">highways</ENAMEX> travel west: the four-lane toll <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">highway</ENAMEX> carries traffic halfway across the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yucat√°n</ENAMEX> peninsula in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">around three hours</TIMEX>; the local <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> (in good condition) travels through the countryside and many local <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">settlements</ENAMEX>, which allows the opportunity to view the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> life of the region. Both <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX> are numbered <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">180</NUMEX>, but the local <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> is signposted <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚Äú180 libre‚Äù</NUMEX> (meaning free).
The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> major <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> on the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">180</NUMEX> libre is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Valladolid</ENAMEX>. Founded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1543</TIMEX>, it has Yucat√°n‚Äôs oldest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Bernadino de Siena</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1552</TIMEX>), now outshone by the imposing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Catedral de San Gervasio</ENAMEX> in the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North of Valladolid</ENAMEX> on route <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">295</NUMEX> are the remains of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mayan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ekbal√°m</ENAMEX>, one of the most recent sites to benefit from major archaeological attention. Original stucco can still be found on the fa√ßade of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Great Temple</ENAMEX> here, and this has been augmented to show how it would have appeared at the zenith of the city‚Äôs development. This helps to gain a better understanding of how other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mayan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> once looked at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tulum</ENAMEX>. Beyond <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Valladolid</ENAMEX> are the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grutas de Balancanch√©</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Balancanch√© Caves</ENAMEX>), which were only rediscovered in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1959</TIMEX> after being abandoned by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maya</ENAMEX>. The huge caverns with underground lakes were a place of offering, and evidence of incense burning can still be found.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chich√©n Itz√</ENAMEX>°
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Three hours</TIMEX> of traveling will bring you to the small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pist√©</ENAMEX> and the remains of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the most famous <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mayan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chich√©n Itz√°</ENAMEX> has fired the imagination of archaeologists and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> alike. No matter how many other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> happen to be there when you visit, you cannot help but be impressed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chich√©n Itz√°.</ENAMEX> It has been well excavated and the huge range of structures give a lasting impression of how life would have been lived by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mayan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elite</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> was built late in the empire‚Äôs cycle, between the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">sixth</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">ninth</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX> (the post<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">-Classic</ENAMEX> period). Despite large amount of research, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> are still not in agreement as to exactly how the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> evolved, and what influences came to bear. What is certain is that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toltec</ENAMEX> influences, in the form of the god <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kukulk√°n</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quetzalcoatl</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chaac-Mool</ENAMEX> reliefs, can be found here, along with traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mayan</ENAMEX> symbols. Another mystery yet to be solved is why the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toltec</ENAMEX> abandoned the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1200</TIMEX>.
Some <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">time</TIMEX> later, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 13th century</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Itz√°</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mayan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tribe</ENAMEX> led by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ruler</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Itz√°mna</ENAMEX>, moved north out of what is now the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Campeche</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX> to the tip of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yucat√°n</ENAMEX> and settled in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. They gave the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> the name <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Chich√©n Itz√°</ENAMEX>; this probably means <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚ÄúMouth of the Well of the Itz√°s</ENAMEX>.‚Äù They founded a capital at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mayapan</ENAMEX>, near the site of the modern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M√©rida.</ENAMEX> In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 15th century</TIMEX>, following a bloody civil war, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Itz√°s</ENAMEX> abandoned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chich√©n Itz√°.</ENAMEX> It had already been reclaimed by the jungle when the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> set foot on the peninsula.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chich√©n Itz√</ENAMEX>° occupies <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6 square km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4 square miles</NUMEX>). If you want to explore all corners of the site, a visit will occupy <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a full day</TIMEX>. Excursions from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canc√</ENAMEX>∫n are popular but can be tiring. It is far better to stay near the site and begin your visit early, because you can start when <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> is cooler, and you will be able to see at least some of the site before the tour <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> arrive. Those who stay overnight can also enjoy the sound-and-light show that takes place <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</TIMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> distinct sectors. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Old Chich√©n</ENAMEX>, in the south, is purely Puuc-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mayan</ENAMEX> in style (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">66</NUMEX>), having <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chambers</ENAMEX> with arched stone roofs. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Chich√©n</ENAMEX> has distinct <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toltec</ENAMEX> influences; here stone columns supported roofs constructed with wooden beams. This allowed <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> in new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Chich√</ENAMEX>©n to be much larger than in the older part of the site, but it also meant that as the wood rotted, the roofs of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chambers</ENAMEX> collapsed, leaving these structures much less intact in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the present day</TIMEX>.
You can visit the site unaccompanied or hire a guide at the entrance; they charge <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">around $30</NUMEX> for a group of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. You will also find a book and gift <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX>, and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> with finds from the site and a model of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> to help you to get your bearings.
As you enter the site (in the new part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>) the huge square edifice of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">El Castillo</ENAMEX>, also called the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pyramid of Kukulk√°n</ENAMEX>, comes into view on your right. The pyramid, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 m</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">100 ft</ENAMEX>) high and the main time-keeping mechanism of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, was built very precisely in position, shape, and height in order to predict the planting and harvesting cycles. There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">364</NUMEX> steps in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">staircases</ENAMEX>, which together represent the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">365 days of the year</TIMEX>. There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">52</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panels</ENAMEX> on each side, which echo the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">52-year</TIMEX> cycle of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mayan</ENAMEX> calendar, and terraces that parallel the main staircase, representing the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18-month</TIMEX> solar cycle. The best time to see this super-sized timepiece in action is at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spring Equinox</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21 March</TIMEX>) or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fall Equinox</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September</TIMEX>) in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the afternoon</TIMEX>, when the sun‚Äôs rays fall down the northern stairway and hit the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">serpent</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> at the base. With the play of light and shadow, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">serpent</ENAMEX> appears to wriggle down into the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">earth</ENAMEX>. For the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maya</ENAMEX>, this signified the re-fertilization of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">land¬†‚Äî¬†and</ENAMEX> time to plant the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">corn</ENAMEX>. The light then leaves the snake head <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> and travels back up from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base</ENAMEX>; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maya</ENAMEX> believed that the power of the sun was returning to the realm of the gods in the sky.
It is possible to climb one of the steep <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">staircases</ENAMEX> to the upper <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platform</ENAMEX>, which has a number of small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chambers</ENAMEX>. The view from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platform</ENAMEX> is spectacular; look down on other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> on the site and also out to the distance, with low <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Yucatecan</ENAMEX> jungle stretching as far as the eye can see. Take care when you descend the staircase, as the treads are narrow.
Inside <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">El Castillo</ENAMEX> are the foundations of an earlier structure, and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX> containing the figure of a jaguar decorated with jade, along with a statue of \, the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Rain God</ENAMEX>.
To the left of the main entrance is the huge, open, main juego de pelota (ball <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX>), one of the best preserved in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Central America</ENAMEX>. Although one of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> on the site, it is definitely the most impressive, with walls <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">8 m</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX> ft) high, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">83 m</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">272 ft</ENAMEX>) long, and set <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30 m</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">98</NUMEX> ft) apart. The walls are decorated with friezes showing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX> dressed in protective clothing and a rather bloodthirsty <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">victor</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of a losing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">player</ENAMEX> (though some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">archaeologists</ENAMEX> believe that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">victor</ENAMEX> had the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúhonor‚Äù</ENAMEX> of losing his life at the end of the match). This ball <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> has been well studied by archaeologists; ball <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX> can be found in most <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mesoamerican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">settlements</ENAMEX>, but the true purpose of the games is still not fully understood.
There are temples at each end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX>, which add to the superb acoustics:¬†it is possible to hear a voice speaking at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one end</TIMEX> clearly at the other, and the whole complex has a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX>-repeat echo, a sacred number in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mayan</ENAMEX> society. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> attached to the eastern wall, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Templo de los Jaguares</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguars</ENAMEX>), is named in honor of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">jaguar</ENAMEX> figures carved on the upper <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panels</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> and a statue of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">jaguar</ENAMEX> in the lower <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX>. The carving to its left is said to depict the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mayan</ENAMEX> creation myth.
Next to the ball <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tzompantli</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Skulls</ENAMEX>, with long rows of skulls carved into its main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platform</ENAMEX>. It is said that here the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> of sacrifice had their severed heads impaled on poles for the edification of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">gods</ENAMEX>. Beside this is the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Plataforma de las √Åguilas</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Platform of the Eagles</ENAMEX>), with reliefs of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eagles</ENAMEX> and jaguars¬†clutching human hearts. Equidistant between <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">El Castillo</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Skulls</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Templo de Venus</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Venus</ENAMEX>) depicts the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">goddess</ENAMEX> as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">feathered serpent</ENAMEX> devouring a human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX>.
From the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Temple of Venus</ENAMEX>, a sacred <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">causeway¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†now little more than a dirt <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">track¬†‚Äî¬†was</ENAMEX> once a paved <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">highway</ENAMEX> to one of the most important religious <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, the natural feature which may have given the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> its name. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cenote Sagrado</ENAMEX>, a limestone waterhole, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">60 m</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">90</NUMEX> ft) in diameter and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">21 m</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">69</NUMEX> ft) from rim to water level, was not a fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> supply for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>; it had a much more chilling use. When archaeologists dredged the hole, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of human bones, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mayan</ENAMEX> ritual of appeasement to the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">gods</ENAMEX>, were found. The skeletons of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> gave the cenote its other name, the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Well of Sacrifice</ENAMEX>.
To the east of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Temple of Venus</ENAMEX> is, perhaps, the most striking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> on the site, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Templo de los Guerreros</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warriors</ENAMEX>). Named for the reliefs depicting <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mayan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">warriors</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> also has numerous columns, putting <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> in mind of a classical <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> edifice. On a platform above the columns is a carved figure of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Chaac-Mool</ENAMEX> in reclining position, its belly hollowed into a bowl to receive offerings¬†‚Äî¬†some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> think these included human hearts fresh from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>. Unfortunately, at the present time the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platform</ENAMEX> is not open to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>.
Reached through a colonnaded <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">walkway</ENAMEX> abutting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Warriors</ENAMEX> is what modern archaeologists have named the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mercado or Market</ENAMEX>, with the remains of steam <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">baths</ENAMEX> and a number of ball <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX>. Just south of the market are the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tracks</ENAMEX> of the modern <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> (now diverted) that once cut through the site. Beyond this are remains to the south and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">west¬†‚Äî¬†Old Chich√©n</ENAMEX>. Directly ahead is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tumba del Gran Sacerdote</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Tomb of the High Priest</ENAMEX>) built atop a limestone cave where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">human</ENAMEX> sacrifices were carried out. Several small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">temples</ENAMEX> can be found here. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Casa de los Metates</ENAMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House of the Grinding Stones</ENAMEX>) is named after the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">corn</ENAMEX>-grinding stones of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maya</ENAMEX>, which are used in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> in the region in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the present day</TIMEX>. Several were found here when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">archaeologists</ENAMEX> investigated the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>. Chichan-chob (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Little Holes</ENAMEX>, also called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Red House</ENAMEX>) is an older-style <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puuc</ENAMEX> style. It has small holes in the roof and masks of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Chaac-Mool</ENAMEX> on the upper walls.
Beyond a small ball <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX>, you will see the imposing building of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">observatory</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Caracol</ENAMEX>. An important place for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhabitants</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, observations taken here would predict the exact times of the equinoxes and important celestial events. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">El Caracol</ENAMEX> means ‚Äúthe snail‚Äù in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Spanish</TIMEX>; it was given its name by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">explorer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Lloyd Stephens</ENAMEX>, because he thought that the spiral staircase on the inside of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dome</ENAMEX> mimicked the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX> of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">snail shell</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Edificio de las Monjas</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Edifice of the Nuns</ENAMEX>), lying farthest south, is perhaps the most <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Puuc</ENAMEX> in style (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">66</NUMEX>) of all the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> here. It stands on the site of much older <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> that can be seen in the interior. Nearby is a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> called, surprisingly, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">La Iglesia</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Church</ENAMEX>). It isn‚Äôt a place of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worship¬</ENAMEX>†‚Äî¬†in fact it is one of the oldest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> on the site, and pays homage to the bacah, a group of gods thought to have held up the sky. Images of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">snail</ENAMEX> and tortoise can be seen here, among others. The walls of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Akab Dzib</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Obscure Writing</ENAMEX>, to the east of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Church</ENAMEX>, are filled with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mayan</ENAMEX> glyphs,¬†the written language of the people¬†that has been the focus of much attention and research in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last 30 years</TIMEX>.
Other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Old Chich√©n</ENAMEX> lie in the scrubland to the south of these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX>, but exploration is more difficult and you may benefit from having a guide. 
Izamal
Further west is the small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Izamal</ENAMEX>. The settlement is known as ‚Äúthe <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">three cultures‚</NUMEX>Äù because, perhaps more than anywhere in the region, you can find <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mayan</ENAMEX>, colonial, and modern influences together in the city <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>. At the heart of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monastery</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Antonio de Padua</ENAMEX>, home to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Franciscan</ENAMEX> order and founded by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Archbishop</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Landa</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the 16th century</TIMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> monks continuing the tradition, though only their inner sanctum is out of bounds, leaving you free to explore the small courtyards and chapels. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pope John Paul II</ENAMEX> visited the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monastery</ENAMEX>, conducting a mass here. A small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> has photographs of his visit, along with a papal throne built especially for the occasion.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monastery</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> on the surrounding <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets¬†‚Äî¬†rows</ENAMEX> of old colonial houses¬†‚Äî¬†have been painted a bright yellow, one of the traditional colors used by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">settlers</ENAMEX>. You can take a calesa ride through the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> and visit the remains of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mayan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Kinichkakmo¬†(‚Äúthe</ENAMEX> face of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">maker</ENAMEX> of the sun‚Äù), which is the largest pyramid in the region, though few have been excavated.
M√©rida
The largest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yucat√°n</ENAMEX> peninsula and capital of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yucat√°n</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Blanca M√©rida</ENAMEX> was founded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1640s</TIMEX>, at the very start of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">occupation</ENAMEX>, on the site of a large <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mayan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T‚ÄôHo.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M√©rida</ENAMEX> became the focus of influence for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Montejo</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, who exerted their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> over the surrounding countryside. Since that time, it has seen the ebb and flow of economic prosperity and political power, yet its architecture and lifestyle¬†‚Äî¬†a total contrast to modern <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Canc√∫n¬†‚Äî¬†make</ENAMEX> it a fascinating place to visit. M√©rida is a vibrant, bustling <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> with a tangible energy. It also has interesting attractions that can fill <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few days</TIMEX> of your itinerary.
The heart of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Plaza Major</ENAMEX> (also known by a variety of names such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plaza des Armas</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Plaza Principal</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plaza de la Independencia</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plaza de la Revolucion</ENAMEX>). Its tree-lined <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> has shaded seats where everyone comes to meet and talk; shoe-shine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> work throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX>, while ice-cream <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sellers</ENAMEX> stand on street <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">corners</ENAMEX> with their small barrows. Look out for the confidenciales, or love seats, where courting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couples</ENAMEX> could sit next to each other without compromising the woman‚Äôs reputation. In the center of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> is a flagpole supporting a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> flag, which is raised and lowered at the start and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">end of each day</TIMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6am and 6pm</TIMEX>) in an elaborate ceremony undertaken by the local police <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">band</ENAMEX>. Numerous historic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>, dating back to the very earliest <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> rule, line the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> and its surrounding grid of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>. Construction of many of these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> used <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stones</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mayan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T‚ÄôHo</ENAMEX>, so, alas, nothing remains of this site.
Perhaps the most important building is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palacio de Montejo</ENAMEX>, on the south side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>. It was built as a family <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montejo</ENAMEX> dynasty and was completed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1549</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fa√ßade¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†now the only original element of the house¬†‚Äî¬†is decorated with a number of ornate carvings, including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> large conquistadors seen treading on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heads</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mayan Indians</ENAMEX>. Perhaps this decoration was added to reaffirm <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montejo</ENAMEX> power in the region. Major renovations to the fa√ßade were completed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late 1999</TIMEX>. The style of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> is pure <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish</ENAMEX>-colonial, with an inner <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard garden</ENAMEX> lined by <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> with high ceilings and huge wooden doors. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> was in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Montejo</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1970s</TIMEX> but then passed into the hands of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX>, which now operates a regional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATM</ENAMEX>, and currency exchange in the interior. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Visitors</ENAMEX> can wander into the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX>, but many of the architectural treasures are off-limits.
On the west of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palacio Municipal</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">City Hall</ENAMEX>), painted a pretty yellow in contrast with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>. Inside you can see the wooden-lined <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sala de Cabildos</ENAMEX>, where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> still holds its regular meetings. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">northern</ENAMEX> section is taken up by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palacio del Gobierno</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Governor‚Äôs Palace</ENAMEX>), now merely an administrative <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>, but once the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Governor‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX>. In the inner <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX> hang many large canvases by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fernando Castro Pancheco</ENAMEX> illustrating important incidents and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yucat√°n‚Äôs</ENAMEX> history. On the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Salon de Historia</ENAMEX>, a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">long</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">gallery room</ENAMEX> once used for social soir√©es, has more paintings that complete the collection.
The eastern side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> is dominated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catedral</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1561</TIMEX>), one of the oldest in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Americas</ENAMEX>. Inside you will find the large crucifix christened <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cristo de las Ampollas</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christ</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blisters</ENAMEX>) which has been on display here since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1645</TIMEX>. It was carved in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1500s</TIMEX> out of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wood</ENAMEX> from a <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">miraculous tree</ENAMEX>, so called because it had caught fire but did not burn. Later the finished crucifix survived another disastrous fire, though its surface was blistered. Behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Catedral on Calle 61</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museo de la Ciudad</ENAMEX>, which displays drawings, maps, plans, and photographs relating to the planning and growth of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M√©rida.</ENAMEX>
Next to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catedral</ENAMEX>, on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>, is <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Museo de Arte Contempor√°neo Ateneo de Yucat√°n</ENAMEX> (MACAY) which occupies a colonial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> at the site of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">archbishop‚Äôs palace</ENAMEX>, now destroyed. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">gallery</ENAMEX> exhibits the best in modern art, with permanent exhibitions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yucatecan</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX>, and a comprehensive program of temporary exhibitions. Further works by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fernando Castro Pancheco</ENAMEX> can be seen here, including some of his early pieces.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Plaza Major</ENAMEX> sits in a square between calles <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60 and 62</TIMEX> (even street numbers travel <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">east‚Äìwest</ENAMEX>) and calles <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">61 and 63</TIMEX> (odd street numbers travel <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">north‚Äìsouth</ENAMEX>); the surrounding <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> boast numerous colonial gems that can only be appreciated by strolling around the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>. For those with little time to spare, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Calle 60</ENAMEX> has the greatest concentrated collection. Walk north past the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Governor‚Äôs Palace</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three or four</NUMEX> blocks, to take in the wrought-iron‚Äìwork detail, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">balconies</ENAMEX> and walls of tropical-colored stucco that warms as <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the afternoon</TIMEX> sun begins to mellow.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">block</ENAMEX> north of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Plaza</ENAMEX> Mayor you will find the tiny <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Parque Cepeda Peraza</ENAMEX>, bounded on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> side by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iglesia de Jes√∫s</ENAMEX>, built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 17th century</TIMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jesuit</ENAMEX> order. Beyond the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> is another small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Parque Morelos</ENAMEX>, which has a sculpture of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚ÄúMother and Child,‚Äù¬†a copy of the Renoir</ENAMEX> piece found in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Teatro Pe√≥n Contreras</ENAMEX> occupies the northern corner of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>, with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parisian</ENAMEX>-style caf√© and city tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> on its <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX> and a regular schedule of performances. The theatre is a splendid example of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late 19th- early 20th-century</TIMEX> architecture, with a sweeping marble <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">staircase</ENAMEX> leading to a colonnaded upper balcony. Across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Universidad de Yucat√°n</ENAMEX>; one block farther north is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parque Santa Luc√≠a.</ENAMEX>
If you are walking, take a right at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calle</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX> past <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Parque Santa Anna</ENAMEX>, then left at the traffic signal. This is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paseo Montejo</ENAMEX>, one of the finest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, known by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M√</ENAMEX>©rida as <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">‚Äúthe Champs-Elys√®es of Yucat√°n</ENAMEX>.‚Äù This tree-lined <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">avenue</ENAMEX> was the place to live during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th century</TIMEX>, and all the best <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> and rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">henequen producers</ENAMEX> vied for the best plots along its length. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> they built still have an elegance and stature, though many were lost to modern development, replaced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> and bank <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> in the latter <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past century</TIMEX>.
The most impressive of the remaining period <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palacio Canton</ENAMEX>, which now houses the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Museo Regional de Antropolog√≠a e Historia</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Regional Anthropological and History Museum</ENAMEX>). The beautiful plasterwork detail and marble <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floors</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> are only surpassed by the wealth of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mayan</ENAMEX> artifacts on display. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> displays illustrate the most recent theories on <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mayan</ENAMEX> society¬†‚Äî¬†so much of which is still <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">conjecture¬†‚Äî ¬</ENAMEX>†including trade patterns and social <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">customs</ENAMEX>. On the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> floor of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>, exhibitions relate the methods used to excavate various <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> around <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yucat√°n.</ENAMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> is an excellent starting point for your tour of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mayan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">North</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>, at a major intersection on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paseo</ENAMEX>, is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monumento</ENAMEX> a la <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Patria</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monument</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fatherland</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Monument</ENAMEX>). This huge limestone monument depicting <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mayan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> themes was begun in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1944</TIMEX> and completed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1956</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M√©rida</ENAMEX> holds artistic and folkloric performances on <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">every night</TIMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the week</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">an ‚Äúall-day‚Äù</NUMEX> event in the heart of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sundays</TIMEX>. See the ‚ÄúWhat to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Do‚Äù</ENAMEX> section for more details.
Although the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mayan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T‚ÄôHo</ENAMEX> has been completely swallowed by colonial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">M√©rida</ENAMEX>, a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10-minute</TIMEX> taxi ride north of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dzibilchalt√∫n</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> that thrived from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3000</TIMEX> b.c. on a marine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">economy¬†‚Äî¬†the</ENAMEX> coast being only <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">32 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20 miles</NUMEX>) away. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Archaeologists</ENAMEX> believe that at its peak in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late Classical period</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">a.d. 600‚Äì900</ENAMEX>) the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> reached <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20,000</NUMEX>, and that the function of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> changed over time from ceremonial to urban.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">El Templo de las Siete Mu√±ecas</ENAMEX> (called the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Doll‚Äôs House</ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>) is the most interesting <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> at the site; it is the only <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mayan</ENAMEX> building with windows to be found so far, though these are not thought simply to have provided light for the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>. The openings together with the doors frame the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> segments of the sky marked by the solstices, the equinoxes, and the zenith. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">archaeologists</ENAMEX> were excavating the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> they found <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> small clay dolls, each with a bodily deformity. No one is sure whether these were simply a child‚Äôs toys or if they had a religious significance, but they gave the structure its name. The dolls are on display at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> found just beyond the site entrance.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Uxmal</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Puuc Route</ENAMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> to the south of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M√</ENAMEX>©rida is known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Puuc</ENAMEX> (pronounced <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚Äúpook‚Äù</ENAMEX>). It has the highest ground in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yucat√°n</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚ÄúSierrita Puuc‚Äù¬†‚Äî¬†a ridge</ENAMEX> of limestone hills <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">50 m</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">150 ft</ENAMEX>) in height, and thought to be the edge of a giant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">crater</ENAMEX> formed when a meteorite fell to earth <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> the land is home to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mayan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX>, but the jungle has relinquished a number of fine ancient sites to explore. These <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> are called the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Puuc</ENAMEX>, and this name has also been taken to describe the characteristics of the architecture and design of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> here. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puuc</ENAMEX> style is characterized by latticework carving on the lower fa√ßades, with masks and carvings on the upper levels.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mayan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">settlements</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Puuc region</ENAMEX> were extremely rich in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Classical</ENAMEX> and post-Classical times because the soil has always been extremely fertile. It produced, and in fact still does, several <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">crops</ENAMEX> each year, where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX> on the lowland (the rest of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yucat√°n</ENAMEX>) could only produce <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or maybe <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>. The surpluses produced allowed the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX> to support artisans such as stonemasons¬†‚Äî¬†making the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> here very ornate¬†‚Äî¬†and to trade with other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> for goods and raw materials not naturally available in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Puuc</ENAMEX> region.
The route south from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M√</ENAMEX>©rida is the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeche</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of same name. You‚Äôll travel through countryside once filled with haciendas (old colonial farms very much like <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plantations</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX>). When the henequen boom was at its height, the number of haciendas grew dramatically, but when the system was dismantled in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1937</TIMEX> most fell into decline. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hacienda</ENAMEX> consisted of a main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> surrounded by its land, a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factory</ENAMEX>, and a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> for the hacienda <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>. This would include a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company store</ENAMEX> where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> were forced to buy their supplies. Many of the modern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> of this region have their roots in the hacienda system. As you pass through them you may see an old chimney breaking above the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> line, a sure sign that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> was once part of a hacienda.
Turn off at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">route 261</ENAMEX> and at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">km 33</TIMEX> you will find <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hacienda Yaxcopoil</ENAMEX>, one of the oldest in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Yucat√°n</ENAMEX> and now a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> dedicated to the old lifestyle. The main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> dates from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th century</TIMEX> and has been owned by the present <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1864</TIMEX>. The whole site is faded and aging, yet it is still possible to discern vestiges of its glory days. It was one of the earliest and largest henequen <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> in operation and the old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factory</ENAMEX> engines can still be seen, along with stock <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> and tool <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> surrounded by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">present-day</TIMEX> crops growing in the fields. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> stopped processing its own <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">crops</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1984</TIMEX>. The hacienda <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> still operates¬<ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">†‚Äî¬†but</ENAMEX> now as a state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">owner</ENAMEX> intends to preserve but not renovate the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>, allowing the past to tell its story.
Although many think <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chich√©n Itz√</ENAMEX>° outshines it in size, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Uxmal</ENAMEX> is considered the jewel of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mayan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yucat√°n</ENAMEX>, its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> richly decorated with elaborate carvings. At its peak <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between a.d. 600‚Äì900</TIMEX> it is said to have had a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">around 25,000¬†‚Äî¬†remarkable</NUMEX> when you consider that it had no water supply and had to collect and store its needs artificially.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the highlights of the site presents itself immediately as you enter. The magnificent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pir√°mide del Advino</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Pyramid of the Magician</ENAMEX>, also called the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Pyramid of the Dwarf</ENAMEX>) sits atop <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> older <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX>. This pyramid is unique for a number of reasons. It has rounded sides, giving it a softened shape. It‚Äôs steep (even more precipitous than the normal elevations in the area), and the design of the doorway at the top, which is a huge representation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chaac</ENAMEX>, is found at no other site. The fa√ßade of the upper levels is extremely ornate and the main <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">staircase</ENAMEX> has a parallel row of large <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chaac</ENAMEX> masks. It is closed to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> at present, as work continues on exploring the inner <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chambers</ENAMEX>, but it is possible to study the whole fa√ßade from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX> in front of the pyramid.
Next to the pyramid is the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Cuadr√°ngulo de las Monjas</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quadrangle of the Nuns</ENAMEX>), given its name in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16th century</TIMEX> because it resembled a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monastery</ENAMEX> or nunnery. Its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">size¬†‚Äî¬†over 70</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">rooms¬†‚Äî¬†has</ENAMEX> caused archaeologists to postulate that it may have been a military <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">academy</ENAMEX>, which expanded regularly throughout its history. The western <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> has the most richly carved fa√ßade. There are also numerous depictions of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mayan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> or nah, which have changed little since classical times and can still be found all across the countryside of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yucat√°n.</ENAMEX> The eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> has a statue of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dwarf</ENAMEX> dressed in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">turtle shell</ENAMEX> placed in a position normally associated with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rulers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mayan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">serpent</ENAMEX> is entwined all along the upper fa√ßade around the statue. From its upper levels the many <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> at the site come clearly into view. The quadrangle is the setting for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Uxmal Light</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Sound Show</ENAMEX>, which takes place every <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South</ENAMEX> of the quadrangle, beyond a small ball <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX>, the land rises to a higher level. Here another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> forms the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> of focus at the site. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Casa de las Tortugas</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Turtle House</ENAMEX>), so called because of numerous <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">turtle motifs</ENAMEX> adorning it, is found immediately on the right. Beside, and totally dwarfing it, lies the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palacio del Gobernador</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Governor‚Äôs Palace</ENAMEX>) with an imposing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>-m- (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">320-ft-</ENAMEX>) long fa√ßade. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> was erected in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 11th century</TIMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ruler</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Halach Huinic</ENAMEX> (the true <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>), and consists of a central building flanked by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wings</ENAMEX>. The frieze of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chaac</ENAMEX> masks is one of the most ornate and complex in the known <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mayan</ENAMEX> world.
Behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> is The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Great Pyramid</ENAMEX>; it is less ornate than the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX>, and only the front fa√ßade has been excavated. Beyond this area, there are several other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>, many of which have yet to be excavated, including the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dovecote Group</ENAMEX> (which includes the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Casa de las Palomas</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House of Doves</ENAMEX>) and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grupo del Cementario</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cemetery Group</ENAMEX>). Beyond these are several even more remote sites which can be visited, but you would benefit from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">services</ENAMEX> of a guide to find them.
Uxmal was a very rich <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> at the height of its powers and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">protector</ENAMEX> of many smaller settlements, which paid tribute to it both in food and money. A string of these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> now forms what is called the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Puuc Route</ENAMEX>, and they can all be visited in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX>. Though small, each one has something different to reveal.
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX> in the tour is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kabah</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only 27 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">17 miles</NUMEX>) south of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Uxmal</ENAMEX>. The major <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> at the site is the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Codz-Pop or Palace of the Masks</ENAMEX>, constructed in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chenes</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">style¬†‚Äî¬†characterized</ENAMEX> by masks covering the whole fa√ßade of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> from ground to roof. There are said to have been over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Chaac representations¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†a most impressive sight unique in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mayan</ENAMEX> world. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Codz-Pop</ENAMEX> means ‚Äúrolled-up sleeping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mat</ENAMEX>,‚Äù referring to the curled-up nose on the masks. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cross</ENAMEX> the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> dividing the site to find a restored archway, which once marked the end of a sacred <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sacb√©</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mayan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>) from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Uxmal</ENAMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Eight</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kilometers</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 miles</NUMEX>) south of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kabah</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sayil</ENAMEX>, famed for its major <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>, called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">El Palacio</ENAMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palace</ENAMEX>) by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX>. With <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX>, it would be important for its size alone, but the ornate decoration makes it even more impressive, with representations of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Descending God</ENAMEX> found so prominently at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tulum</ENAMEX>.
Nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Xlapak</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> major <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX>, but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Labn√°</ENAMEX>, the final <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Puuc</ENAMEX> site on the tour, has a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> to explore. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">El Palacio</ENAMEX> here is decorated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">alligators</ENAMEX> whose open jaws each have a human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> emerging from them. This <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">symbol</ENAMEX>, called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pop</ENAMEX>, is thought to be indicative of power and is only found at this site. A sacb√© links the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> to other parts of the site. The largest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mirador</ENAMEX>, a pyramid <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20 m</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">65</NUMEX> ft) high. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Visitors</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1900s</TIMEX> found decoration on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>, which has since been worn away or lost. Next to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mirador</ENAMEX> is the most famous sight in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Labn√°</ENAMEX>, also much changed since its discovery. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">El Arco</ENAMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arch</ENAMEX>), is late <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puuc</ENAMEX> style and was thought to have been the entrance to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX> of a family <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX>. Though the arch remains, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> ornate walls at either side of it have collapsed during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 20th century</TIMEX>.
Before leaving the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Puuc</ENAMEX> area, visit the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lolt√∫n Caves</ENAMEX>. The guided tour through these impressive caverns takes <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">90 minutes</TIMEX>; you can see evidence of where the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mayan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rebels</ENAMEX> fortified the entrances during the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">War of the Castes</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1840s</TIMEX>.
