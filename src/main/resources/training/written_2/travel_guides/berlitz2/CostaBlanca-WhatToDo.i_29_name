What to Do
The Bullfight
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Experts</ENAMEX> swear that it takes a lifetime to learn all the subtleties of the corrida, or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiesta brava</ENAMEX>, as the bullfight is known in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>. But don‚Äôt let that discourage you. However you may feel about this controversial sport, it remains very much a part of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> life,
You‚Äôll see the corrida at its most thrilling in the demanding rings of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alicante, Cartagena</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Murcia</ENAMEX>. Top <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">matadors¬†‚Äî¬†qualified toreros</ENAMEX> who fight fully grown <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">half-ton</NUMEX> bulls¬<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">†‚Äî¬†occasionally</ENAMEX> appear in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Benidorm</ENAMEX>, while <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">novice fighters</ENAMEX> can be seen in other tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centres</ENAMEX>. Don‚Äôt underestimate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">newcomers</ENAMEX> to the ring. Among them may be another <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Cordob√</ENAMEX>©s on the way up.
Perhaps the best seats to buy for a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> fight are <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sol y sombra</ENAMEX>, tendido bajo, lower stands in the sun part of the time and in the shade the other. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> rows are the most expensive. Admission prices are lower in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alicante</ENAMEX> than in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Benidorm</ENAMEX>. Tickets everywhere are <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 percent</NUMEX> more than the official price when purchased from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as much as 40 percent</NUMEX> more from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX>. Whether you have booked in advance or not, try to arrive at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">plaza de toros</ENAMEX> with an hour to spare, enough time to watch the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX> and feel the tension rising. The corrida always starts on <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">time¬†‚Äî¬†even</ENAMEX> if the clock occasionally has to be stopped.
The usual <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bulls</ENAMEX>, fought by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> matadors, give an average spectacle of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">21‚ÅÑ2 hours</TIMEX>, so a cushion hired on the spot is a good idea. You should remember that the bullfight is neither a sport nor a competition. It‚Äôs a highly ritualized <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-act art form that depends initially on the aggressiveness of the bull and the torero‚Äôs skill and ability to take risks. No risk, and there would be no bullfight.
Each phase of the fight is closely controlled by the presidente, from his flag-draped <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">box</ENAMEX>. He drops <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> handkerchiefs, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to signal the swaggering parade that precedes the fight, and the other to release the first <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bull</ENAMEX> from the puerta de toriles, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">matador‚Äôs ‚Äúgate</ENAMEX> of fear,‚Äù for the opening act or <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> tercio. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bull</ENAMEX> is played with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">magenta capes¬†‚Äî¬†first</ENAMEX> by the matador‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX>, or cuadrilla, then by the matador himself. All the time the torero is assessing the bull, noting his temperament, how he charges, and how he uses his horns.
The picador‚Äôs moment comes during the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> tercio, when he rides into the ring on a horse protected by padding. His task is to lance the bull‚Äôs huge shoulder muscles; it‚Äôs unattractive but necessary, both to weaken the bull and to lower his head for the kill. Too much lance, and the picador ruins the fight. Too little, and he gives the torero an impossible task.
Now banderillas¬<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">†‚Äî¬†long</ENAMEX>, ribboned, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steel</ENAMEX>-tipped <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">darts¬†‚Äî¬†are</ENAMEX> plunged into the bull‚Äôs shoulders. In a moment of grace and athleticism, the banderillero, or even the matador himself, runs obliquely across the path of the bull, barely pausing as he jack-knifes over the horns to thrust home the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">darts</ENAMEX>. 
The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> and final tercio is known as la <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">suerte</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de la</ENAMEX> muerte or the ‚Äúact of death.‚Äù The torero steps alone into the ring and plays the bull with the small, red cape, or muleta¬†‚Äî¬†taunting him, calling him, passing those horns within <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">inches</NUMEX> of his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ol√©s</ENAMEX> and crescendos from the band mean the matador is doing well, but if you hear whistles and the cry ¬°fuera! (out!), you‚Äôll know he‚Äôs struggling.
At the moment of highest tension, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">matador</ENAMEX> leans over the horns to thrust his <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">sword</ENAMEX> deep into the bull‚Äôs aorta for the kill. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Success</ENAMEX> means instant death. But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX>, a tiny fist-sized area between the shoulders, can only be reached when the animal‚Äôs feet are together; and swift kills, which need strength as well as skill and nerve, don‚Äôt always happen.
If the fight has been good and the kill clean, the presidente will award the torero one or both of the bull‚Äôs ears and, for exceptional performances, the tail, too. An ear is usually the signal for a lap of honour, and, if the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX> agrees with the award, <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> and botas of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine shower</ENAMEX> into the ring. Very occasionally an exceptional performance by the bull earns him a reprieve for breeding. In this case, the presidente drops a green handkerchief and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX> goes wild.
The corrida is not for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">everyone¬†‚Äî¬†not</ENAMEX> even for every <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Spaniard</ENAMEX>. But see <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> before you pass judgement on this extraordinary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Folk Dance</ENAMEX>
The best known traditional dances on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Costa Blanca</ENAMEX> are the jota valenciana and jota murciana. Sets of vivacious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">performers</ENAMEX> either dance alone facing a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> or in pairs. Their steps can be vigorous or stately and gracious.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dancers</ENAMEX> are accompanied by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">musicians</ENAMEX> playing the guitar or instruments introduced into the region by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Moors¬†‚Äî¬†the</ENAMEX> dulzaina (flute) and tamboril (tambourine). The rhythms go all the way back to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iberians</ENAMEX> and reflect a diversity of influences, from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moorish</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aragonese</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Castilian</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cuban</ENAMEX>.
Both old and young take part, attesting to the growing revival of interest in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain‚</ENAMEX>Äôs rich heritage of traditional dance and music.
Flamenco
Guitars, the rhythm of castanets and drumming heels, and taut, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">anguished songs¬†‚Äî¬†that‚Äôs flamenco</ENAMEX>. You‚Äôll be left breathless by these songs and dances from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Andalusia</ENAMEX>.
There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> distinct forms of flamenco: the cante jondo (deep song) is an outpouring of intense, soul-searching emotions. The agonized songs, heavy with the wail of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arabia</ENAMEX>, come from deep within the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">singer</ENAMEX>, while the dances are formal and sombre. Cante jondo is seldom heard outside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Andalusia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX>, except on recordings.
Not so the cante chico (light song), a more animated version performed in tablaos (floor shows) on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Costa Blanca</ENAMEX>. With a little luck, you may even see flamenco performed by a top <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> dance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> touring on behalf of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ministry of Information and Tourism‚Äôs Festivales de Espa√±a</ENAMEX>. Although the songs may express something of the cante jondo‚Äôs desolation, the dancing is very different. The fandango, tango, farruca, and zambra are performed to the staccato rhythm of palmadas (hand-clapping), pitos (finger-snapping), the zapateado of fiercely drumming heels, and the fiery compulsion of the castanets.
In the tablaos and on the stage, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, their hair swept severely back, swirl in flounced and flowing tight-waisted dresses. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> perform in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cordoban suit¬†‚Äî¬†slightly</ENAMEX> flared, high-waisted trousers, frilled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shirt</ENAMEX>, and short jacket. These traditional costumes, and the fervent pride of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">performers</ENAMEX> who wear them, make for a colourful spectacle without equal on the cabaret stage.
Festivals
There are so many religious and folk celebrations on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Costa Blanca</ENAMEX> that you are bound to see one whenever you go. The list following is a selection of major events only. Where dates are movable, check with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Tourist Office</ENAMEX> in your <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> or, better still, with the local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sports</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Recreation</ENAMEX>
Beaches and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Swimming</ENAMEX>
Much of your <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Costa Blanca</ENAMEX> holiday will be spent on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">beaches¬†‚Äî¬†and</ENAMEX> there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of them. Some slope gently and are thronged with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>; others are tucked away in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">coves</ENAMEX> beneath spectacular cliffs, assuring all the privacy and tranquillity of a desert <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX>. (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beaches</ENAMEX>, page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">104</NUMEX>.)
Like <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX> elsewhere in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX>, those on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Costa Blanca</ENAMEX> have no <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lifeguards</ENAMEX>. There are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Red Cross</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> on the most popular beaches, but other than that, you‚Äôre on your own. Flags are used at all beaches to advise <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">swimmers</ENAMEX> of sea conditions: a green flag means the sea is safe for swimming, while a red flag warns of danger. Normal precautions apply here as elsewhere: beware especially of water-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">skiers</ENAMEX> and speed-<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX>, which sometimes stray from their flagged areas.
Most of the beaches with fine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sand</ENAMEX> are to the north of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alicante</ENAMEX>. In general, these have been developed as resorts and offer all sorts of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">facilities¬†‚Äî¬†everything</ENAMEX> from speedboats and parachutes to deck chairs and sunshades. The farther south you go, the fewer provisions you‚Äôll find for water-related activities. The beaches towards the south can be pebbly, while the sand is usually coarse. But the area beyond <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cartagena</ENAMEX> remains largely uncrowded; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are rare on this stretch of coast, so if you‚Äôre not looking for companionship this is the place to enjoy a solitude disturbed only by the crash of waves on the shore.
Away from the beach, there‚Äôs swimming at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Benidorm‚Äôs Aqualand</ENAMEX>, a water fun <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Snorkelling</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scuba Diving</ENAMEX>
For a new perspective on the wonders of the deep, all you need is a mask and breathing tube; the fins are optional. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Snorkelling</ENAMEX> is at its best off cliffs and near rocks. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Offshore</ENAMEX>, snorkellers are required, for safety reasons, to tow a marker buoy.
For more profound sea experiences, try scuba diving. Several centres provide all equipment, a dive <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX> local knowledge, and sometimes tuition as well. A diving permit is required under <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> law. Unless you speak reasonable <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> and know where to go, let your chosen diving centre deal with the documentation.
Diving is virtually always safe: The rips, currents, tides, and giant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">predators</ENAMEX> of other seas scarcely exist. All cliffs and islands, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Benidorm‚</ENAMEX>Äôs small reef, offer interesting diving. Local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> will show you where to find air-locked caves, probe modern wrecks full of surprises, or watch a fresh-water spring bubble <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mistily</ENAMEX> from the seabed. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX> around <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Calpe‚Äôs Pe√±√≥n</ENAMEX> have a tremendous variety of sea life such as the big-mouthed grouper, the rare zebra-striped bream, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wrasse</ENAMEX>. Any archaeological finds (and they are rare) must be handed in to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Comandancia de Marina</ENAMEX>.
Boating
Most beaches offer <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> for hire, but the only <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX> with a variety of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">craft</ENAMEX> to choose from are on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mar Menor</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Benidorm</ENAMEX> is usually the most expensive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX>.
You can take a pedal <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX>, a stable two-seater propelled by a bicycle-like waterwheel. (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Young children</ENAMEX> should be accompanied.) Gondolas, open, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">banana</ENAMEX>-shaped <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> powered by a double-ended paddle, are not suitable for small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>. Although many of the larger beaches have a few assorted sailing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> for hire, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Manga</ENAMEX> is the place for the keen sailor.
Wind-Surfing
Wind-surfing is the coast‚Äôs fastest-growing sport, but it‚Äôs also one of the most difficult. With agility and practice, however, and the help of an ocean breeze, you‚Äôll soon feel you‚Äôre flying.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Water-Skiing</ENAMEX>
Rising fuel costs mean that water-skiing is becoming an expensive sport; all the more reason to double-check rival <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> for length of runs, number of attempts allowed for ‚Äúgetting up,‚Äù and discounts for multiple runs. Serious lessons are usually confined to the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early morning</TIMEX>, when the sea is calmest. For something less energetic, try powerboat parachuting (parasailing). You needn‚Äôt even get your feet wet, and the view is superb.
Fishing
The rivers of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Costa Blanca</ENAMEX> region may reveal carp and barbel, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">don‚Äôt</ENAMEX> expect much excitement. The best freshwater fishing hereabouts is the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Amadorio Dam</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">21‚ÅÑ2 miles</NUMEX>) from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Villajoyosa</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</NUMEX>) and, to a lesser extent, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Guadalest‚Äôs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dam</ENAMEX>. They hold barbel, the biggest carp, smallish black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bass</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rainbow trout¬†‚Äî¬†introduced</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1977</TIMEX> and still protected. To catch them you‚Äôll need a licence with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">trout supplement</ENAMEX>. The season for non-mountain <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">trout</ENAMEX> runs from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first Sunday</TIMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March to 15 August</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries</ENAMEX> oversees licences.
If you go sea fishing, you will need local knowledge to hook big <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">grey mullet</ENAMEX>, sea bream, bass, and maybe even grouper below quiet cliffs, and mackerel <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two or three</NUMEX> miles out. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX>, you may catch the tasty dorada; in late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">autumn</TIMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX>, various species of tuna and swordfish.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tennis</ENAMEX>
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel court</ENAMEX> will probably be your best chance for a game of <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">tennis</ENAMEX>, but it may not be possible to hire balls and racquets. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Manga</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 30</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX>, many of them at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hotels</ENAMEX>. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golf</ENAMEX>
All golf <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Costa Blanca</ENAMEX> are open to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clubs</ENAMEX>, caddies, and occasionally, electric <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trolleys</ENAMEX> can be hired. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> 18-hole <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kentucky</ENAMEX> blue-grass <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX> near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">La Manga</ENAMEX> are the region‚Äôs lushest, with shady <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">palms</ENAMEX>. There is also a fine <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">18-hole</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">course</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Torrevieja‚Äôs Club Villa Mart√≠n</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> good <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>-hole <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX>: Altea-la-Vieja‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Don Cayo</ENAMEX>, where the hills test legs as well as golfing skills, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">San Jaime Club de Ifach</ENAMEX> between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calpe</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moraira</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Club de Golf</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">J√°vea.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Horseback Riding</ENAMEX>
For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX>, horseback riding has been a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> speciality. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ranch</ENAMEX>, catering to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> trade, provides a quiet seaside jog. The other offers good <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX>, skilled instruction, and interesting cross-country riding. For the experienced and saddle-fit, there are also mountain treks of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">up to five days</TIMEX>, for instance via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Altea‚Äôs R√≠o Algar</ENAMEX>, or from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">La Sella</ENAMEX>, near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">La Jara</ENAMEX>. These treks go through orange, almond, and olive <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">groves</ENAMEX>, past gaunt carob <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>, across rivers, and up through pine forests and open moors to real <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sierra</ENAMEX> country. 
Alternatively, it is possible for inexperienced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">riders</ENAMEX> to join other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> on horseback for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">moonlight excursion</ENAMEX>, with a barbecue at the end of an easy ride: it‚Äôs an excellent way to meet <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bird</ENAMEX>-Watching
Ornithologists, bring your binoculars. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Costa Blanca</ENAMEX> is crossed by principal migration routes and holds considerable, often unsuspected, bird life. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX>, if you sit by any reasonably quiet estuary, you may see black tern.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">autumn</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bird</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">watchers</ENAMEX> search cliffs, particularly <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Calpe‚Äôs Pe√±√≥n</ENAMEX>, for the rare <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Audouin‚Äôs Gull</ENAMEX>: look out for a small, sleek <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúherring gull‚Äù</ENAMEX> with dark olive legs and a heavyish red bill banded in black.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salinas de la Mata</ENAMEX>, just south of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guardamar</ENAMEX>, often (but not always) attracts <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of migratory flamingos, a few of which sometimes stay to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">breed</ENAMEX>.
Hunting and Shooting
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> has always been famously rich in hunting and shooting possibilities, from wolf to wild <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">boar¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†though the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Costa Blanca</ENAMEX> is hardly the place for it. Tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> have a brochure, ‚ÄúCaza,‚Äù which gives more information about where to go for good hunting and how to obtain the necessary permits.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shopping</ENAMEX>
You will often find the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Costa Blanca‚</ENAMEX>Äôs best buys off the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> or in the markets. For the greatest variety and lowest overall prices, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop</ENAMEX> in the side <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alicante</ENAMEX>. For special items, go inland to the place of manufacture, keeping in mind the prices asked on the coast and at home: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guadalest</ENAMEX> for ponchos and shawls; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gata</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cane</ENAMEX>, basket work, and guitars; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crevillente</ENAMEX> for woven rugs and carpets; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jijona</ENAMEX> for turr√≥n; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ibi</ENAMEX> for toys.
In general, look for good prices at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hypermarkets</ENAMEX> outside the major <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX>.
Save your bargaining for the gypsies and antique <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX>, but remember that they have been at it a long time. Beware of rebajas (sales); they may be genuine, but reductions are generally few and far between, especially in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> government levies a value-added tax (called IVA) on most items. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Tourists</ENAMEX> from overseas can get a refund on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IVA</ENAMEX> they‚Äôve paid on purchases over a stipulated amount. Major tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> have forms and details. The refund eventually arrives at your home address.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Summer shopping hours</TIMEX> are generally from <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. and from 5:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m.</TIMEX> (During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the rest of the year</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> open <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later</TIMEX> and close <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX>.) The big <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alicante</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Valencia</ENAMEX> department <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> stay open during the traditional siesta, which is the quietest time to shop. In the tourist season, small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> often stay open on a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bakeries</ENAMEX> and newsagents open <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">mornings only</TIMEX> on most <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiestas¬†‚Äî¬†but don‚</ENAMEX>Äôt count on it.
Best Buys
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Antiques</ENAMEX> can be good buys, but beware of fakes. Look for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">copper</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brass</ENAMEX>, hand-painted <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">tiles¬†‚Äî¬†usually</ENAMEX> rescued from old <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">houses¬†‚Äî¬†and</ENAMEX> simple <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> lamps. If you can find one, and carry it home, buy a traditional cradle. Few are authentically antique, but they are decorative and excellent for holding all sorts of things¬†‚Äî¬†even <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">babies</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cuban</ENAMEX> cigars are exceptional value for money (but <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> are not allowed to bring them <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Canary Island</ENAMEX> cigars and locally-made cigarettes are even cheaper.
Leather goods are no longer a bargain in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>, though very good quality products may still be priced lower than at home.
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Lladr√≥</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">porcelain</ENAMEX> has long been a collector‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">item</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lladr√≥</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brothers</ENAMEX> opened their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factory</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tabernes Blanques</ENAMEX>, near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Valencia</ENAMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1958</TIMEX>. Opposite is a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">seconds</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop</ENAMEX> with greatly reduced prices. Less detailed <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> are sold under the name <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Nao</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mat</ENAMEX> and basket-work has been a local <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">craft</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1,500 years</TIMEX> and is not very expensive.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ponchos</ENAMEX> and knitted shawls from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guadalest</ENAMEX> are colourful and attractive.
Rugs woven in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Crevillente</ENAMEX> are long-wearing and can be made to your own design.
Souvenirs are tempting purchases: pottery of all shapes, sizes, uses, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">prices¬†‚Äî¬†some</ENAMEX> featuring <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moorish</ENAMEX> designs; bullfight and flamenco posters with your name topping the bill; low-crowned, broad-brimmed Cordoban leather hats; hand-painted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fans</ENAMEX>; elegant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mantillas</ENAMEX> (the traditional lace shawls for special occasions); and botas, soft <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">leather wine</ENAMEX> bottles. (Avoid those with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plastic linings</ENAMEX>.)
Eating Out
Far more interesting than the so-called international cuisine, the hearty local dishes are worth seeking out: <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ingredients</ENAMEX> come fresh from the sea or the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">farm</ENAMEX> and are served with a wide choice of the region‚Äôs excellent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetables</ENAMEX>. Most tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> specialize in caution, with menus guaranteed to cause neither rapture nor complaints. Ask around and find out where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spaniards</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">resident expatriates</ENAMEX> eat.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Soups</ENAMEX> and Stews
The favourite <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dish</ENAMEX> of many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Andalusian ‚Äúliquid salad</ENAMEX>,‚Äù gazpacho. This chilled, highly-flavoured <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">soup</ENAMEX>, with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chopped tomatoes</ENAMEX>, peppers, cucumbers, onions, and croutons, is a rousing refresher on a hot <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer day</TIMEX>. Caution: gazpachos with an s is quite a different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dish</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">90</NUMEX>).
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michirones</ENAMEX> is a splendid mixture of broad <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beans</ENAMEX>, chunks of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ham</ENAMEX>, paprika, sausage, and hot peppers, plus tasty bits of this and that. Pebereta talladeta started life as a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stew</ENAMEX> composed of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">potatoes</ENAMEX>, pepper, and tunny <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">gills</ENAMEX>, but <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, thick tunny <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steaks</ENAMEX> are often the main <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ingredient</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guisado de pavo</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">turkey stew</ENAMEX>, is a gastronomic must: to do justice to this speciality of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Orihuela</ENAMEX>, be sure to order it <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">at least six hours</TIMEX> in advance.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rice</ENAMEX> and Paella
Excellent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX> (arroz) has grown on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Costa Blanca‚Äôs</ENAMEX> doorstep since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Moorish times</TIMEX>; hence the many <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX> dishes and, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX> of them all, world-famous paella. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paella</ENAMEX> is named after the large, shallow iron pan in which it is cooked and served. The basis is <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX>, soaked in stock coloured yellow with locally grown saffron, and fried. Paella valenciana adds <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meat</ENAMEX>, usually crisply fried <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chicken</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pork</ENAMEX>, and a seasonal variety of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peas</ENAMEX>, green <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beans</ENAMEX>, peppers, and other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetables</ENAMEX>. Paella alicantina is the same, plus generous portions of whole prawns, mussels, small whole <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">crabs, octopus</ENAMEX>, and slices of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lemon</ENAMEX>. A good one is a gastronomic thrill!
Spaniards only eat paella at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">midday¬†‚Äî¬†often</ENAMEX>, unbelievably, as part of a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-course meal. But, if you want <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midnight</TIMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX> will most likely oblige. A good paella is always made to order and takes <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 30 minutes</TIMEX> to prepare.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Fish</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seafood</ENAMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seafood</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX> provide some of the coast‚Äôs most memorable meals. A great favourite is zarzuela de mariscos, a variation of a Catalan <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dish</ENAMEX>, which combines many different ingredients, just like the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> operetta from which it takes its name. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shellfish</ENAMEX> is served with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX> in an unlikely but very tasty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sauce</ENAMEX> of olive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX>, ground almonds, assorted <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spices</ENAMEX>, and chocolate, though local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cooks</ENAMEX> sometimes cheat a bit by adding octopus and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">shell</ENAMEX>-less tidbits.
Then there is <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">langosta¬†‚Äî¬†spiny lobster¬†‚Äî¬†as succulent</ENAMEX> and as expensive as ever, and sometimes priced per <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> grammes (be sure to read the menu‚Äôs small print to make sure). Gambas are prawns, and langostinos the jumbo-sized version. Try them a la <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">plancha</ENAMEX> (grilled), a la <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">romana</ENAMEX> (fried in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">batter</ENAMEX>), or <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">al</ENAMEX> pil pil in a hot <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spicy sauce</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Emperador</ENAMEX> (swordfish) is especially good grilled, and lenguado (sole) is delicious in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">batter</ENAMEX>, grilled, or saut√©ed in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">butter</ENAMEX>. For something different, try <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dorada a la sal</ENAMEX>: a whole <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> is packed in wet <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX>, then baked. It comes to the table in a shiny white jacket that is broken when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> is cut and served.
These seafood dishes tend to be rather expensive, but there are some cheaper options. Try calamares (squid), for instance; they are marvellous deep-fried (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">a la romana</ENAMEX>), stuffed (rellenos), or cooked in their own ink (en su tinta). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mejillones</ENAMEX> (mussels) can be remarkably good steamed with a dash of white <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> and garlic. Caballa, the rich-fleshed mackerel, is sometimes available ahumada (smoked). 
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Meat</ENAMEX> Dishes
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rice</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> dishes make up a substantial part of the local diet. However, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meat</ENAMEX> is used in regional cooking, though in nothing like the same range and imaginative presentation.
Among local meat specialities is gazpachos (with a final s to distinguish it from the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chilled soup</ENAMEX>). This lusty, well-spiced <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Costa Blanca</ENAMEX> dish consists of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pork</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chicken</ENAMEX>, rabbit, and snails¬†‚Äî¬†and perhaps even a partridge or pigeon. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">It‚Äôs</ENAMEX> stewed in a large frying pan and traditionally eaten on a kind of pancake. Criadillas are considered a delicacy: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> tourist-conscious menu bills them as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äúmountain oysters</ENAMEX>,‚Äù but they are in fact bulls‚Äô testicles. When it‚Äôs time for a splurge, try cabrito asado (roast <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX>) or cochinillo (roast <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">suckling pig</ENAMEX>). Both treats are expensive but delicious.
Alioli, a whipped <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sauce</ENAMEX> of fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">garlic</ENAMEX> and olive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX>, accompanies many dishes. It‚Äôs a piquant speciality of the region, and an excellent <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Dessert</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fruit</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Ice cream</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cheese</ENAMEX>, or flan (cr√®me caramel) are the most popular desserts. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX> and early <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">autumn</TIMEX> you will be spoiled with an enormous array of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX>. The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekly</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">markets¬</ENAMEX>†‚Äî¬†the best place to buy¬†‚Äî¬†are full of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">strawberries</ENAMEX>, n√≠speros (a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cousin</ENAMEX> of the lychee), <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">grapes</ENAMEX>, figs, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">melons</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peaches</ENAMEX>, apricots, raspberries, pomegranates, grapefruit, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lemons</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oranges</ENAMEX>, tangerines, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">apples</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">pears</ENAMEX>, and even locally grown <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bananas</ENAMEX>, pineapples, and dates.
Tapas
A tapa is a mouthful of anything that tastes good and fits on a cocktail stick. The variety is enormous: smoked mountain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ham</ENAMEX>, spicy sausages, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cheese</ENAMEX>, olives (some as big as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pigeon‚Äôs eggs</ENAMEX>), sardines, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mushrooms</ENAMEX>, mussels, squid, octopus, meatballs, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fried fish</ENAMEX>, plus <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sauces</ENAMEX> and exotic-looking specialities of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>. The name comes from the practice, sadly almost vanished, of providing a free bite with every drink. The tidbit was put on a small plate traditionally used to cover the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glass</ENAMEX> and came to be called a tapa, which means lid.
Touring tapas <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX> is great fun, especially in a town‚Äôs old <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">quarter</TIMEX>. It can be expensive, certainly more than the cost of an orthodox <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meal</ENAMEX>, but do try to devote <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">at least an evening</TIMEX> to it. The code is simple: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> helping is called a porci√≥n; a large serving is a raci√≥n; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> as much, a media-raci√≥n.
Breakfast
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spaniards</ENAMEX> start <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bread</ENAMEX>, a simple roll, or the traditional churro, a kind of elongated fritter made by pouring a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">batter</ENAMEX>-like mixture into a cauldron of hot olive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX>. The golden-brown result is dusted with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sugar</ENAMEX>, sometimes coated with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chocolate sauce</ENAMEX>, or both.
In deference to foreign habits, full breakfast (desayuno completo) is served at most tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX>. This usually consists of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit juice</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX>, rolls, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX>, and perhaps <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacon</ENAMEX> as well. Although <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oranges</ENAMEX> grow all around you, freshly squeezed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">juice</ENAMEX> is hard to find. Try anyway. Ask for zumo natural de naranja (freshly pressed orange juice).
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mermelada</ENAMEX> means any form of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">jam</ENAMEX>. Marmalade <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lovers</ENAMEX> should ask for mermelada de naranja. If you prefer bitter orange, be sure to specify naranja amarga.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Restaurants</ENAMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> eat late, but in tourist areas you will be served <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">lunch from 1:00 p.m. and dinner from 8:00 p.m.</TIMEX> Bills tend to include tax and service charge, but it is usual to leave a small tip: <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 5 percent</NUMEX> is generous.
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> are classified and priced by a system of forks, with <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> and length of menu more relevant than the quality of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Five</NUMEX> forks guarantee real comfort, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> will not necessarily be better than in a two-or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-fork establishment, just more expensive. A bargain men√∫ <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">del</ENAMEX> dia (menu of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX>) is often proposed. There are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> specializing in them, offering <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> good <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bread</ENAMEX>, and a jug of very reasonable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vino</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de la</ENAMEX> casa (house <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX>).
If you are saving up for a special <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">meal</TIMEX>, or just economizing, fill up on traditional potajes, thick soups full of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetables</ENAMEX>, in unpretentious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> with one fork or none. Spain‚Äôs golden potato <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">omelette</ENAMEX> (tortilla espa√±ola) makes another excellent budget <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meal</ENAMEX>. To keep costs down, order vino <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de la</ENAMEX> casa (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>).
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bars</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caf√</ENAMEX>©s
Banish the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX> and caf√©s and you‚Äôd disconcert the whole of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>. These <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">establishments</ENAMEX> are at the centre of the country‚Äôs social life: where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> take an <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early morning</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drink</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">businessmen</ENAMEX> negotiate; where old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> play cards and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> meet to watch the world go by from shaded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pavement</ENAMEX> tables. Traditionally, a drink buys a seat for as long as you want to stay. In areas popular with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX>, though, you might find the waiter hovering.
Bars are graded from <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> class and charge accordingly; prices always include service, but a small <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 percent</NUMEX> tip is usual. You will pay <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">up to 15 percent</NUMEX> more for service at a table, especially in tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centres</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Wines</ENAMEX> and Spirits
Although <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wines</ENAMEX> from the north are considered to be <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spain‚</ENAMEX>Äôs best, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Costa Blanca‚</ENAMEX>Äôs vino is very drinkable and very reasonably priced. Look for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mon√≥var, Pinosa</ENAMEX>, and the lighter, less plentiful <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ricote</ENAMEX> (all available in red, ros√©, or white). Beware of the innocent-looking red <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Jumilla</ENAMEX>. Its <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">18 percent</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> content can sneak up on you. Same peril with the strong <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Alicante dessert wine</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten</TIMEX> drops of which were long reckoned to be one of nature‚Äôs surest cures. Although the prescribed amount failed to restore France‚Äôs ageing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Louis XIV</ENAMEX> to health, it might work wonders with a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX>-after feeling. Be sure to taste the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Costa Blanca‚</ENAMEX>Äôs famous Moscatel <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX>. It‚Äôs perfect with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dessert</ENAMEX> and preserves all the sweet, distinctive flavour of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Muscat</ENAMEX> grape.
Try to visit a bodega, one of the large wine cellars to be found in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> and most <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX>. Wine matured in the enormous, dark barrels that line the walls of the older <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bodegas</ENAMEX> is not much more expensive than vino corriente (ordinary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX>) from a modern, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">million</NUMEX>-litre vat. Sample before buying, especially the cheaper <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wines</ENAMEX>. They cost less than some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mineral waters</ENAMEX> and will be blended to your taste; containers are extra. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sherry</ENAMEX> (jerez), a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> fortified with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">brandy</ENAMEX>, has been made in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 18th century</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> was already exporting it to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">It‚Äôs</ENAMEX> hardly surprising, then, that only <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sherry</ENAMEX> can carry the name unlinked with a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> of origin. You will find all the world-famous names on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Costa Blanca</ENAMEX>, all at reasonable prices. If you are baffled by the choice, remember the main <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">types</ENAMEX> and experiment.
Finos are dry and pale, with a rich bouquet. They are usually taken as aperitifs, particularly manzanillas, the driest of all, and amontillados. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Olorosos</ENAMEX> (which include the brown and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cream</ENAMEX> varieties) are sweet, heavy, and dark, and go well with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dessert</ENAMEX>. Somewhere between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> are the amorosos. These are medium dry, light <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">amber</ENAMEX> in colour, and can be ordered for an aperitif or as a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dessert wine</ENAMEX>. Most can be bought from the barrel, blended to your own taste.
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Spanish champagne</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cava</ENAMEX>) is mass-produced and reasonably priced but almost always sweet. For a dry <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drink</ENAMEX>, look for the description brut. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seco</ENAMEX> (dry) never really is, and dulce is very sweet.
There are other sparkling <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wines</ENAMEX>, vinos espumosos, which, slightly chilled, go down well on a hot day. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Spanish brandy</ENAMEX> is a bit heavy and sweet and bears little resemblance to the best <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> cognacs, but it is a good, reasonably priced drink. The more expensive varieties are smoother.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Liqueurs</ENAMEX> abound. Many famous foreign brands (especially <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>) are made under licence and sell at prices way below those in their home <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>. A glance along the shelves of any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX> shows the vast range of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">liqueurs</ENAMEX>. They are mostly sweet and often herbal. Try <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alicante‚Äôs Cantueso</ENAMEX>, made since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1867</TIMEX> and still unknown outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX>.
You‚Äôll enjoy sangr√≠a, an iced, hot-weather drink that combines red <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">brandy</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mineral water</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit juice</ENAMEX>, sliced <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oranges</ENAMEX>, and other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sugar</ENAMEX>. Beware: it can pack a punch, especially when laced with rough <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">brandy</ENAMEX>, but you can always dilute sangr√≠a with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">soda water</ENAMEX> and plenty of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX>.
Other Drinks
Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourist caf√</ENAMEX>©s advertise ‚Äútea like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> makes,‚Äù but in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">native Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">establishments</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> is unlikely to evoke dreams of home. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Coffee</ENAMEX> is very good. Learn the coffee code: <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">caf√© con leche</ENAMEX>, similar to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> coffee, is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> coffee, half <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk</ENAMEX>; caf√© cortado is strong and served with a dash of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cream</ENAMEX> (or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk</ENAMEX>); caf√© solo is strong and black. Milder instant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffees</ENAMEX> are often available. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Coffee</ENAMEX> without caffeine is descafeinado.
