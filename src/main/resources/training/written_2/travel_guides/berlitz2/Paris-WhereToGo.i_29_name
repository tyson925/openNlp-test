Where To Go
Getting Around
The first thing you should get is a carnet, or book of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> m√©tro tickets (good for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">buses</ENAMEX>, too). Or, better still, if you‚Äôre staying <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a week</TIMEX> or more, one of the special passes which give even greater savings (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">118</NUMEX>). Then, buy a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum Pass</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">74</NUMEX>) to save money and avoid waiting at ticket counters.
To get your bearings, picture <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> as a circle, with the river <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Seine</ENAMEX> threading across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>, flanked by famous landmarks¬†‚Äî¬†Notre-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dame</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Louvre</ENAMEX>, place <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de la Concorde</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Arc de Triomphe</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Tour Eiffel</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bridges</ENAMEX> link the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Right</ENAMEX> (north) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Left Banks</ENAMEX> via the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> islands in the middle, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ile de la Cit√©</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ile St-Louis</ENAMEX>.
This is one of the easiest of large <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> to travel around. The modernized <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">m√©tro system</ENAMEX> is smooth, regular, and fast, with low, flat-rate fares. RER commuter <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trains</ENAMEX> can also take you rapidly to the outskirts, where <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> major attractions, <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Versailles</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Disneyland Paris Resort</ENAMEX>, are located.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">Buses</ENAMEX> give you a sightseeing tour at a bargain price, respecting schedules as far as traffic allows (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">rush hours</TIMEX> can create terrible jams). Taxis provide a lazy alternative, but are not always faster than the m√©tro, especially on longer rides across <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>.
Bus tours take you to the big attractions, but inevitably at times when they are busiest. Some tour <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">buses</ENAMEX> that take you around the highlights let you hop on and off, wherever and as often as you like, all on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> ticket, for a period of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">up to 48 hours</TIMEX>. Tourist information <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">121</NUMEX>) have details. Bicycle rental <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">103</NUMEX>) also run tours. If you want to sightsee in style (and expensively) you can even see <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> from a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">helicopter</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX>, or hot-air balloon. In-line skates have become very popular for touring the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> and can also be rented (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">103</NUMEX>).
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parisians</ENAMEX> themselves often use the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Batobus</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">river bus</ENAMEX>) for traveling east or west and avoiding traffic snarls. It runs from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September</TIMEX>; stops are at the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Tour Eiffel</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mus√</ENAMEX>©e d‚ÄôOrsay, <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Louvre</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Notre-Dame</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H√¥tel de Ville</ENAMEX>. It‚Äôs relatively expensive, but you may prefer the absence of commentary.
A boat cruise on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seine</ENAMEX> is one of the best introductions to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. While you glide along, multilingual commentaries tell you about the sights. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">Boats</ENAMEX> run from <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 10am to 10:30pm</TIMEX>. Most tour <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> provide a choice of open-air and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">glassed</ENAMEX>-in seating; some offer lunch and dinner. Trips <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">last 60 to 75 minutes</TIMEX>. Canal tours reveal a less grand but more intimate face of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> on the way from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Parc de la Villette</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">72</NUMEX>) in the northeastern outskirts. The leisurely trip takes <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three hours</TIMEX>, with a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tunnel</ENAMEX> and several locks to be negotiated.
Central <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> is surprisingly compact, and most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> are close to many of the sights. So if time isn‚Äôt a major factor, the best way of getting the feel of the place is to walk. All you need is a pair of comfortable shoes and a map. The big department <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> give away <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of street maps <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each year</TIMEX>. M√©tro <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stations</ENAMEX> display good maps of their local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">district</ENAMEX> as well as the m√©tro itself, and give out pocket plans of the m√©tro and bus routes. At street level, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bus</ENAMEX>-stop shelters have an excellent detailed map of the neighborhood. More and more <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> and entire <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">areas</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Les Halles</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beaubourg</ENAMEX> have been pedestrianized, adding to the profusion of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX>, squares, and gardens.
The Islands
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ile de la Cit√</ENAMEX>©
This is where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paris‚Äôs</ENAMEX> story began. Like the emblem on its coat of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ile de la Cit√©</ENAMEX> takes the form of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX>, with the romantic tree-shaded place du <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vert Galant</ENAMEX> as its prow pointing downstream. From the first settlement built by the original <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parisii</ENAMEX> until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the middle of the 19th century</TIMEX>, the pocket-sized island lay at the heart of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. The earliest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rulers</ENAMEX> held <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> here. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cathedral clergy</ENAMEX> and artisans made it their home. Then, ruthless urban <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planner Baron</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Haussmann</ENAMEX> swept away almost all the medieval and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX>, leaving just place <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dauphine</ENAMEX> and rue <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chanoinesse</ENAMEX> (ancient home of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cathedral canons</ENAMEX>) as signs of the island‚Äôs once rich residential life.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baron</ENAMEX> was also toying with the idea of replacing the gracious red brick <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> of the triangular place <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dauphine</ENAMEX> with a neo-Grecian colonnaded <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> when, thankfully, he was forced out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> for juggling the books. Near the lively <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pont</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Neuf</ENAMEX>, the place was built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1607</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henri IV</ENAMEX> in honor of his son the dauphin (or future <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Louis XIII</ENAMEX>). Sadly, only numbers <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14 and 26</TIMEX> are still in their original <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. Number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> was the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">home</ENAMEX> of film <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stars</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simone Signoret</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yves Montand</ENAMEX>.
The huge <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palais de Justice</ENAMEX>, heart of the centralized <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> legal system, stands on the site of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> where the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Emperor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Julian</ENAMEX> was crowned in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">360</TIMEX>. Together with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conciergerie</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>), it sprawls right across the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ile de la Cit√©.</ENAMEX> Concealed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX> between them is a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Gothic masterpiece</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Sainte-Chapelle</ENAMEX>, whose fine proportions stand in sharp contrast to the ponderous palace. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">chapel</ENAMEX> was constructed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1248</TIMEX> to house holy relics, fragments of what were believed to be <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jesus‚Äôs Crown of Thorns</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">True Cross</ENAMEX>, which pious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Louis</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IX</NUMEX> (later canonized as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. Louis</ENAMEX>) had bought from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Byzantine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emperor</ENAMEX>. Try to arrive as the chapel opens or at sunset (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39</NUMEX>) and make your way to the upper level, where light blazes in through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> stained-glass windows separated by buttresses so slim that there seems to be no <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wall</ENAMEX> at all. Miraculously, of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,134</NUMEX> individual pieces of glass, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">720</NUMEX> are <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">originals</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">chapel</ENAMEX> provides an exquisite setting for chamber music concerts.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Between 1789 and 1815</TIMEX> the chapel assumed various guises: a flour <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">warehouse</ENAMEX> during the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Revolution</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">club</ENAMEX> for high-ranking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dandies</ENAMEX>, then an archive for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Napol√©on‚Äôs Consulate</ENAMEX>. It was this latter role that saved the chapel from projected destruction, since the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bureaucrats</ENAMEX> could not think of another site in which to put their mountains of paper.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">These days</TIMEX>, they find room for their papers in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palais de Justice</ENAMEX> and the nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Pr√©fecture de Police</ENAMEX>, haunt of those fictional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">detectives</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Inspectors Maigret</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clouseau</ENAMEX>. The great <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lobby</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palais</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salle des Pas Perdus</ENAMEX>, is worth a visit for a glimpse of the many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">plaintiffs</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witnesses</ENAMEX>, court <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX>, and assorted hangers-on waiting nervously for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">wheels</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">justice</ENAMEX> to grind into action.
Their <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">anxiety</ENAMEX> is nothing compared with that of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prisoners</ENAMEX> once held in the forbidding <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Conciergerie</ENAMEX> (entrance on the quai de l‚ÄôHorloge). It was originally the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX> of the king‚Äôs concierge as part of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 14th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">royal palace</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1793</TIMEX>, at the height of the Terror, it literally became the ‚Äúantechamber of the guillotine.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù Queen Marie-Antoinette</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Robespierre, Danton</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint</ENAMEX>-Just all spent their last <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">nights</TIMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Galerie des Prisonniers</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salle des Girondins</ENAMEX> displays a guillotine blade, the crucifix to which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marie-Antoinette</ENAMEX> prayed, and the lock used on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Robespierre‚Äôs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>. Look out on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cour des Femmes</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husbands</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lovers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wives</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mistresses</ENAMEX> were allowed one final tryst before the tumbrels came to carry off the condemned. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">About 2,500</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Revolutionary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guillotine</ENAMEX> spent their <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">last hours</TIMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conciergerie</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Notre-Dame</ENAMEX>
The site of the cathedral of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Notre-Dame de Paris</ENAMEX> has had a religious role for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least 2,000 years</TIMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> times a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Jupiter</ENAMEX> stood here; some stone fragments unearthed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1711</TIMEX> can be seen in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mus√©e du Moyen Age</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55</NUMEX>). In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fourth century</TIMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">St-Etienne</ENAMEX>, was built, joined <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two centuries later</TIMEX> by a second <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>, dedicated to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Notre-Dame</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norman</ENAMEX> raids left both in a sorry <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bishop Maurice de Sully</ENAMEX> decided a cathedral should be built to replace them. Begun in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1163</TIMEX>, the main part of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Notre-Dame</ENAMEX> took <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">167 years</TIMEX> to finish. Its transition from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Romanesque</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gothic</ENAMEX> has been called a perfect representation of medieval architecture, an opinion that has ancient and modern <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dissenters</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cistercian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monks</ENAMEX> protested that such a sumptuous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> was an insult to the godly virtue of poverty, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, architectural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">purists</ENAMEX> still find <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Notre-Dame</ENAMEX> a bit ‚Äútoo much.‚Äù It was, however, built to inspire awe.
Over its long history, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">cathedral</ENAMEX> has witnessed many momentous occasions. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1239</TIMEX>, there was the procession of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Louis</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IX</NUMEX>, barefoot, carrying his holy treasure, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jesus‚Äôs Crown of Thorns</ENAMEX> (now in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Sainte-Chapelle</ENAMEX>); in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1430</TIMEX>, it saw the humiliation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Henry VI of England</ENAMEX> (he was crowned <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">King of France</ENAMEX> here; see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>). And in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1594</TIMEX>, it was where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henri IV</ENAMEX> made his cynical conversion to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Catholicism</ENAMEX>, a move that reinforced his hold on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> throne. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Napol√©on</ENAMEX> chose it as the setting for crowning himself <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emperor</ENAMEX> (upstaging the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pope</ENAMEX>, who had come to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> expecting to do it).
In modern times, it has been a place for celebrating victory and mourning the passing of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">France‚Äôs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Gaulle</ENAMEX> marked the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1944</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Liberation</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> with a mass here, and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1970</TIMEX> his death was similarly commemorated. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">funeral service</ENAMEX> was held for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Gaulle‚</ENAMEX>Äôs archrival <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fran√</ENAMEX>ßois <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitterrand</ENAMEX> here.
Across the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> doorways of the west front, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX> statues of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Galerie des Rois</ENAMEX> represent the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">kings</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judah</ENAMEX>. These are <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">restorations</ENAMEX>: The originals were torn down during the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Revolution</ENAMEX> because they were thought to depict <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">kings</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> of them were recently discovered and preserved in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mus√©e du Moyen Age</ENAMEX>, see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55</NUMEX>). The superb central rose window depicts the Redemption after the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Fall</ENAMEX>. Two more outsized rose windows illuminate the transept; the northern window retains most of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">its 13th-century</TIMEX> glass. A lovely <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virgin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Child</ENAMEX>, emblematic of the cathedral‚Äôs name, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Notre-Dame de Paris</ENAMEX> (Our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lady</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX>), is to the right of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">choir</ENAMEX> entrance.
The cathedral‚Äôs original <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX> is unknown, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierre de Montreuil</ENAMEX> (who was involved in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Sainte-Chapelle</ENAMEX>) was responsible for a large part of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 13th-century</TIMEX> work. The present state of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cathedral</ENAMEX> owes much to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Eug√®ne Viollet-le-Duc</ENAMEX>, who from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1845 to 1863</TIMEX> painstakingly restored it following the ravages of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 18th century</TIMEX>, caused more by pre-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Revolutionary</ENAMEX> meddlers than by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">revolutionaries</ENAMEX> who stripped it of religious symbols. Popular support for the costly restoration was inspired by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Victor Hugo‚Äôs</ENAMEX> novel, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Hunchback of Notre-Dame</ENAMEX>.
The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">255</NUMEX>-step climb up the north <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> is rewarded with wonderful views of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> and close-ups of the roof and gargoyles. Entrance is free <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first Sunday of the month</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cross</ENAMEX> over to the south tower¬†‚Äî¬†and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">another 122</NUMEX> steps¬<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">†‚Äî¬†to</ENAMEX> see the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">13-ton</NUMEX> bell, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> remaining (the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Revolutionaries</ENAMEX> melted down the others to make cannon). The bell was re-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cast</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1680s</TIMEX>. A further <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">124</NUMEX> steps lead to the top of the south <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> for other spectacular views.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Baron</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Haussmann</ENAMEX> greatly enlarged the parvis, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cathedral forecourt</ENAMEX>, diminishing the impact of the towering west front. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">crypt</ENAMEX> beneath the square contains walls and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">foundations</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gallic</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medieval eras</ENAMEX>, and a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">well</ENAMEX> designed exhibition on early <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ile St-Louis</ENAMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX> across to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ile St-Louis</ENAMEX> leads to a blessed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">sanctuary</ENAMEX> of gracious living, its quiet <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> lined by elegant <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansions</ENAMEX>, long popular with the city‚Äôs affluent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gentry</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pompidou</ENAMEX> had a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">quai</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de B√</ENAMEX>©thune and used to escape there from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Elys√©e Palace</ENAMEX> as frequently as he could.
At <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> quai d‚ÄôAnjou is the grand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H√¥tel Lauzun</ENAMEX>, built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1650s</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Le Vau</ENAMEX>, who worked on the riverfront fa√ßade of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Louvre and the Versailles ch√¢teau</ENAMEX>. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H√¥tel Lambert</ENAMEX>, on the corner of the rue <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">St-Louis</ENAMEX>-en-l‚ÄôIle, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Voltaire</ENAMEX> once enjoyed a tempestuous love affair with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marquise du Ch√¢telet.</ENAMEX> The airy, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">bright Baroque church of St</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Louis</ENAMEX>-en-l‚ÄôIle illuminates with a golden light its fine collection of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Flemish</ENAMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Italian 16th- and 17th-century</TIMEX> art.
From the western end of the shady quai <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">d‚ÄôOrl√©ans</ENAMEX>, you‚Äôll have a splendid view of the apse of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Notre-Dame</ENAMEX>. Other pilgrims to this spot are more intent on a visit to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berthillon</ENAMEX>, a hallowed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">maker</ENAMEX> of astonishing ice creams and sorbets.
Right <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bank</ENAMEX>
The sprawling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Right Bank</ENAMEX> (rive droite) covers the whole range of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paris‚</ENAMEX>Äôs social life, from ultra-chic to downright sleazy. It claims the most luxurious shopping areas, the presidential <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Elys√©e Palace</ENAMEX>, the grands boulevards and financial district, but also, farther north, seamy <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clichy</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pigalle</ENAMEX>, as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hilly</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Montmartre</ENAMEX>, where modern art could be said to have begun. Back in the middle of it all, the huge <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Louvre</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> makes its own magnificent statement. Just to the east, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Les Halles</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beaubourg</ENAMEX> (around the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Centre Georges-Pompidou</ENAMEX>), and place <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de la Bastille</ENAMEX> have each been transformed by controversial projects. The variety and energy of the nightlife here has overtaken that of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Left Bank</ENAMEX>. Even the charming old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marais</ENAMEX> and its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Jewish quarter</TIMEX>, representing the old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th century</TIMEX>, have taken on a new fashionable appearance with the influx of trendy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boutiques</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Place Charles-de-Gaulle</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">l‚ÄôEtoile</ENAMEX>)
Officially renamed place <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles de Gaulle</ENAMEX> after the death of the great <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1969</TIMEX>, it is still known to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Parisians</ENAMEX> as l‚ÄôEtoile (the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">star</ENAMEX>) for the twelve avenues branching out from the center like a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">star</ENAMEX>. The circular space with its whirling traffic is dominated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Arc de Triomphe, 50 m</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">164 ft</ENAMEX>) high and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">45 m</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">148 ft</ENAMEX>) wide. A trip to the top by elevator affords spectacular views. It is here that you can best appreciate the tour de force of geometric planning the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">avenues</ENAMEX> represent.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Arc de Triomphe</ENAMEX> was conceived by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Napol√</ENAMEX>©on I as a tribute to his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">armies</ENAMEX>, and bears the names of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of his marshals and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generals</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozens</NUMEX> of victories. No defeats are recorded, naturally, although a few of the victories are debatable. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Napol√©on</ENAMEX> himself only ever saw a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wood</ENAMEX> and canvas model: the arch was completed during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1830s</TIMEX>. It soon became the focus for state occasions, such as the return of the ex-emperor‚Äôs own remains from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Helena</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1840</TIMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">funeral</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Victor Hugo</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1885</TIMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1920</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Unknown Soldier of World War I</ENAMEX> was buried at the arch; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three years later</TIMEX> the eternal flame was lit. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adolf Hitler</ENAMEX> arrived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> as a conqueror in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1940</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Arc de Triomphe</ENAMEX> was the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> place he wanted to see. And at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Liberation</ENAMEX>, this was the spot where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">General</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Gaulle</ENAMEX> commenced his triumphal march down the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Champs-Elys√©es.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avenue Foch</ENAMEX>, leading away from l‚ÄôEtoile to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bois de Boulogne</ENAMEX>, is one of the most majestic of the city‚Äôs residential <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">avenues</ENAMEX>. It is one of the most exclusive, too, though somewhat democratized <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these days</TIMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of boules <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX> on its graveled side <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">paths</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avenue de la Grande-Arm√</ENAMEX>©e points straight to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Neuilly</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">towers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La D√</ENAMEX>©fense with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Grande Arche</ENAMEX> behind.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avenue des Champs-Elys√</ENAMEX>©es
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX> it was fashionable to look down on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Champs-Elys√©es</ENAMEX> (many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Parisians</ENAMEX> claimed they never set foot there), but it is returning to favor. Tastefully refurbished, it can once again claim to be one of the finest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">avenues</ENAMEX> in the world. Straight as a rod, it slopes down to the place <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de la Concorde</ENAMEX> through a lovely parade of chestnut <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>, the object of careful replanting to ensure that the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">avenue</ENAMEX> retains its elegant beauty.
The top <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two-thirds</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">avenue</ENAMEX> are filled with cinemas, airline <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>, and car <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">showrooms</ENAMEX>, the excellent tourist information <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> (number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">127</NUMEX>), and caf√© terraces that make perfect, if slightly expensive, vantage points for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>-watching.
Below the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rond</ENAMEX>-Point, the mood changes and a pleasant <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> leads you past <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> landmarks: the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Petit Palais</ENAMEX>, all steel and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glass</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Grand Palais</ENAMEX>. Both were constructed for the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Universal Exhibition of 1900</ENAMEX> and are <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> used for a variety of exhibitions, though the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Petit Palais</ENAMEX> houses <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several</NUMEX> permanent collections of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> paintings. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grand Palais</ENAMEX> shares its colossal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palais de la D√©couverte</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">75</NUMEX>), and includes among its displays a hands-on exhibition of the sciences, with a planetarium as <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centerpiece</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacques-Ange Gabriel</ENAMEX> designed the gigantic place <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de la Concorde</ENAMEX> as place <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Louis XV</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1753</TIMEX>, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Revolution</ENAMEX> dispensed with all royal connotations. A guillotine replaced the king‚Äôs statue and was used to behead <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Louis XVI</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 1,000</NUMEX> other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1934</TIMEX>, it was the scene of bloody anti-government rioting by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> fascists.
Topped by a newly gilded pyramidal tip, the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">23-m</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">75</NUMEX>-ft) pink granite <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Obelisk of Luxor</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Ramses II</ENAMEX> dates back to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1300</TIMEX> b.c. and was erected here in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1836</TIMEX>. For a change, it‚Äôs not something that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Napol√</ENAMEX>©on looted during a campaign, but was a gift from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mohammed Ali</ENAMEX>, viceroy of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> imposing horses guarding the entrance to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Champs-Elys√</ENAMEX>©es are replicas of the handsome <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chevaux de Marly</ENAMEX>, sculpted by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guillaume Coustou</ENAMEX>. (The marble <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">originals</ENAMEX> now grace the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cour Marly</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Louvre</ENAMEX>.)
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jardin des Tuileries</ENAMEX>
Take time off from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> bustle for a stroll through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jardin des Tuileries</ENAMEX>, named after a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13th-century</TIMEX> tile <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">works</ENAMEX> and now beautifully re-landscaped as part of a renovation plan for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Mus√©e du Louvre</ENAMEX> to the east. Walk around the chestnut and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">lime trees</ENAMEX>, and admire <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aristide Maillol‚</ENAMEX>Äôs 18 sensual statues of nymphs and languorous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">maidens</ENAMEX>, a few of which are coquettishly half concealed behind a miniature maze.
The gardens‚Äô <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">28 hectares</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">11 acres</NUMEX>) extend across the site of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">royal Palais des Tuileries</ENAMEX>, burnt down during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1871</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commune</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX>). A few fragments of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> can be seen by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jeu de Paume</ENAMEX> exhibition <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> in the northwest corner. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Children</ENAMEX> can enjoy donkey rides, puppet shows in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">spring</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model boats</ENAMEX> on the circular ponds. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Adults</ENAMEX> go for the giant <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">Ferris</ENAMEX> wheel installed at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the holiday season</TIMEX>.
In the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">corner</ENAMEX> near the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seine</ENAMEX>, facing place <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de la Concorde</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Orangerie</ENAMEX> is known for its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">oval rooms</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monet‚</ENAMEX>Äôs beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nymph√©as</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Water Lilies</ENAMEX>) murals, but see, too, the fine collection of Impressionist and post-Impressionist paintings upstairs (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">71</NUMEX>).
At the eastern entrance to the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Tuileries, the pink Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel</ENAMEX> was built at roughly the same time as its bigger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> at l‚ÄôEtoile. The latter is visible from here in a straight line beyond the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Obelisk</ENAMEX> on place <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de la Concorde</ENAMEX>. The same axis continues into the distant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">haze</ENAMEX> to the skyscrapers of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">La D√©fense and the Grande Arche</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palais du Louvre</ENAMEX>
This is truly one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">world‚Äôs treasure houses</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">67</NUMEX> for a description of its art collection). Despite its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eight centuries</TIMEX> in the making, it has preserved a wonderful harmony. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX> built as a fortress by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philippe Auguste</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1190</TIMEX>, it has been added to and altered by his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">successors</ENAMEX>. When <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Louis XIV</ENAMEX> moved his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Versailles</ENAMEX>, he abandoned the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Louvre</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX>, sculptors, and other squatters. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Revolutionaries</ENAMEX> made it a public <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1793</TIMEX>. As the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">home</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">V√©nus de Milo</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mona Lisa</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Louvre</ENAMEX> drew almost unmanageable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowds</ENAMEX> until <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitterrand</ENAMEX> ordered its re-organization in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1980s</TIMEX>. An enormous new reception area was excavated (revealing parts of the original fort), topped by the superb glass <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Pyramid</ENAMEX> designed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">I. M. Pei</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cour Napol√©on</ENAMEX>, which now marks the museum‚Äôs main entrance.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">palace‚Äôs royal chapel</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">St-Germain l‚ÄôAuxerrois</ENAMEX>, dates back to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1200</TIMEX>, but has preserved little of its <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Romanesque</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gothic</ENAMEX> beginnings. Its bell tolled the signal in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1572</TIMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catholics</ENAMEX> to start the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">St Bartholomew Day</ENAMEX> massacre of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Protestants</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>).
Palais-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal</ENAMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Palais-Royal</ENAMEX>, across the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rue</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Rivoli</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Louvre</ENAMEX>, was built as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cardinal Richelieu‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1639</TIMEX> (it became ‚Äúroyal‚Äù when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anne</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Austria</ENAMEX> moved in with young <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Louis XIV</ENAMEX>). This serene, arcaded palace, with its garden of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">lime trees</ENAMEX> and beeches¬†‚Äî¬†and the pond where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Louis XIV</ENAMEX> nearly drowned¬<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">†‚Äî¬†has</ENAMEX> had a past as colorful as its spectacular new flower beds. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the days</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philippe d‚ÄôOrl√©ans</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prince</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Regent</ENAMEX> while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Louis XV</ENAMEX> was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Palais-Royal</ENAMEX> was the scene of notorious orgies. A later <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">duke</ENAMEX> (another <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philippe</ENAMEX>) added <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartments</ENAMEX> above the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arcades</ENAMEX>, along with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">theaters</ENAMEX> (one now the venerable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Com√©die Fran√ßaise</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, gambling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>, and fashionable caf√©s. In the ferment that led up to the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Revolution</ENAMEX>, it was a scene of furious debate. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13 July 1789</TIMEX> a young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">firebrand</ENAMEX> orator, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Camille Desmoulins</ENAMEX>, stood on a table at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Palais-Royal‚Äôs Caf√© de Foy</ENAMEX> to sound a call to arms. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bastille</ENAMEX> was stormed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next day</TIMEX>.
Despite efforts to curry favor with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">revolutionaries</ENAMEX>, like calling himself <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philippe Egalit√©</ENAMEX> (equality), the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">duke</ENAMEX> ended up on the guillotine with the rest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>. After the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Revolution</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> became a gambling den again and narrowly escaped destruction in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1871</TIMEX> uprising. Once it was restored, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1872 and 1876</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> became respectable. Today, it houses the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ministry of Culture</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Council of State</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Constitutional Council</ENAMEX>. Some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> still exist, and the sumptuously decorated <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Grand V√©four</ENAMEX> restaurant looks just the way it did <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">200 years ago</TIMEX>.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</TIMEX>, rows of black-and-white striped stone columns were added to the main quadrangle, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cour</ENAMEX> d‚ÄôHonneur. Some are short, some are tall, but a few are just the right height for sitting on.
Next to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Palais-Royal</ENAMEX> stands the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Banque de France</ENAMEX>, east of the garden (and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">landlord</ENAMEX> of most of its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartments</ENAMEX>), and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Biblioth√®que Nationale</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Library</ENAMEX>), just to the north. This began as a royal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1368</TIMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles V</ENAMEX> placed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">973</NUMEX> manuscripts in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Louvre</ENAMEX>. Most of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of books, engravings, and ancient manuscripts it has accumulated over the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX> have been transferred to the new national <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Left Bank</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">58</NUMEX>). The old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> with its splendid <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salle de Travail</ENAMEX> (reading <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1863</TIMEX>) is being transformed into a research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialist</ENAMEX> collections for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Les Halles</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">East</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Palais-Royal</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Les Halles</ENAMEX> was for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX> the site of the capital‚Äôs central <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> markets (now in a more spacious, if less colorful, location at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rungis</ENAMEX>, near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Orly</ENAMEX>). To widespread regret, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Victor Baltard‚</ENAMEX>Äôs great cast-iron and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glass pavilions</ENAMEX> were torn down in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1970s</TIMEX>. Eventually, gardens, children‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">playgrounds</ENAMEX>, and the maze-like, partly below-ground shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mall</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Forum des Halles</ENAMEX>, transformed the site. Saturdays bring throngs of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teenagers</ENAMEX> from the suburbs to shop, watch films, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">roller skate</ENAMEX>, munch fast food, and just hang out. The liveliest meeting place is around the monumental <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance Fontaine des Innocents</ENAMEX> (once part of a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cemetery</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bars</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">late-night</TIMEX> brasseries line the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">adjoining</NUMEX> rue <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> leading off it. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clubs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">discos</ENAMEX> come alive at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midnight</TIMEX> and stay open to <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">dawn</TIMEX>, especially on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekends</TIMEX>. Away from the gardens and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">playgrounds</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the quarter</TIMEX> has its seedy side: <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drink</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>, pickpockets and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prostitutes</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rue St-Denis</ENAMEX>, once primarily a red-light district, is now pedestrianized, but still has its share of sex <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>.
The remarkable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">St-Eustache</ENAMEX> dominates the north side of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Les Halles</ENAMEX>. Built from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1532 to 1637</TIMEX>, the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> is late <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gothic</ENAMEX> with a somewhat incongruous but imposing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> colonnade on its western <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fa√ßade</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> is renowned for its choral concerts and recitals on the grand organ designed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baltard</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Les Halles</ENAMEX>.
Beaubourg
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">East of the Forum des Halles</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> closed to traffic and lined with caf√©s, brasseries, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">art galleries</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boutiques</ENAMEX> link up with the startling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Centre Georges-Pompidou</ENAMEX>. This <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">avant-garde</ENAMEX> multimedia cultural <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>, which also houses the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Mus√©e National d‚ÄôArt Moderne</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">74</NUMEX>), reopened <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 January 2000</TIMEX> after lengthy renovation. Controversy raged for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> after the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1977</TIMEX> opening of this colorful ‚Äúoil <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">refinery</ENAMEX>.‚Äù The comparison came as no surprise to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architects</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Italy‚Äôs Renzo Piano</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Britain‚Äôs Richard Rogers</ENAMEX>, who deliberately left the building‚Äôs service <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">systems visible¬†‚Äî¬†and</ENAMEX> color-coded. Now, as with the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Tour Eiffel</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Louvre‚Äôs Pyramid</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have learned to live with it and even love it, and it averages <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX>.
Besides its permanent art collections and popular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> open to all, ingenious exhibits cover every aspect of contemporary life, artistic and technological, and the aesthetics of consumer culture. There is a particular emphasis on young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">place</ENAMEX> also offers a terrific view. Pay the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> admission, then take the escalators running in transparent tubes from the bottom left to the top right hand corner and see <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> unfold before your eyes. The sloping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plaza</ENAMEX> outside is one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paris‚</ENAMEX>Äô most popular locations for street <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">performers</ENAMEX>.
Place Vend√¥me
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis XIV</ENAMEX> wanted this most elegant of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> squares to provide an imposing setting for a monument to him. After it was laid out in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1699</TIMEX>, only <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Louis‚</ENAMEX>Äô <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">financiers</ENAMEX> could afford the rent. Now, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ministry of Justice</ENAMEX> shares the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX>, famous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">jewelers</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ritz Hotel</ENAMEX>. Like all royal statues, that of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Louis XIV</ENAMEX> was overthrown during the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Revolution</ENAMEX>. Its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">replacement</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Vend√¥me</ENAMEX> column, commemorates in bronze relief the victories of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Napol√©on</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cast</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,250</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Austrian</ENAMEX> cannons captured at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Austerlitz</ENAMEX> and topped by a statue of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emperor</ENAMEX>. It, too, was toppled, during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1871</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Commune</ENAMEX> at the instigation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painter</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gustave Courbet</ENAMEX>, who had to pay the crippling cost of having it re-erected <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years later</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Op√©ra-Garnier</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Grands</ENAMEX> Boulevards
Window-shop your way past the goldsmiths and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">furriers</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rue</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de la Paix</ENAMEX> to the ornate opera <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> (now named after its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Garnier</ENAMEX> to distinguish it from the new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Op√©ra-Bastille</ENAMEX>; see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">52</NUMEX>). Begun at the height of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Napol√©on III‚</ENAMEX>Äôs Second <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Empire</ENAMEX>, it was completed only in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1875</TIMEX>, after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commune</ENAMEX>. It is the epitome of the exuberance of a city regarding itself as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Europe‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most glamorous capital, an impression that is underscored by the grand <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">foyer</ENAMEX> and staircase. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>-tiered auditorium, with its incongruous modern ceiling painted by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chagall</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1964</TIMEX>, holds a mere <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spectators</ENAMEX>. Underneath the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> is a small lake which provided the inspiration for the phantom‚Äôs hiding place in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paul Leroux‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Phantom of the Opera</ENAMEX>. Now the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">home</ENAMEX> of the national <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ballet company</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> was renovated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>.
A stock exchange, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>, a theater: These were among the uses proposed for the huge neo-classical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madeleine</ENAMEX>, also recently renovated. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Napol√©on</ENAMEX> wanted it as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> of glory for his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX>, but his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX> suggested the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Arc de Triomphe</ENAMEX> instead. The restored monarchy opted for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>, as originally intended when <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> started under <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Louis XV</ENAMEX>. It was finally consecrated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1842</TIMEX>. Climb the steps for a great view down the rue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royale</ENAMEX> to the place <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de la Concorde</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Assembly</ENAMEX> beyond.
The renovated <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Mus√©e Jacqemart-Andr√©</ENAMEX> reopened in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">158</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">boulevard</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Haussmann</ENAMEX>, not far from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madeleine</ENAMEX>. Housed in the splendid <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansion</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">art collector</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edouard Andr√©</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> contains a fine collection of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Flemish</ENAMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> paintings.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grands Boulevards</ENAMEX>, running from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madeleine</ENAMEX> past the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Op√©ra-Garnier</ENAMEX> and all the way to place <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de la Bastille</ENAMEX>, comprised the fashionable heart of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1860s</TIMEX> until well into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 20th century</TIMEX>. They are less chic now, but their majestic sweep can still evoke former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">glories</ENAMEX>. On <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">boulevard des Capucines</ENAMEX>, retrace the footsteps of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Renoir</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manet</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pissarro</ENAMEX> as they took their paintings to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nadar‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>, signposted at number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX>, for the historic <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1874</TIMEX> exhibition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Impressionism</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nowadays</ENAMEX>, popular cinemas have found an appropriate home on the boulevards, for it was at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">H√¥tel Scribe</ENAMEX>, near the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Op√©ra</ENAMEX>, that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lumi√®re</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brothers</ENAMEX> staged the first public moving picture show in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1895</TIMEX>.
Montmartre
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montmartre</ENAMEX> is really a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">hilltop village (‚ÄúLa Butte‚Äù</ENAMEX> to its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX>), with narrow, winding <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> and dead-ends. For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last 200 years</TIMEX> it has been associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> and bohemians. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montmartrobus</ENAMEX> spares you the walk and shows you some of the area in a single tour, but the best way to discover <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Montmartre</ENAMEX> at your own pace is to start early, at the top. Take the m√©tro to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abbesses</ENAMEX> and the elevator to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> (the stairs here are endless) and notice the handsome <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Art Nouveau</ENAMEX> entrance as you leave. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rue</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Yvonne le Tac</ENAMEX> leads to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base station</ENAMEX> of a funicular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">railway</ENAMEX>. It was here that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">St.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Denis</ENAMEX> was martyred (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>) and where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Ignatius Loyola</ENAMEX> launched the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jesuit</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">movement</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1534</TIMEX>.
The funicular (it takes <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">m√©tro</ENAMEX> and bus tickets) climbs to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terrace</ENAMEX> in front of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Byzantine</ENAMEX>-style basilica of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Sacr√©-C≈ìur</ENAMEX>. Standing at the highest point in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX>, it‚Äôs one of the city‚Äôs principal landmarks, and one of the few to remain perennially controversial. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Artists</ENAMEX> still scorn it as a vulgar pastiche, and the working-class <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> of the area resented its being erected as a symbol of penitence for the insurrection of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1871</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Commune¬†‚Äî¬†they</ENAMEX> didn‚Äôt feel penitent in the least. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Sacr√©-C≈ìur‚</ENAMEX>Äôs conspicuous whiteness comes from the local <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ch√¢teau-Landon</ENAMEX> limestone, which bleaches on contact with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon dioxide</ENAMEX> in the air and hardens with age. For many, the best reason for visiting the basilica is the view of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dome</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terrace</ENAMEX> below.
Just a few steps west of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Sacr√©-C≈ìur</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">St-Pierre-de-Montmartre</ENAMEX>, one of the city‚Äôs oldest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Consecrated</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1147</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16 years</TIMEX> before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">St-Germain</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">des-Pr√©s</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">58</NUMEX>), it is a significant work of early <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gothic</ENAMEX>, belied by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">its 18th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">fa√ßade</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Sacr√©-C≈ìur‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Abadie</ENAMEX>, wanted to demolish <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">St-Pierre</ENAMEX>, but he was overruled, and it was restored ‚Äúas a riposte to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Sacr√©-C≈ìur</ENAMEX>.‚Äù
Nearby place du <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tertre</ENAMEX> was once the center of village life. Try to visit during the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early morning</TIMEX>, before the mass-production <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> set up their easels and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowds</ENAMEX> take over.
In place <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Emile Goudeau</ENAMEX>, just downhill but artistically on an altogether much higher level, number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> was the site of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">studio</ENAMEX> known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bateau-Lavoir</ENAMEX> (so-called because the building resembled the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Seine‚Äôs</ENAMEX> laundry <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX>, before it was destroyed by fire). Here, if in any one place, modern art was born: <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Picasso</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Braque</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Juan Gris</ENAMEX> developed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cubism; Modigliani</ENAMEX> painted in a style all his own; and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Apollinaire</ENAMEX> wrote his first surrealistic verses. Some of their <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">predecessors¬†‚Äî¬†Renoir</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">van Gogh</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Gauguin¬†‚Äî¬†once</ENAMEX> lived and worked just north of place <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">du Tertre</ENAMEX> in rue <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cortot</ENAMEX>, rue de l‚ÄôAbreuvoir, and rue <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">St-Rustique</ENAMEX>.
On the rue <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">St-Vincent</ENAMEX> at the corner of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rue des Saules</ENAMEX>, look out for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paris‚Äô</ENAMEX> last surviving <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">vineyard</ENAMEX>, the tiny <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clos de Montmartre</ENAMEX>, producing a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> that reputedly ‚Äúmakes you jump like a goat.‚Äù
At the far end of rue <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lepic</ENAMEX>, a market street renowned for its food <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, is place <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blanche</ENAMEX>, where everything suddenly changes. You hit <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">boulevard Clichy</ENAMEX>, or it hits you. Right on the corner is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moulin Rouge</ENAMEX>, still staging its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nightly</TIMEX> cabarets, mostly to package <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX>. All the way east to place <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pigalle</ENAMEX> and beyond runs a ribbon of tawdry nightlife, with sex <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, peep shows, and other dubious attractions, punctuated by a few conventional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bars</ENAMEX>. By <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</TIMEX>, tour <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">buses</ENAMEX> from all over <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> are parked bumper to bumper. Avoid the late-night <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">m√©tro</ENAMEX> here, unless you want to share it with reeling drunks.
The principal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cemetery</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montmartre</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">luminaries</ENAMEX> of the arts such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">composers</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berlioz</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Offenbach</ENAMEX> lie buried, may seem a world away, but it‚Äôs only a short walk west from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moulin Rouge</ENAMEX> to the entrance (west past the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moulin Rouge</ENAMEX>, then right at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">avenue Rachel</ENAMEX>).
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Le Marais</ENAMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">district</ENAMEX> to the north of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ile de la Cit√©</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ile Saint-Louis</ENAMEX> has bravely withstood the onslaught of modern construction. It provides a remarkably authentic record of the development of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, from the reign of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henri IV</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the 16th century</TIMEX> to the advent of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Revolution</ENAMEX>. Built on reclaimed marshland, as its name suggests, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Marais</ENAMEX> contains some of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Europe‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most elegant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansions</ENAMEX> (h√¥tels), many of which now serve as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> major change is the recent influx of trendy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boutiques</ENAMEX>.
Take the m√©tro to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rambuteau</ENAMEX> and start at the corner of the rue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">des Archives</ENAMEX> and the rue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">des Francs-Bourgeois</ENAMEX>, named after the poor (not bourgeois at all) allowed to live here tax-free in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 14th century</TIMEX>. The national archives are stored in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">an 18th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansion</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H√¥tel de Soubise</ENAMEX>. Across a vast, horseshoe-shaped <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX>, you come across the exquisite <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rococo</ENAMEX> style of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Louis XV‚</ENAMEX>Äôs time in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartments</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prince</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Princess</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Soubise</ENAMEX>. Up on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mus√©e de l‚ÄôHistoire de France</ENAMEX>, with gems such as the only known portrait of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joan</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arc</ENAMEX> painted in her <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">lifetime</TIMEX> and the diary kept by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Louis XVI</ENAMEX>. His entry for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14 July 1789</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bastille</ENAMEX> was stormed, reads <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rien</ENAMEX> (Nothing).
A garden (not always open to the public) connects the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H√¥tel de Soubise</ENAMEX> with its twin, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H√¥tel de Rohan</ENAMEX>, on the rue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vieille du Temple</ENAMEX>. Look out for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Robert le Lorrain‚</ENAMEX>Äôs fine <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Les Chevaux</ENAMEX> d‚ÄôApollon over the old stables in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX>, admired as one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">France‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most beautiful <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th-century</TIMEX> sculptures.
Also on the rue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">des Francs-Bourgeois, H√¥tel Carnavalet</ENAMEX>, once home of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX> of letters, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Madame de S√©vign√©</ENAMEX>, is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mus√©e Carnavalet</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">75</NUMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Mus√©e Picasso</ENAMEX>, nearby at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rue</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thorigny</ENAMEX>, is housed in the beautifully restored <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">H√¥tel Sal√©</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">71</NUMEX>).
The rue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">des Francs-Bourgeois</ENAMEX> ends at what most agree is the loveliest residential <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX>, place des <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Vosges</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henri IV</ENAMEX> had it laid out in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1605</TIMEX> on the site of an old¬†horse-market, his idea (borrowed from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Catherine de‚ÄôMedici</ENAMEX>) being to have ‚Äúall the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> in the same symmetry.‚Äù After the wedding festivities of his son <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis XIII</ENAMEX>, the gardens became the fashionable place to promenade, and later a spot for aristocratic duels. Today, there‚Äôs a children‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">playground</ENAMEX> and it is perfect for just sitting around¬†‚Äî¬†on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">grass</ENAMEX>, too.
On of the best times to see the square‚Äôs architecture is in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the winter</TIMEX>, when the chestnut <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> are bare and don‚Äôt obscure the pink brick and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">honey-colored stone fa√ßades</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Victor Hugo</ENAMEX>, author of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Les Mis√©rables</ENAMEX>, lived at number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>, now a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> housing many of his manuscripts, artifacts, and wonderful drawings.
While in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marais</ENAMEX>, take a wander around the old <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Jewish quarter</TIMEX> (or shtetl, as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parisian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> call it), especially if you are looking for somewhere unusual to eat. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> have lived around the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rue des Rosiers</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rue</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferdinand Duval</ENAMEX> was known until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1900</TIMEX> as the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rue des Juifs</ENAMEX>. The other main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>, rue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">des Ecouffes</ENAMEX> (medieval slang for moneylenders), completes the lively shopping area, with delicatessens, kosher butchers, and even kosher pizza <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>. More recent arrivals from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North Africa</ENAMEX> have largely replaced the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ashkenazim of Eastern Europe</ENAMEX>, who themselves took the place of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Sephardim</ENAMEX> who first settled in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 13th century</TIMEX>.
Bastille
The large, circular place <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de la Bastille</ENAMEX> is enjoying a new lease on life. No trace remains of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prison</ENAMEX> stormed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1789</TIMEX>; even the column in the center commemorates a later revolution, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that of 1830</TIMEX>. Long a run-down area, it was given a shot in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> by the construction of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Op√©ra-Bastille</ENAMEX>, one of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitterrand‚</ENAMEX>Äôs great projects. This opened in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX> to a chorus of hostile comment. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Critics</ENAMEX> attacked <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carlos Ott‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> as an unimaginative misfit. At least the acoustics are rated a success, and the new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Opera</ENAMEX> is now an accepted part of the cultural life of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX>. In the adjacent <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rue</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de la Couronne</ENAMEX>, traditional old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> alternate with art <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">galleries</ENAMEX>, artists‚Äô <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">studios</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>. Just to the northeast of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Op√</ENAMEX>©ra in rue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">de la Main</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">d‚</ENAMEX>ÄôOr, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rue</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Lappe</ENAMEX>, and their offshoots, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clubs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">discos</ENAMEX> have revived an old nightlife tradition.
Left <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bank</ENAMEX>
Despite the concerted efforts of the fashion and media worlds to move in on it, the bohemians and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intellectuals</ENAMEX> hang on to their time-honored stronghold on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Left Bank</ENAMEX> (rive gauche). There is much more to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Left Bank</ENAMEX> than the student life of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latin Quarter</ENAMEX>, but so many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">colleges</ENAMEX> are packed into a small area that it‚Äôs the young who set the pace. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Writers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painters</ENAMEX> who used to meet regularly in the caf√©s of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">St-Germain</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">des-Pr√</ENAMEX>©s often find themselves squeezed out by film <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX>, TV <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">performers</ENAMEX>, advertising <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, and more and more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montparnasse</ENAMEX> took over from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montmartre</ENAMEX> as the haunt of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">avant-garde</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1920s</TIMEX> and still stakes a claim. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Left Bank</ENAMEX> has its share of monuments and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Les Jardins</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">du Luxembourg</ENAMEX> remain an evergreen favorite.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latin Quarter</ENAMEX>
As far back as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 13th century</TIMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paris‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">university</ENAMEX> moved from the cloisters of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Notre-Dame</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Left Bank</ENAMEX>, the young came to the quartier to learn <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Latin</ENAMEX>. Here, the tradition of scholastic inquiry has often evolved into a spirit of protest and outright revolt before subsiding into a lifelong skepticism.
In ancient days the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">university</ENAMEX> simply meant a collection of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX> who met on a street <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">corner</ENAMEX> or in a public <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX> to listen to a lecture given from a bench or balcony. Now the tradition of open-air discussion continues over <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX> or a glass of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> on some caf√© <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terrace</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">boulevard</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">St-Michel</ENAMEX> or in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> around the faculty <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>.
The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">quarter</TIMEX> also includes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">France‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> most prestigious high <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Lyc√©es Henri IV</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Louis le Grand</ENAMEX>, training grounds for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">France‚</ENAMEX>Äôs future <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">√©lite</ENAMEX>.
Begin your visit to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Latin¬</ENAMEX>†Quarter at the place <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">St-Michel</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> buy their books and stationery or gather around the bombastic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1860s</ENAMEX> fountain by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Davioud</ENAMEX>. Plunge into the narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">St-S√</ENAMEX>©verin <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">quarter</TIMEX> to the east (rue <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">St-S√©verin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rue</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de la Harpe</ENAMEX>, and rue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Galande</ENAMEX>). You will discover a medieval world updated by the varied exotica of smoky <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> barbecues, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tunisian</ENAMEX> pastry <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, and art-house cinemas.
Little <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">St-Julien-le-Pauvre</ENAMEX>, a jewel of early <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Gothic</ENAMEX> architecture dating from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1165 and 1220</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hosts</ENAMEX> recitals of chamber and religious music. With its wafting incense and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">masses</ENAMEX> said in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Arabic</ENAMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> belongs to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Melchite</ENAMEX> sect of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek Orthodox</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Church</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">St-Julien</ENAMEX> is not out of place in an area packed with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Middle Eastern</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>. Just across rue <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">St-Jacques</ENAMEX> stands the exquisite <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13th- to 15th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Flamboyant Gothic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">St-S√©verin</ENAMEX>, in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dante</ENAMEX> is said to have prayed and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint-Sa√´ns</ENAMEX> asked to be made honorary organist.
The Sorbonne
Named after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 13th-century</TIMEX> college established by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert de¬†Sorbon</ENAMEX> for poor theological <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">university</ENAMEX> was later taken in hand by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cardinal Richelieu</ENAMEX>, who financed its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reconstruction</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1624‚Äì1642</ENAMEX>). Few of the somewhat forbidding <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> are open to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX>, but you can go inside <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX> with its ornate sundial and see the outside of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baroque</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> and domed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>. Protest against overcrowding, antiquated teaching, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bureaucracy</ENAMEX>, and the very basis of the social system made the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sorbonne</ENAMEX> a focal point for unrest in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1968</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> of ferment throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. Over on the quiet, tree-shaded place <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de la Sorbonne</ENAMEX>, it‚Äôs hard to imagine the police invading such a peaceful sanctuary¬<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">†‚Äî¬†one</ENAMEX> that for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX> guaranteed student immunity. But invade they did, and revolt exploded onto the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Students</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> made common cause, and there followed widespread national strikes that threatened the survival of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>. In the aftermath of the revolts, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sorbonne</ENAMEX> was absorbed into the huge <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Universities monolith</ENAMEX> and lost its independence.
Standing virtually opposite the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sorbonne‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rue des Ecoles</ENAMEX> entrance, at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> place <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul-Painlev√©</ENAMEX>, are the massive brick ruins of the ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> public <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">baths</ENAMEX>. They survived as part of an abbey¬†‚Äî¬†now the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mus√©e National du Moyen Age</ENAMEX>, still often called by its former name, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mus√©e de Cluny</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">72</NUMEX>). Its most famous exhibits are the wonderful <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15th-century</TIMEX> tapestries, including the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lady</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unicorn</ENAMEX>.
Panth√©on
A stroll up the rue <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">St-Jacques</ENAMEX> past the highly reputed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lyc√©e Louis le Grand</ENAMEX> leads to the gigantic neo-classical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Panth√©on.</ENAMEX> Designed for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Louis XV</ENAMEX> as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Ste-Genevi√®ve</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1755</TIMEX>), it was secularized during the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Revolution</ENAMEX> to serve as a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mausoleum</ENAMEX>. For most of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th century</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Panth√</ENAMEX>©on oscillated between secular and consecrated status, according to the current r√©gime‚Äôs political persuasion. Finally <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Victor Hugo‚</ENAMEX>Äôs gigantic funeral in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1885</TIMEX> settled the issue in favor of a secular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mausoleum</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Novelist Emile Zola</ENAMEX>, socialist <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jean Jaur√®s</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L√©on Gambetta</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1870</TIMEX> siege of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis Braille</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inventor</ENAMEX> of the blind alphabet), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierre</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marie Curie</ENAMEX> (discoverers of radium, honored only in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>; she being the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Panth√</ENAMEX>©on‚Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>), and many other national <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heroes</ENAMEX> are interred here.
The bare interior is bleak, its windows covered up by the monumental <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19th-century</TIMEX> murals painted by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Puvis de Chavannes</ENAMEX>. The crypt is a grim maze of corridors lined with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> containing the tombs of the famous, as well as the not-so-famous. A good display on the history of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Panth√</ENAMEX>©on is the best part of the visit.
Come back to life on the old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Panth√©on</ENAMEX>, where the bustling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rue</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mouffetard</ENAMEX> and its offshoots are a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> within the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stalls</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX> market (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">85</NUMEX>) are piled with appetizing produce. Here and in the tiny place <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de la Contrescarpe</ENAMEX> you will find a large choice of ethnic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, especially <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Thai</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Vietnamese</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX>.
A block to the east, signs to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ar√®nes de Lut√</ENAMEX>®ce lead you to a little <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>, site of a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> amphitheater, restored after its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">remains</ENAMEX> were found during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th century</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jardins du Luxembourg</ENAMEX>
Bright with <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> and statues of historical figures peeping out from among the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">bushes</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jardins du Luxembourg</ENAMEX> are the prettiest green space on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Left Bank</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Students</ENAMEX> find quiet corners to read, relax, or play <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">tennis</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> sail their <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> on the octagonal pond or ride a merry-go-round designed by none other than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Garnier</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Op√©ra</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45</NUMEX>). Old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> meet under the chestnut <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> to play chess or a game of boules. At the north end of the gardens, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Palais du Luxembourg</ENAMEX>, built for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marie</ENAMEX> de‚ÄôMedici <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early in the 17th century</TIMEX>, now houses the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">French Senate</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East</ENAMEX> along the Seine
Back down by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seine</ENAMEX>, but heading east, stroll past the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jussieu University</ENAMEX> complex that stands on the site of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Halles</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aux</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vins</ENAMEX> (wine market). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institut du Monde Arabe</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arab World Institute</ENAMEX>), at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">quai</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">St-Bernard</ENAMEX>, was built with the help of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nations</ENAMEX> to foster cultural links between <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Islamic</ENAMEX> world. The fine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> inside traces the cultures of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> world, both the pre-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Islamic</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Islamic</ENAMEX> periods, with first-rate temporary exhibits. The best way to see them is to start on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">seventh</NUMEX> floor and work down. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 40,000</NUMEX> volumes covers all aspects of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> culture. The view from the rooftop <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cafeteria</ENAMEX> is better than the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> for anyone hoping to sample the joys of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cuisine</ENAMEX>, however.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jardin des Plantes</ENAMEX> next door, created by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Louis XIII</ENAMEX> as ‚Äúa royal garden of medicinal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>,‚Äù is still an excellent botanical and decorative garden, with exotic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> in the hothouses.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adjoining Museum National d‚ÄôHistoire Naturelle</ENAMEX> has done a fine job of renovating its venerable exhibits of fossils, skeletons, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">butterflies</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mineral samples</ENAMEX>. Outstanding is the superbly designed new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Grande Galerie de l‚ÄôEvolution</ENAMEX> (entrance at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rue</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Geoffroy-St-Hilaire</ENAMEX>) devoted to the origins of all life on earth, not just centered on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homo sapiens</ENAMEX>.
With its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> glass <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">towers</ENAMEX> in the shape of open books, the new national <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Biblioth√®que Fran√ßois Mitterand</ENAMEX>, is the flagship <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> of the redeveloped <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tolbiac</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">district</ENAMEX> east of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gare</ENAMEX> d‚ÄôAusterlitz. The vast riverfront <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> surrounding a sunken garden of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 250</NUMEX> exotic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> is popularly known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGB</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Tr√®s Grand Biblioth√®que</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚ÄúVery Big Library‚Äù</ENAMEX>). More formally, it also bears the name of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fran√ßois Mitterrand</ENAMEX>, for whom it was the ultimate (but posthumous) achievement of his ambitious building program for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX>. Opened in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late 1996</TIMEX>, it houses <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 12,000,000</NUMEX> books and has a state-of-the-art electronic retrieval system that‚Äôs open to the general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> and research <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">St-Germain</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">des-Pr√</ENAMEX>©s
This <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Left Bank</ENAMEX> area is one of the town‚Äôs most attractive neighborhoods. Not part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latin Quarter</ENAMEX>, but an extension of it, this is the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">home</ENAMEX> of numerous publishing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acad√©mie Fran√ßaise</ENAMEX>, expensive interior design and fashion <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, bookshops, and caf√© terraces ideal for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>-watching. It used to be the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jean-Paul Sartre</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">existentialist acolytes</ENAMEX> wearing, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX>, black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">corduroys</ENAMEX> and long woolen scarves. In place <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">St-Germain</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">des-Pr√©s</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Caf√© Bonaparte</ENAMEX> on the north side and the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Deux Magots</ENAMEX> on the west provide ringside seats for a street <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">theater</ENAMEX> of mimes, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">musicians</ENAMEX>, and neighborhood <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">eccentrics</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caf√© de Flore</ENAMEX> round the corner has hung on to its intellectual tradition more than the others, perhaps because of its rather ideologically confused history. It‚Äôs been a home-away-from-home for the extreme right <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Action Fran√ßaise</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> under <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Maurras</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1899</TIMEX>; the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poet</ENAMEX> and surrealist precursor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apollinaire</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1914</TIMEX> (who, with his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>, liked to provoke brawls); and, during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1950s</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sartre‚</ENAMEX>Äôs existentialists, a peaceful bunch who never got enough sleep to have the energy to fight.
Also on the place <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">St-Germain</ENAMEX> stands the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">St-Germain</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">des-Pr√©s</ENAMEX>, the oldest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX>. It is a mixture of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Romanesque</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gothic</ENAMEX>, with a clock <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> dating from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about the year 1000 and a 17th-century</TIMEX> porch sheltering <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">doorposts</ENAMEX>. Restored after being used in the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Revolution</ENAMEX> as a gunpowder <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factory</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> is a popular venue for concerts.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rue</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bonaparte</ENAMEX> leads past the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ecole Nationale Sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fine Arts School</ENAMEX>). This structure incorporates fragments of medieval and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> architecture and sculpture that make it a living <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>. During the events of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 1968</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> used it as a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factory</ENAMEX> for militant posters.
The august <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palais de l‚ÄôInstitut de France</ENAMEX>, home of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acad√©mie Fran√ßaise</ENAMEX>, is on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">quai</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Conti</ENAMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pont des Arts</ENAMEX>. Designed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Louis le Vau</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1668</TIMEX> to harmonize with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Louvre</ENAMEX> across the river, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institut</ENAMEX> began as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sons</ENAMEX> of provincial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gentry</ENAMEX>, financed by a legacy of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cardinal Mazarin</ENAMEX>. Then in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1805</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> was turned over to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institut</ENAMEX>, which comprises the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acad√©mie Fran√ßaise</ENAMEX>, supreme <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arbiter</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">French</ENAMEX> language founded by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cardinal Richelieu</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1635</TIMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acad√©mies des Belles-Lettres, Sciences</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beaux-Arts</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sciences Morales et Politiques</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guides</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institut</ENAMEX> like to point out the east <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pavilion</ENAMEX>, site of the old <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Tour de Nesle</ENAMEX>. They say that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Queen Jeanne de Bourgogne</ENAMEX> used the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> to watch out for likely young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lovers</ENAMEX>, whom she summoned for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the night</TIMEX> and then had thrown into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seine</ENAMEX>.
Montparnasse
Named after the mountain home of antiquity‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Muses</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Paris‚Äôs ‚ÄúMount Parnassus‚Äù</ENAMEX> was a mound left after quarrying¬†‚Äî¬†long gone, but remaining an inspiration to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX>. They invented the cancan here in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1845</TIMEX> in a local dance <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX>, and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1920s</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the quarter</TIMEX> took over from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montmartre</ENAMEX> as the stamping ground of the city‚Äôs artistic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX>, led by <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Picasso</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expatriates</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hemingway</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gertrude Stein</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">F. Scott Fitzgerald</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John</ENAMEX> dos <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Passos</ENAMEX> liked the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">free-</ENAMEX>living atmosphere and added to the mystique themselves (see opposite page). The attraction isn‚Äôt immediately evident: The wide, straight <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">boulevard</ENAMEX> du <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Montparnasse</ENAMEX> is plain by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> standards. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nowadays</ENAMEX>, the majority of the haunts where the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚ÄúLost Generation‚</ENAMEX>Äù found itself have been polished and painted, or even entirely rebuilt, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> still pay elevated prices for the privilege of sitting in a seat that might once have been warmed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Modigliani</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lenin</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sartre</ENAMEX>.
The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">59</NUMEX>-story, black <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Tour Montparnasse</ENAMEX> may be an egregious eyesore, but the view from the top is marvelous (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX> avenue <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">du Maine</ENAMEX>, open <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:30am‚Äì10pm</TIMEX>).
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">East</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">station</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cemetery</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>), entrance on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">boulevard</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edgar Quinet</ENAMEX>, is the resting-place of some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">famous</ENAMEX> and controversial figures in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> history.
Invalides
Geographically if not temperamentally part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Left Bank</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Palais-Bourbon</ENAMEX> is the seat of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Assembl√©e Nationale</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">parliament</ENAMEX>). Designed for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Louis XIV</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1722</TIMEX>, it makes a stately riverside fa√ßade for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 7th</TIMEX> arrondissement, with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">its 18th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">embassies</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ministries</ENAMEX>, and private <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansions</ENAMEX> (h√¥tels particuliers). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Napol√©on</ENAMEX> added the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grecian</ENAMEX> columns facing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pont de la</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Concorde</ENAMEX>, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> is more graceful seen from its entrance on the south side. Access is available only on written request or invitation by a deputy. A privileged few get to see the great <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D√©lacroix</ENAMEX> paintings in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX>, illustrating the history of civilization.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prime Minister‚</ENAMEX>Äôs splendid <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H√¥tel Matignon</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">57</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rue</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Varenne</ENAMEX>, is a short walk from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Assembly.</ENAMEX> Its private <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> has a music <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pavilion</ENAMEX> favored for secret strategy sessions. On the same elegant <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mus√©e Rodin</ENAMEX> at number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">77</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> the sculptor‚Äôs works in the delightful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H√¥tel Biron</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">75</NUMEX>).
Most important sight in the neighborhood is the monumental <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H√¥tel des Invalides</ENAMEX>, established by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Louis XIV</ENAMEX> as the first national <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> and retirement <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">home</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX> wounded in action. At <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time it housed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 6,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">veterans</ENAMEX>, but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Napol√©on</ENAMEX> took over a large part of it for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mus√©e de l‚ÄôArm√©e</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Army Museum</ENAMEX>). Then the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Invalides</ENAMEX> came to symbolize the glory of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Napol√©on</ENAMEX> himself, when his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">remains</ENAMEX> were finally brought back from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Helena</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1840</TIMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">burial</ENAMEX> in the chapel under the golden <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">D√¥me</ENAMEX>. His <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX>, who died in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vienna</ENAMEX>, is buried in the crypt, his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">remains</ENAMEX> transferred here by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adolf Hitler</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1940</TIMEX>.
The main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX> allows access to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">adjoining church</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">St-Louis-des-Invalides</ENAMEX>, decorated with flags taken by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">armies</ENAMEX> in battle. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX> itself contains the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> cannons, including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> taken from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vienna</ENAMEX>, which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Napol√©on</ENAMEX> ordered fired on great occasions¬†‚Äî¬†including the birth of his son in¬<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">†1811</NUMEX>. The cannon sounded again for the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1918</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Armistice</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">funeral</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Marshal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Foch</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1929</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southwest of the Invalides</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ecole Militaire</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> have trained since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the middle of the 18th century</TIMEX>. Their former parade ground, the vast <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Champ de Mars</ENAMEX>, is now a green park stretching all the way to the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Tour Eiffel</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Horse</ENAMEX> races were held here in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1780s</TIMEX>, and also <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World Fairs</ENAMEX> between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1867 and 1937</TIMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 20th century</TIMEX>, it has become the front lawn of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Left Bank‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most luxurious <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residences</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">It‚Äôs</ENAMEX> also popular with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expatriates</ENAMEX>, who often can be seen playing <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">touch football</ENAMEX> or softball games.
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Tour Eiffel</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Eiffel Tower</ENAMEX>)
What remains for most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> the ultimate monument was a resounding success right from the start. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1889</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> paid <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5 francs</NUMEX> a head to climb to the top and it has bewitched the world ever since.
Some monuments celebrate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heroes</ENAMEX>, commemorate victories, honor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">kings</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">saints</ENAMEX>. This is a monument for its own sake. Its construction for the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1889</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">World‚Äôs Fair</ENAMEX> was an astounding engineering achievement¬†‚Äî¬†some <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15,000</NUMEX> pieces of metal joined by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,500,000</NUMEX> rivets, soaring <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">320 m</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">984 ft</ENAMEX>) into the sky on a base <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only 130 m</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">430 ft</ENAMEX>) across. At the time, it was the tallest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> in the world. It also provided the perfect perch for transmitters when radio and TV came along.
On the tower‚Äôs inauguration, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lifts</ENAMEX> were not yet in operation and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prime Minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tirard</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">aged 62</TIMEX>, stopped at the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platform</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">57 m</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">187 ft</ENAMEX>) up, letting his younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Minister</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commerce</ENAMEX> continue to the top to present <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Gustave Eiffel</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legion</ENAMEX> of Honor medal. Conceived as a temporary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> just for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fair</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> was slated for destruction in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1910</TIMEX>, but nobody had the heart to take it down. New illumination was installed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1985</TIMEX> to light up the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> from within, and it was the obvious main focus of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">France‚</ENAMEX>Äôs celebrations for the change of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the millennium</TIMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>.
An audio-visual show about the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> is screened on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platform</ENAMEX>; there are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>, and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX> on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX>. On clear <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>, the view from the top extends <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 65 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">40 miles</NUMEX>), but more often the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> platform offers the best view. Try to get there <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an hour</TIMEX> before sunset for the best light.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Western Outskirts</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bois de Boulogne</ENAMEX>
The capital‚Äôs biggest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> runs along the west side of the chic <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">16th</NUMEX> arrondissement. It covers <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">900 hectares</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2,200 acres</NUMEX>) of grassland, lakes, and woods. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Napol√©on III</ENAMEX> had <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Baron</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Haussmann</ENAMEX> transform this remnant of an old hunting forest along the lines of a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bagatelle</ENAMEX>, once a royal retreat, has a very lovely <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> garden, bursting with <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> during spring and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early summer</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jardin</ENAMEX> d‚ÄôAcclimatation is an amusement <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> with plenty of attractions for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>: shows, rides, and a small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">zoo</ENAMEX>. There are <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bikes</ENAMEX> for rent outside its entrance for exploring the rest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mus√©e des Arts et Traditions Populaires</ENAMEX> has excellent displays of folk art and crafts through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the ages</TIMEX>. Also within the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> are a boating lake and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> fine racecourses, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Longchamp</ENAMEX> for flat races and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Auteuil</ENAMEX> for steeplechases. But beware: In spite of police patrols, after dark parts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bois de Boulogne</ENAMEX> are reckoned to be the most dangerous places in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La D√</ENAMEX>©fense
Follow the long avenue <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de la Grande-Arm√</ENAMEX>©e down from l‚ÄôEtoile and the battery of towers looms bigger and bigger beyond the elegant, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">leafy</TIMEX> suburb of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Neuilly</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cross</ENAMEX> the river and you are in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mini-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manhattan</ENAMEX> that has sprouted since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1969</TIMEX> to become a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> in its own right. In the process, it has somehow managed to get a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soul</ENAMEX>, in spite of the inhuman scale of some of its windswept spaces.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grande Arche</ENAMEX> is farther away than most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">towers</ENAMEX>, and only when you get close do you realize just how big it is. A <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">hollow cube 110 m</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">360 ft</ENAMEX>) high and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">106 m</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">347 ft</ENAMEX>) wide, it could straddle the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Champs-Elys√©es</ENAMEX> and tuck <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Notre-Dame</ENAMEX> underneath it. Built with remarkable speed (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Danish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johann-Otto von Sprekelsen</ENAMEX> won the contest in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1983</TIMEX> and it was ready for the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">bicentennial</TIMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">French Revolution</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX>), the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grande Arche</ENAMEX> stands on an axis with the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Arc de Triomphe and the Cour Carr√©e of the Louvre</ENAMEX>. Its white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gables</ENAMEX> are clothed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Carrara</ENAMEX> marble, the outer fa√ßades with a combination of grey marble and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glass</ENAMEX>; the inside walls are covered with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aluminum</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> ‚Äúlegs‚Äù contain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>, while the roof <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> conference <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> and exhibition <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">space</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bubble</ENAMEX> lifts whisk you up through a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiberglass</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Teflon ‚Äúcloud</ENAMEX>,‚Äù held by steel cables that stretch from one wall to the other, but the ride to the top is expensive and the view not much more striking than from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terrace</ENAMEX>.
Increasing numbers of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> and office-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> have given rise to more and more <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, cinemas, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the cinemas, near the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grande Arche</ENAMEX>, has a big wrap-around IMAX screen, and in the same building the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mus√©e de l‚</ENAMEX>ÄôAutomobile displays over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> classic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX>, restored to mint condition. Across the main concourse a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">12-m</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39</NUMEX>-ft) bronze thumb by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C√©sar</ENAMEX> sticks out like, well, a sore thumb. Stroll down the tiers of terraces and you‚Äôll find many more statues, fountains, and murals by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mir√≥</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Calder</ENAMEX>, and other modern <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX>, all detailed on street-plans given out at information desks.
Major Museums
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mus√©e du Louvre</ENAMEX>
Revamping the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Mus√©e du Louvre</ENAMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1980s</TIMEX> has made this formidable palace of art far more accessible, in all senses. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1793</TIMEX>, when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Revolution</ENAMEX> declared the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> a national <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Louvre</ENAMEX> held <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">630</NUMEX> works of art; a recent inventory listed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250,000</NUMEX>. Don‚Äôt be put <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">off¬†‚Äî¬†it‚</ENAMEX>Äôs an exhilarating experience just attempting to come to grips with such vast collections of painting, sculpture, and artifacts from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5000 b.c. to 1848</TIMEX> (from which date the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Mus√©e d‚ÄôOrsay‚Äôs French</ENAMEX> collections continue the story to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1914</TIMEX>).
The magnificent glass <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Pyramid</ENAMEX> designed by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">I. M. Pei</ENAMEX> has gained acceptance as a harmonious entrance to this most venerable of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX>. An escalator descends to the reception area, which comprises <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, caf√©s, and the ticket <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>. At the information counter, collect a copy of the free handbook with color-coded floor plans. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Admission</ENAMEX>, too, is free on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first Sunday</TIMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every month</TIMEX>.)
Broad corridors lead to the various parts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> have made heroic efforts to help you find your way through the labyrinth. Each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> main <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wings</ENAMEX> is named after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">France‚</ENAMEX>Äôs great <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">figures</ENAMEX>: the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Richelieu</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sully</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX> in the east, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Denon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX> beside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seine</ENAMEX>. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX> is¬†then divided into numbered areas, which are shown on the floor plans (in color). The locations of some of the most famous exhibits are pinpointed. You will get lost at times, but in so doing you may discover marvels you weren‚Äôt even looking for.
On a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> visit, you may like to spend <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a half-day</TIMEX> just seeing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">highlights¬†‚Äî¬†with</ENAMEX> time off for postcard shopping and a caf√© break. For the collections, the acoustiguide (recorded tour available in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>) can be useful. Some of the highlights:

Mus√©e d‚ÄôOrsay
‚ÄúThe <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX> is superb and truly looks like a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fine Arts Museum</ENAMEX>, and since the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fine Arts Museum</ENAMEX> resembles a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX>, I suggest‚Ä¶ we make the change while we still can,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painter</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edouard Detaille</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1900</TIMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</TIMEX>, his joke became a reality. Linked to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Right Bank Jardins des Tuileries</ENAMEX> by the new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Passerelle Solf√</ENAMEX>©rino footbridge, the converted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19th-century</TIMEX> hotel-cum-railway <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX> was transformed into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mus√</ENAMEX>©e d‚ÄôOrsay, devoted to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> art from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1848 to 1914</TIMEX>. Keeping the exterior much as it was, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gae Aulenti</ENAMEX> adapted the interior to house many of the previously scattered works of that period, including the superb Impressionist collections formerly held in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jeu de Paume</ENAMEX>. Sculpture is well represented, and photography is present from its inception (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1839</TIMEX>).
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Orsay</ENAMEX> is one of the easiest of great <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX> to navigate: The free floor plan and signs are both crystal clear. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Newcomers</ENAMEX> may prefer to start at the top with the Impressionists and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post-Impressionists</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Renoir</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C√©zanne</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manet</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monet</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toulouse-Lautrec, Degas</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Van Gogh</ENAMEX> (this is the best collection of his work outside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX>, with several works from the frenzied <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> of activity before he died in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1890</TIMEX>). Outstanding in the ground floor collections are the vast canvases of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gustave Courbet</ENAMEX>.
Every part of the old terminus has been used in a highly imaginative way, and frequent lectures, guided tours, and concerts are scheduled. When you need a break, there is a caf√© high up behind a huge clock, and on the middle level the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">station</ENAMEX> hotel‚Äôs beautifully restored <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX> is back in use. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Orsay</ENAMEX> is also one of the few <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX> that is air-conditioned, and is thus a refreshing retreat on a hot day.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Centre Georges</ENAMEX>-Pompidou
‚ÄúThat‚Äôll get them screaming,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù</ENAMEX> said then <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Georges Pompidou</ENAMEX>, as he approved the plans (chosen from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">681</NUMEX> competing designs) for the cultural <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> formally bearing his name, but more popularly known as simply <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beaubourg</ENAMEX>, after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">its 13th-century</TIMEX> neighborhood.
It was re-opened in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 2000</TIMEX> after extensive renovation. The combination of public <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">1st‚Äì3rd</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floors</ENAMEX>), children‚Äôs and adult workshops (ground floor), cin√©math√®que, industrial design <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">center</ENAMEX>, and music laboratory has made the complex a constant hive of activity. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plaza</ENAMEX> outside is a popular rendezvous point for its free shows. The excellent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Museum of Modern Art</ENAMEX> on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">5th</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1905‚Äì1960</ENAMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">4th</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX> (contemporary) provides a rewarding education in all the disparate art movements of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 20th century</TIMEX>. The collections, regularly rotated from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45,000</NUMEX> works in reserve, range from the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Fauves and Cubism to Abstract Expressionism</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dadaism, Surrealism</ENAMEX>, and all the breakaway <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">factions</ENAMEX> and reactions which followed them. The great <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">innovators</ENAMEX> are all here: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matisse</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Picasso</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kandinsky, Duchamps, Pollock, Rauschenberg</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis Bacon</ENAMEX>, as well as the sculptors <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brancusi, Arp, Tinguely, Giacometti</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Claes Oldenburg</ENAMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mus√©e de l‚</ENAMEX>ÄôOrangerie
A <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pavilion</ENAMEX> in the corner of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jardins des Tuileries</ENAMEX> is home to the outstanding <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Walther-Guillaume Collection</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monet‚</ENAMEX>Äôs renowned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nymph√©as</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Water Lilies</ENAMEX>).

For his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">great</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nymph√</ENAMEX>©as murals, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monet</ENAMEX> himself chose the two ground-level oval <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> as those most likely to recapture the experience of coming across the water <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">lily ponds</ENAMEX> at his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Giverny</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">76</NUMEX>).

Not the least of the attractions are the artist‚Äôs letters, photo albums, bullfight tickets, and holiday postcards.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mus√©e National du Moyen Age</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mus√©e de Cluny</ENAMEX>)
The wonderful setting alone is worth the visit: an old abbey incorporating the massive remains of the city‚Äôs <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">third-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">baths</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thermes de Cluny</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the exhibits is older still: the fragments of a monument to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Jupiter</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">first century</TIMEX> a.d.) discovered near <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Notre-Dame</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twenty-one</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heads</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Notre-Dame‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">kings</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judah</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX>), some retaining traces of their original pigmentation (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1220</TIMEX>), were found in a bank <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">vault</ENAMEX> and brought here. But the museum‚Äôs most celebrated treasures are the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late 15th-century</TIMEX> tapestries, especially <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lady</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unicorn</ENAMEX>, depicting the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> senses and the temptations she vows to overcome.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parc de la Villette</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cit√© des Sciences</ENAMEX>
If there‚Äôs one thing this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX> dislikes, it‚Äôs being called a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>. First, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parc de la Villette</ENAMEX> offers a range of activities, and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>, it puts the accent firmly on participation. But as with any good <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>, you can learn a lot and enjoy yourself too. There‚Äôs something for all ages, and for anyone ready to be excited by the world of science.
The main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> has a lot in common with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beaubourg</ENAMEX>, although this one is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> times bigger. A variety of themes are explored: space, health, communications, agriculture, etc. Some of the hands-on displays are fun, but sometimes <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> is needed to follow all the information presented.
The sizeable stainless-steel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G√</ENAMEX>©ode sphere, made of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">6,433</NUMEX> reflecting triangles, houses a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cinema</ENAMEX> with a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">360¬∞</NUMEX> movie screen <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">36 m</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">118 ft</ENAMEX>) in diameter. As you watch the film, you feel as if you‚Äôre part of it. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">There‚Äôs</ENAMEX> also a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX>-seat <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">space</ENAMEX>-flight <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">simulator</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principal</ENAMEX> exhibition area, the planetarium and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">aquarium</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">submarine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Argonaute</ENAMEX> are covered by the entry fee (or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum Pass</ENAMEX>), but all other activities¬†‚Äî¬†even the creative play areas for young <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">children¬†‚Äî¬†cost</ENAMEX> extra (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">75</NUMEX>).
A <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canal</ENAMEX> passes right through the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>, so you can reach <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">La Villette</ENAMEX> by¬†boat from central <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a three-hour</TIMEX> trip; see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX>). The nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cit√© de la Musique</ENAMEX>, on the other side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canal</ENAMEX>, has a new concert <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX>, the ultra-modern <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conservatoire National</ENAMEX> (music <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">academy</ENAMEX>), and an impressively large rock venue, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Z√©nith.</ENAMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> is at its liveliest in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX>, when music festivals and the popular <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cin√</ENAMEX>©ma en <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plein Air</ENAMEX> (outdoor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cinema</ENAMEX>) take place. You can obtain a complete schedule of events from the tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Champs-Elys√©es.</ENAMEX>
Excursions
Chartres
The sublime silhouette of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Chartres Cathedral</ENAMEX>, inaugurated around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1200</TIMEX>, is visible from far away, towering above the old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> and the surrounding plain. Its medieval stained glass, including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> fine rose windows, is of unrivaled complexity and stunning beauty. Climb to the roof for an extraordinary view of the carved stone <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tracery</ENAMEX> and flying buttresses.

Fontainebleau
The forest here¬<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">†‚Äî¬†and the charming adjoining town¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†are every bit as popular as the great ch√¢teau. The latter was a royal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> for much longer than <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Versailles</ENAMEX>, with certain additions made over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven centuries</TIMEX>, notably from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Fran√ßois I</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16th century</TIMEX>. The old hunting forest, cool and shaded even in the hottest <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX>, is perfect for gentle walks, cycle rides, picnics, even rock-climbing.

Giverny
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Claude Monet‚</ENAMEX>Äôs glorious floral and water gardens are much more attractive than the rather artificially restored <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painter</ENAMEX> lived at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giverny</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1883 to 1926</TIMEX> and painted the gardens many times, especially the water lilies.

The best time to go is in the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early morning</TIMEX> (to beat the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowds</ENAMEX>) during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the spring</TIMEX> (for the most impressive flower displays).
Malmaison
Set in lovely grounds, the ch√¢teau used to be the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">home</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Napol√</ENAMEX>©on‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Josephine</ENAMEX>, who continued to live here after their divorce.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Vaux-le</ENAMEX>-Vicomte
A splendid <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ch√¢teau</ENAMEX> and gardens designed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Le Vau</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Le N√¥tre</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Le Brun</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Louis XIV‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">finance minister</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fouquet</ENAMEX>. No sooner was the magnificent project completed than the king, jealous of his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX>, had its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owner</ENAMEX> arrested for embezzlement and jailed for life.
Situated <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">56 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">35 miles</NUMEX>) southeast of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the N5</TIMEX>, or by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gare de Lyon</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Melun</ENAMEX>, and then <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">taxi</ENAMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Versailles</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis XIV, the ‚ÄúSun King</ENAMEX>,‚Äù was quite simply a megalomaniac, but he also had extraordinary vision. He was wary of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> and its rabble (all too easily roused) and rising aristocracy (ever-demanding and arrogant). What better way to keep potential trouble-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">makers</ENAMEX> under his thumb than to coop them up at <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Versailles</ENAMEX>, and let them squabble for rights and privileges as futile as attending His <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Majesty‚</ENAMEX>Äôs awakening?
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Versailles</ENAMEX> is as extravagant, formidable, and vainglorious as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> himself. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis XIII</ENAMEX> had hoped to turn his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">favorite</ENAMEX> hunting ground into a modest retirement <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">home</ENAMEX>, but his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heir</ENAMEX> made it the center of a universe, proclaiming his own grandeur in an edifice of brick, marble, gilt, and crystal.
A visit to the ch√¢teau takes most or all of a day, entails a lot of walking, and shouldn‚Äôt be inflicted on young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>. Bus tours leave from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jardine des Tuileries</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rue</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Rivoli</ENAMEX> side but you may prefer to do things in your own time. Make an early start, travel by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RER</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">103</NUMEX>), and you can fit in a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> tour of part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX>. Stroll through the gardens, have <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">lunch</TIMEX> beside the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Grand Canal</ENAMEX> (a packed lunch allows you to avoid <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Versailles‚Äô</ENAMEX> tourist traps), and take <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> in the grounds of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Petit Trianon</ENAMEX>. Finally, end <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">your day</TIMEX> by wandering back across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace gardens</ENAMEX> for a last view of the ch√¢teau at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">sunset</ENAMEX>.
The central section of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> is where the royal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> lived. Conceived by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis Le Vau</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jules Hardouin-Mansart</ENAMEX>, and landscape <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andr√© Le N√¥tre</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1661</TIMEX>, it was completed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21 years later</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Le Vau</ENAMEX> also designed the marble <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX>, decorated with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">84</TIMEX> marble busts.
Highlights of the vast interior include the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Royal Chapel</ENAMEX>, a gem of high <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baroque</ENAMEX>; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Apartments</ENAMEX>, in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Louis XIV</ENAMEX> used to entertain; the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Salon de Diane</ENAMEX>, where he would try his hand at billiards; and the glittering <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hall of Mirrors</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Galerie des Glaces</ENAMEX>), <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">73 m</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">240 ft</ENAMEX>) long and built to catch the setting sun in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> tall, arched panels of mirrors. Adjoining it is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">King‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedroom</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis</ENAMEX> died of gangrene of the leg in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1715</TIMEX>. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Queen‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedroom</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> royal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> were born, the births often attended by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX>, as was the custom. Several parts of the ch√¢teau, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Louis XV‚</ENAMEX>Äôs superb <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Opera</ENAMEX>, have to be visited on separate guided tours.
The most impressive fa√ßade faces west, to the gardens; the pretty fountains begin to play at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3:30pm</TIMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three Sundays a month</TIMEX>, from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September</TIMEX>. You should also look at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Grand Trianon</ENAMEX>, the small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Louis XIV</ENAMEX> used on¬†occasions when he wanted to get away from the ch√¢teau. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Petit Trianon</ENAMEX>, favored by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Louis XV</ENAMEX>, and the marvelous <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hameau</ENAMEX> (little village) and miniature <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">farm</ENAMEX> where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marie-Antoinette</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">queen</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Louis XVI</ENAMEX>, famously played at the simple life are also worth a visit. They‚Äôre some way from the ch√¢teau and each other; a little train runs a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">shuttle</ENAMEX> service at a price.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Versailles</ENAMEX> is situated <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">24 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">15 miles</NUMEX>) southwest of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX>, by <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">N10</NUMEX>); or by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Gare St-Lazare to Versailles</ENAMEX>; or by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RER</ENAMEX> (line <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">C5</NUMEX>) to <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Versailles-Rive Gauche</ENAMEX>; or by m√©tro to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pont de S√®vres</ENAMEX>, then bus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">171</NUMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Disneyland Paris Resort</ENAMEX>
Much more than a theme <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Disney‚</ENAMEX>Äôs ambitious recreation <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> also encompasses <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX>, camping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">convention center</ENAMEX>, a championship <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">golf course</ENAMEX>, tennis <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courts</ENAMEX>, and several swimming <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pools</ENAMEX>.
