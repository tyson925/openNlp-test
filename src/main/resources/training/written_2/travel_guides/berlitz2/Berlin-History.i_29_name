A Brief History
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> became a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">municipality</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1200s</TIMEX>, ironically as a divided <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">those days</TIMEX> the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> rival <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">halves</NUMEX> were in no rush to unite. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fishermen</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C√∂lln</ENAMEX>, whose name survives in the modern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">borough</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Neuk√∂lln</ENAMEX>, lived on an island in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">River Spree</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">townships</ENAMEX> that comprise the modern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mitte district</ENAMEX> grew up around market places over which the people‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nikolaikirche</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marienkirche</ENAMEX>, still tower <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>. With the fortress of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Burg K√∂penick</ENAMEX> providing a common defense to the south, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C√∂lln</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX> formed a trade <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">center</ENAMEX> between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Magdeburg</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Poznan</ENAMEX>.
In a region inhabited by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slavonic Sorbs</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> was overwhelmingly <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 13th century</TIMEX>, comprising enterprising <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">merchants</ENAMEX> hailing from the northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rhineland</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Westphalia</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lower Saxony</ENAMEX>, with latecomers from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thuringia</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harz</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C√∂lln</ENAMEX> came together in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1307</TIMEX> in order to lead the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Brandenburg</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">region‚Äôs defenses</ENAMEX> and defeat the robber <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">barons</ENAMEX> who were terrorizing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">merchants</ENAMEX> and local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peasants</ENAMEX>. The prosperous <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> joined the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hanseatic League</ENAMEX>, trading in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rye</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wool</ENAMEX>, and oak <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">timber</ENAMEX> and providing an entrep√¥t for skins and furs from eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. Apparently living was easy in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 15th century</TIMEX>, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">historian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trithemius</ENAMEX> noted: <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">‚ÄúLife</ENAMEX> here consists of nothing but eating and drinking.‚Äù
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX> continued as a virtually autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outpost</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX> until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1448</TIMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brandenburg‚Äôs Kurf√ºrst</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prince Elector) Friedrich II</ENAMEX> took over control of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> after crushing the citizens‚Äô violent resistance, the so-called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berliner</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Unwillen</ENAMEX>. He was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hohenzollern</ENAMEX> dynasty that was to hold sway here for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">over 450 years</TIMEX>.
The independent spirit of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Berliners</ENAMEX> was felt during the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reformation</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16th century</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> were tired of paying the tribute exacted by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catholic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1539</TIMEX>, at a time when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> of the other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principalities</ENAMEX> had to observe the religion of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prince</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berliners</ENAMEX> were successful in pressuring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prince</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elector Joachim II</ENAMEX> to accept the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Protestant</ENAMEX> creed as preached by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin Luther</ENAMEX>.
Like the rest of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> was devastated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Thirty Years‚Äô War</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1618‚Äì1648</ENAMEX>). Its <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Brandenburg</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rulers</ENAMEX> tried to befriend both the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Protestant</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catholic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">armies</ENAMEX> but made <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enemies</ENAMEX> of both, leaving unfortified <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX> to pay the price.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prussia¬†‚Äî¬†and Napoleon</ENAMEX>
With his ambition of uniting the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brandenburg</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Prussia</ENAMEX>, it was the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Great Elector Friedrich Wilhelm</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1640‚Äì1688</ENAMEX>) who prepared <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX> to become a strong capital, and fortified it as a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garrison</ENAMEX> town. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">newcomers</ENAMEX> were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> wealthy <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> who had been expelled from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vienna</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1671</TIMEX>. Then <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14 years later</TIMEX> 5,600 <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Huguenot</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Protestants</ENAMEX> arrived after being driven out of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> by the revocation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Edict of Nantes</ENAMEX>. At a time when <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> was considered the cultural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">master</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, these sophisticated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">merchants</ENAMEX> and highly skilled <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">craftsmen¬</ENAMEX>†‚Äî¬†among them <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">jewelers</ENAMEX>, tailors, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chefs</ENAMEX>, and restaurant-owners¬†‚Äî¬†brought a new refinement to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>.
This was further enhanced by the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Great Elector‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX>, who in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1701</TIMEX> crowned himself in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">K√∂nigsberg</ENAMEX> (now <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kaliningrad</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">King Friedrich</ENAMEX> in (not of) <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Prussia</ENAMEX>. Prompted by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sophie Charlotte</ENAMEX>, his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX> founded academies for the arts and sciences in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX>. Baroque <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">master</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andreas Schl√ºter</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48</NUMEX>) was commissioned to redesign the royal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX>, which was knocked down in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1951</TIMEX> to make way for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">East Germany‚Äôs Palast</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">der</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Republik</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sophie Charlotte‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX>, the grand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schlo√ü Charlottenburg</ENAMEX>, has survived as a model of the era‚Äôs elegance.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Friedrich Wilhelm</ENAMEX> I (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1713‚Äì1740</ENAMEX>) despised the baroque glitter of his parents‚Äô <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX>, and subjected the previously easy-going <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Berliners</ENAMEX> to a frugal, rigid concept of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Preussentum</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prussianness</ENAMEX>), that is, unquestioning obedience to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ruler</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">administrators</ENAMEX>, and sharply defined class distinctions, affirming the supremacy of the aristocracy and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> class and that of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX> over <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> in general.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Friedrich der Gro√üe</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frederick the Great</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1740‚Äì1786</NUMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King of</ENAMEX> (not just in) <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Prussia</ENAMEX>, took his realm to the forefront of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> politics and had little time for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX>. He concentrated on turning his beloved <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Potsdam</ENAMEX> into a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mini-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Versailles</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> was spoken and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Voltaire</ENAMEX> became his official <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">philosopher</ENAMEX>-in-residence. He rarely appeared in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX> except to garner public support¬<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">†‚Äî¬†and taxes¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†after his return from costly wars with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Silesians</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russians</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Austrians</ENAMEX>. He did, nevertheless, leave the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> capital an enduring legacy with the monumental <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Forum Fridericianum</ENAMEX> laid out on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Unter den Linden</ENAMEX> by his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">von Knobelsdorff</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">armies</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Frederick‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">successors</ENAMEX> proved to be no match for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Napoleon‚Äôs Grande Arm√©e</ENAMEX>, however, and as the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> advanced through eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1806</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Berlin‚Äôs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bureaucracy</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bourgeoisie</ENAMEX> fled to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. No <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> were left to defend the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> from its invaders, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Napoleon‚</ENAMEX>Äôs march through the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Brandenburg Gate</ENAMEX> into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX> kindled a new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">flame</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> patriotism.
Capital of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Germany</ENAMEX>
Defying the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two-year</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">occupation</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">philosopher</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johann Gottlieb Fichte</ENAMEX> exhorted the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to assume their rightful destiny as a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>. Drummers were ordered to drown out his fiery speeches at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Academy</ENAMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the uniting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nationalist</ENAMEX> movement after the defeat of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Napoleon</ENAMEX> were the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lesecaf√©s</ENAMEX> (reading caf√©s) such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spargnapani</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kranzler</ENAMEX>. They were a rendezvous for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intelligentsia</ENAMEX> who met to read foreign and provincial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX> and glean information withheld in the heavily censored <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX> press.
Meanwhile, the accelerating industrial revolution had produced a new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Berlin proletariat</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>. In the wake of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1848</TIMEX> revolts in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vienna</ENAMEX>, demonstrations which were held to protest working and living conditions in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX> were crushed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prussian</ENAMEX> cavalry, leaving <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">230</NUMEX> dead. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX> made small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concessions</ENAMEX>, paying lip service to the popular demand for press freedom and a constitutional monarchy. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A year later</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> controls had been tightened, press censorship resumed, and democratic meetings swarmed with government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spies</ENAMEX>.
Prussia‚Äôs success during the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Franco</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Prussian War</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1870‚Äì1871</ENAMEX>) placed it at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of a new united <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>. Under <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kaiser Wilhelm</ENAMEX> I and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Otto von Bismarck</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX> became the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reichshauptstadt</ENAMEX> (capital of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX>). By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1880</TIMEX>, amid the industrial expansion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gr√ºnderzeit</ENAMEX> (founding <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>), the city‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> soared past <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">the million</NUMEX> mark. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX> boomed as the center of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Germany‚Äôs</ENAMEX> machine industry and was a perfect market for mass-circulation <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX> and big department <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">KaDeWe</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kaufhaus des Westens</ENAMEX>), founded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1907</TIMEX>.
After that philistine period of rapid growth, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> at last began to assume its place as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Germany‚</ENAMEX>Äôs cultural as well as political capital, with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Max Liebermann</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lovis Corinth</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Max Slevogt</ENAMEX> challenging <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Munich‚</ENAMEX>Äôs dominance of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> painting. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Berlin Philharmonic</ENAMEX> asserted an international prestige, attracting <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tchaikovsky</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Strauss</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Grieg</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guest composers</ENAMEX>, and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1905</TIMEX>, the great <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Viennese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Max Reinhardt</ENAMEX> arrived to head the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deutsches Theater</ENAMEX>.
Among its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Koch</ENAMEX> won a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Nobel</ENAMEX> prize for his discovery of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Tuberculosis bacillus</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Max Planck</ENAMEX> headed the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kaiser Wilhelm Society for the Advancement of Science</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later</TIMEX> named the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Max-Planck-Institut</ENAMEX>), with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albert Einstein</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of the physics <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">War and Revolution</ENAMEX>
After years of opposition on social matters, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Berliners</ENAMEX> solidly supported what proved to be the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hohenzollerns‚Äô</ENAMEX> last military <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">gasp¬</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">†‚Äî¬†World War I.</ENAMEX> At the start of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hostilities</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 1914</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> gathered in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> to cheer the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kaiser</ENAMEX> at the royal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX>. The enthusiasm was short-lived.
Privations at home and the horrendous loss of life on the front turned popular feeling against the war. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1916</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karl Liebknecht</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosa Luxemburg</ENAMEX> formed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spartacus League</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Two years later</TIMEX>, with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> defeated and insurrections in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kiel</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Munich</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hamburg</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Stuttgart</ENAMEX>, revolution broke out in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX>. While the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Social Democrats</ENAMEX> were proclaiming a new <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">German Republic</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liebknecht</ENAMEX> took over the palace declaring the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Republic</ENAMEX> socialist, with ‚Äúsupreme authority for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX>.‚Äù
Vehemently opposed to any Soviet-style revolution, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chancellor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Friedrich Ebert</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Social Democrats</ENAMEX> outmaneuvered the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spartacists</ENAMEX>. The ruthless defense <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gustav Noske</ENAMEX> called in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Freikorps</ENAMEX> (right-wing storm-troopers) to smash the movement. They assassinated <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liebknecht</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Luxemburg</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15 January 1919</TIMEX>. (A plaque on the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">L√ºtzowufer</ENAMEX> marks the post where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosa Luxemburg‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> was fished out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Landwehr</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canal</ENAMEX>.) <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Four days later</TIMEX>, a new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Assembly</ENAMEX> was elected and the dominant <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Social Democrats</ENAMEX> moved the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> to the safety of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Weimar</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">240 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">150 miles</NUMEX>) southwest of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX>, to draw up the constitution of the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Republic</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crazy Twenties</ENAMEX>
The use of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Freikorps</ENAMEX> to suppress the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spartacists</ENAMEX> was to haunt the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Weimar Republic</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 1920</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kapp Putsch</ENAMEX> brought <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,000</NUMEX> of the storm-troopers into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX> with an obscure civil <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">servant</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolfgang Kapp</ENAMEX>, installed as puppet <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chancellor</ENAMEX>. The coup lasted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">only five days</TIMEX>, but set the tone for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Germany‚</ENAMEX>Äôs fragile experiment in parliamentary democracy. The swastika displayed on the helmets of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Freikorps</ENAMEX> was to reappear on the armbands of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hitler‚Äôs</ENAMEX> storm-troopers, crushing all democracy in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1933</TIMEX>.
The turbulent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenties</TIMEX> gave <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX> a special place in the world‚Äôs popular imagination. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1920</TIMEX>, the incorporation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">townships</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 60</NUMEX> suburban <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> into the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">metropolis</ENAMEX> effectively doubled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Berlin‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> overnight to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4 million</NUMEX>. Before democracy was extinguished in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1933</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> led a charmed life of exciting creativity that left its mark on the whole of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> culture. Defeat in <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War I</ENAMEX> had shattered the rigid certainties of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Berlin‚Äôs ‚ÄúPrussianness‚Äù</ENAMEX> and left the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> open to radical adventures in social and artistic expression almost unimaginable in the older cultural <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capitals</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vienna</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Artists</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">avant-garde intellectual</ENAMEX> movement known as Dada called for state prayers to be replaced by simultaneous poetry and regularization of sexual intercourse via a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central Dada Sex Office</ENAMEX>. Many <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> before the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> ‚Äúhappenings‚Äù of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin Dadaists</ENAMEX> were organizing races between a sewing machine and a typewriter, with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter Mehring</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Georg Grosz</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">jockeys</ENAMEX>.
In the meantime, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">nightclubs</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tauentzienstra√üe</ENAMEX> provided a combination of political satire and striptease, and sharp analysis of world affairs was accompanied by plenty of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocaine</ENAMEX>, and sexual license. The paintings of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Otto Dix</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Georg Grosz</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Max Beckmann</ENAMEX> were brutally realist, and the dissonance of the times was aptly captured by the atonal music composed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arnold Sch√∂nberg</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pupil</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alban Berg</ENAMEX>.
The conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">establishment</ENAMEX> winced when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prussian Writers‚Äô Academy</ENAMEX> chose as its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Heinrich Mann</ENAMEX>, the elder <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Mann</ENAMEX>, a violent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critic</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> bourgeoisie and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supporter</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Communist Party</ENAMEX>. His best-known novel, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Professor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Unrat</ENAMEX>, inspired <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Josef von Sternberg‚</ENAMEX>Äôs The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blue Angel</ENAMEX>, the film that revealed the vocal talents of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marlene Dietrich</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX> showed its sense of the times with its mastery of film, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 20th-century</TIMEX> art form. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fritz Lang</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">F.W. Murnau, G.W. Pabst</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ernst Lubitsch</ENAMEX> were the leading <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX> of their generation. While <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX> had considered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cinema</ENAMEX> to be principally an industry of mass entertainment, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">film-makers</ENAMEX> added a new perception of its artistic possibilities with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, Lulu, and Nosferatu</ENAMEX>. After seeing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fritz Lang‚</ENAMEX>Äôs premonitory fable of human regimentation, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Metropolis</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hitler</ENAMEX> wanted the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">master</ENAMEX> of the dark spectacle to make publicity films for him.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX> was going through a wild time, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Versailles</ENAMEX> peace treaty had laid heavy burdens on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>. At <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the start of the twenties</TIMEX>, inflation had made little more than nonsense of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> currency, and political assassinations became routine. The most significant of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> was <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreign minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walther Rathenau</ENAMEX>, an enlightened democrat and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jew</ENAMEX> who was killed near the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grunewald</ENAMEX> forest. It was also the time of vicious street battles between <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Communists</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Nazis</ENAMEX>, exploiting the social disruptions of inflation and unemployment that were impossible to ignore.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Third Reich</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Communist</ENAMEX> hostility towards the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Social Democrats</ENAMEX> split the opposition to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Nazis</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hitler</ENAMEX> became <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chancellor</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30 January 1933</TIMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Only a month later</TIMEX>, on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27 February</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reichstag</ENAMEX> went up in flames. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hitler</ENAMEX> used the fire as a pretext to eliminate <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Communist</ENAMEX> and all left-wing opposition from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> political life. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Nazi</ENAMEX> reign of terror had begun.
Flames were the leitmotiv of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Third Reich</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX>. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 May 1933</TIMEX>, a procession brought <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> along <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Unter den Linden</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Humboldt University</ENAMEX>. They carried books, not to a lecture but to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bonfire</ENAMEX> on which were burned the works of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Mann</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Heinrich Mann</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stefan Zweig</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albert Einstein</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sigmund Freud</ENAMEX>, as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Proust, Zola, Gide</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">H.G. Wells</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack London</ENAMEX>.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1936</TIMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">flame</ENAMEX> was brought from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX> to inaugurate the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Olympic Games</ENAMEX>, an attempt at <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Aryan</ENAMEX> propaganda which was soundly destroyed by black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">athlete</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesse Owens</ENAMEX>, who won <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> gold medals. In deference to foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>, all <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-Semitic</ENAMEX> signs such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Juden unerw√ºnscht</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> not wanted) were removed from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX>, and caf√©s. As soon as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreigners</ENAMEX> had left <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, the signs went up again.
Discrimination against <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> moved inexorably to <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the night</TIMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November 1938</TIMEX>, when synagogues and other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX>-owned <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> were burned. In the midst of the smashed glass of the looted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> wit eased the discomfort by referring to the event as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kristallnacht</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crystal Night</ENAMEX>). Berlin‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, which stood at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">170,000</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1933</TIMEX>, was reduced by emigration and extermination to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">around 6,000</NUMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1945</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX>
In the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">autumn of 1938</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hitler</ENAMEX> was put out that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berliners</ENAMEX> did not share his enthusiasm for the cavalcade of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> driving through the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX> was preparing its march into what used to be <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Czechoslovakia</ENAMEX>, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">onlookers</ENAMEX> shared none of the fervor that had greeted military parades in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1914</TIMEX>.
Their disquiet was shortly to be justified by the hail of bombs on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> attacks came in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1940</TIMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> in retaliation for the air raids on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX>. Attacks were stepped up after the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> defeat at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stalingrad</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1943</TIMEX>, with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglo-American ‚</ENAMEX>Äúcarpet-bombing.‚Äù The worst single raid was on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6 February 1945</TIMEX>, when bombs wiped out <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4 sq km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 1‚ÅÑ2 sq miles</NUMEX>) of the city <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one hour</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hitler</ENAMEX> spent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last days</TIMEX> of the war in his bunker at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reich</ENAMEX> chancellery. As <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> moved in to capture the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, he killed himself with a shot through the mouth.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">war</ENAMEX> ended with unconditional <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> surrender on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8 May 1945</TIMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> was left to pick up the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pieces¬†‚Äî¬†literally</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Women</ENAMEX> formed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tr√ºmmerfrauen</ENAMEX> (rubble <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>), with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60,000</NUMEX> of them passing the debris of war by hand to clear ground for rebuilding. Eventually there was sufficient rubble to create a few artificial mountains. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of them, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Teufelsberg</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grunewald</ENAMEX>, is big enough to ski on.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Division</ENAMEX> and Reunification
With the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX> already in place, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> entered <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1945</TIMEX> on their national <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Independence Day</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July</TIMEX>, followed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> and French contingents. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX>-power control of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX> was agreed at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Potsdam</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Winston Churchill</ENAMEX> (replaced in mid-conference by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clement Attlee</ENAMEX>, his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">successor</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prime Minister</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harry Truman</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Stalin</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> eastern sector covered <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">just under half the city‚Äôs</NUMEX> area. The western sector was divided among the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> in the north around <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Tegel Airport</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> mainly in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tiergarten</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spandau</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> in the sprawling southwest corner from Kreuzberg out to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grunewald</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wannsee</ENAMEX>.
Hard political realities soon developed from these administrative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">divisions</ENAMEX>, as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Allies</ENAMEX> found themselves confronted with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> efforts to incorporate the whole of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX> into a new <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Communist</ENAMEX>-controlled <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">German Democratic Republic</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1946</TIMEX> municipal elections¬<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">†‚Äî¬†Berlin‚Äôs</ENAMEX> first free vote since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1933</TIMEX>, and its last until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990¬†‚Äî¬</TIMEX>†the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Social Democrats</ENAMEX> won a crushing victory over the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Communists</ENAMEX>, prompting the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviets</ENAMEX> to tighten their grip on the eastern sector. Understandably unhappy that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Berlin‚</ENAMEX>Äôs capitalist presence in the middle of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East Germany</ENAMEX> was having a subversive influence on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Communist</ENAMEX> experiment, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviets</ENAMEX> and their <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">East German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">allies</ENAMEX> began to restrict traffic from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Germany</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 1948</TIMEX>, all road, rail, and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">waterway routes</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Berlin</ENAMEX> were sealed off. From <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Frankfurt</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hamburg</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hanover</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Western Allies</ENAMEX> countered the blockade by airlifting into <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Berlin</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">between 4,000 and 8,000 tons</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> and other vital supplies <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11 months</TIMEX>. The blockade finally ended in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 1949</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Berlin</ENAMEX> became a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Land</ENAMEX> linked administratively with, but thus far not politically incorporated into, the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Republic</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East Berlin</ENAMEX> was made capital of the fledgling <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">German Democratic Republic</ENAMEX>.
Discontent with the living conditions in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East Berlin</ENAMEX> first erupted into open revolt on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17 June 1953</TIMEX>. Striking construction <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> marched down <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stalinallee</ENAMEX> (which was later renamed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karl-Marx-Allee</ENAMEX>) and mounted violent demonstrations against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter Ulbricht</ENAMEX>. They were protesting against the state demands for increased productivity while their standard of living continued to compare unfavorably with that of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Berlin</ENAMEX>. The revolt was crushed by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">tanks</ENAMEX>.
By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the 1950s</TIMEX>, the flow of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">refugees</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West</ENAMEX> had reached disastrous proportions for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East Germany</ENAMEX>. Over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> had fled the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over half</NUMEX> of them through <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX>, where border controls were only perfunctory. When <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nikita Khrushchev</ENAMEX> decided to stop the hemorrhage, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> was losing <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">millions of marks</NUMEX> invested in the training of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineers</ENAMEX>, and other highly skilled <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> seeking better wages in the West.
In the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early hours</TIMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13 August 1961</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">East German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX> began to erect the wall that would separate <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Berlin</ENAMEX> and change the lives of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nearly 30 years</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wall</ENAMEX> started out as barbed wire and road <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">blocks</ENAMEX>, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">refugees</ENAMEX> continued to make their way through the barriers, by swimming through <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sewers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canals</ENAMEX> and jumping from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> and railway <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridges¬†‚Äî¬†risking</ENAMEX> life and limb for freedom and democracy. Soon, huge slabs of reinforced concrete and tank-traps formed a more impenetrable barrier. Crossing points were established for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreigners</ENAMEX> and for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">West Germans</ENAMEX>, but not for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Berliners</ENAMEX>, until a tiny few were allowed across much later in the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Cold War</ENAMEX> confrontation.
For the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Western Alliance</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Wall</ENAMEX> made <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Berlin</ENAMEX> an even more powerful propaganda symbol of democratic freedom. On his visit in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1963</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John F. Kennedy</ENAMEX> dramatically underlined the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Western Allies‚</ENAMEX>Äô commitment to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> with his famous proclamation: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>ÄúIch bin ein <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berliner</ENAMEX>.‚Äù
The erection of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wall</ENAMEX> did significantly reduce the flow of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">refugees</ENAMEX> to a few isolated escapes, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">East German</ENAMEX> economy suffered even more from the assaults of massive mismanagement and high-level corruption. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Erich Honecker‚Äôs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX> won international diplomatic recognition for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East Berlin</ENAMEX> as its capital and, with gleaming <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> and skyscrapers, tried to give it a lustre to rival <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Berlin</ENAMEX>. Beneath the surface, however, the drabness of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> life and lack of personal freedom continued to undermine any chance of popular support.
The final push which led to the collapse of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Berlin Wall</ENAMEX> came when an ecological campaign in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Leipzig</ENAMEX> against nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX> and industrial pollution grew into nationwide pressure for democratic freedom. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX>, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">East Germans</ENAMEX> fleeing to the West via <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hungary</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Czechoslovakia</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> was swept up in the wave of eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">revolutions</ENAMEX> unleashed by the reforms of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mikhail Gorbachev</ENAMEX>. His visit to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East Berlin</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 1989</TIMEX> for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">40th</NUMEX> anniversary of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">German Democratic Republic</ENAMEX> left it clear that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> would no longer shore up its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Berlin Wall</ENAMEX> was opened on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9 November 1989</TIMEX>, and at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midnight</TIMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 October 1990</TIMEX>, a huge black, red, and gold national flag was hoisted at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reichstag</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Berlin</ENAMEX> were again one.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">City Today</ENAMEX>
With a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 1990</TIMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost 3 1‚ÅÑ2 million</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX> was far and away <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Germany‚</ENAMEX>Äôs largest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> and quickly declared the national capital again. International <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">businessmen</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bankers</ENAMEX> flocked into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, but <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bonn</ENAMEX>, understandably, as well as many provincial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> opposing too great a concentration of power in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX>, were reluctant to see all the affairs of government desert the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rhine</ENAMEX>. Turning its back on its left-wing tradition, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> elected in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX> a conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mayor</ENAMEX> to cope with the enormous day-to-day problems in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">housing</ENAMEX>, employment, and transport arising from reunification.
On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20 June 1991</TIMEX>, the city‚Äôs role at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">hub</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> life was assured when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bundestag</ENAMEX> voted by a slim majority to restore <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX> as the seat of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 1999</TIMEX> a federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> was elected at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reichstag</ENAMEX> and, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August that year</TIMEX>, government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX> again began to be conducted from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reichstag</ENAMEX> was transformed by the addition of a vast glass <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dome</ENAMEX>, designed by Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norman Foster</ENAMEX>, to symbolize that the new <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> keeps no secrets from its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX> continued its transformation in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year 2000</TIMEX>, as new foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">embassies</ENAMEX> were erected, many in their pre-<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">War</ENAMEX> locations, and old ones refurbished, in preparation for increased foreign diplomatic representation in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany‚Äôs</ENAMEX> capital. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">The 21st century</TIMEX> will no doubt continue to see <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> playing a determining role in the shaping of a new <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>.
