A Brief history
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Puerto Ricans</ENAMEX>
The island‚Äôs earliest known <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhabitants</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indians</ENAMEX> now called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Arca√≠cos (‚Äúthe ancients‚Äù</ENAMEX>), were primitive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fishermen</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">More than 2,000</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX> they were conquered by another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tribe</ENAMEX> called the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Igneri</ENAMEX> who had mastered farming and potterymaking. The final stage of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> advancement began while <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> was in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Middle Ages</TIMEX>: the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ta√≠no Indians</ENAMEX>, a peaceful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people native</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venezuela</ENAMEX>, traveled up through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lesser Antilles</ENAMEX> and settled the island they called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Borinqu√©n</ENAMEX>. They lived in thatched <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>, hunted and farmed, and worked <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ceramics</ENAMEX> and textiles with great skill. Several of their ceremonial ‚Äúball <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX>,‚Äù which were used for certain social or religious gatherings, have been discovered throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ta√≠nos</ENAMEX> feared an evil spirit, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jurac√°n</ENAMEX>, who was responsible for violent storms and gave his name to the tropical hurricanes of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">West Indies</ENAMEX>. They also feared an earthly evil: the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carib Indians</ENAMEX>, who periodically raided their land for loot and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">captives</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ta√≠nos‚Äô</ENAMEX> fears were well founded. The word ‚Äúcannibal‚Äù derives from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Carib</ENAMEX>, a reminder of the way these marauders disposed of some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prisoners</ENAMEX>.
The Arrival of the Europeans
On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19 November 1493</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Columbus</ENAMEX> was lucky enough to be met by the kindly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ta√≠nos</ENAMEX> (in fact, the name <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ta√≠no meant ‚Äúfriend‚Äù</ENAMEX> and was used by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indians</ENAMEX> to enable the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Europeans</ENAMEX> to distinguish between them and the not-so-friendly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caribs</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ta√</ENAMEX>≠nos were the ones who introduced the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tobacco</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">corn</ENAMEX> on the cob, and that archetypal <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX> mode of relaxation, the hammock.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Columbus</ENAMEX> christened the island <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Juan Bautista</ENAMEX> (honoring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. John the Baptist</ENAMEX>). It was the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> colonist, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Juan Ponce de Le√≥n</ENAMEX>, who, admiring a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bay</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">north coast</ENAMEX>, declared it <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX> (‚Äúrich port‚Äù). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sixteenth-century</ENAMEX> mapmakers back in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> mistakenly confused the names, so that in the end the port became <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Juan</ENAMEX> and the whole island was called a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúrich port‚Äù</ENAMEX>; once on the maps, the names stuck.
A less innocent error was an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> attempt to erase <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four centuries</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> history. After the conquest of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1898</TIMEX> the first <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX> ordered that the name be spelled <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Porto Rico</ENAMEX>. This semi-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> corruption didn‚Äôt last long. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nationalists</ENAMEX> still yearn for good old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Borinqu√©n</ENAMEX>, a name you‚Äôll see on many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bars</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ponce de Le√≥n</ENAMEX> had received permission to found a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX> on the island in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1508</TIMEX>. For reasons of security, he settled <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a few miles</NUMEX> inland from what is now <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Juan</ENAMEX>. The site was swampy and mosquito-ridden, and, after a number of outbreaks of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, his fellow <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">colonists</ENAMEX> abandoned him and moved to the future <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital city</ENAMEX>. They immediately began work on the formidable fortifications for which the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> is still famous. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ponce de Le√≥n</ENAMEX> also suffered another setback. He became involved in a power struggle with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbus‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Diego</ENAMEX>, who through his father‚Äôs will had claims on the island. The small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX> could not cope with the egos of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> such powerful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> crown solved the tense standoff by entrusting <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ponce de Le√≥n</ENAMEX> with another voyage of exploration. His search resulted in the discovery of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX>. While on a second expedition to colonize <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1521</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ponce de Le√≥n</ENAMEX> was critically wounded during an attack by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indians</ENAMEX>; the explorer hoped to return <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX> but lost his fight for life on the way back, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Havana</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ponce de Le√≥n‚</ENAMEX>Äôs successors imagined that the island was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> big gold mine and set the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indians</ENAMEX> to work mining and panning. They were wrong, however: the gold soon ran out. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spaniards</ENAMEX> then looked to agriculture to turn a profit and began growing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sugar cane</ENAMEX>, which had been introduced to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbus‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> journey. As the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ta√≠no</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carib</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">laborers</ENAMEX> declined, due to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> and suicide, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plantation</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> eventually began importing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">slaves</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Africa</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX> quickly developed into a major port and trading post¬<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">†‚Äî¬†it</ENAMEX> was one of the last major <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ports</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">galleons</ENAMEX> stopped in before sailing back to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">motherland</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Juan</ENAMEX> also became the center for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catholic Church‚</ENAMEX>Äôs evangelization of the New World; numerous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX>, convents, and monasteries were established throughout the island to aid in this effort.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Beleaguered Island</ENAMEX>
To the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pirates</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">privateers</ENAMEX> who sailed the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 16th century</TIMEX>, the fortress of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Morro</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Juan</ENAMEX> represented the might, and the wealth, of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crown</ENAMEX>. Lured by the promise of treasure galleons and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ammunition</ENAMEX>, some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pirates</ENAMEX> worked independently; others, however, were employed by the various <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> crowns, particularly the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX>, to help carry on their power struggles in the colonial world. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX> suffered from constant attacks. The most poignant, though not typical, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">case</ENAMEX> involved raids against the coastal <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">hamlet</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Germ√°n</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pirate ships</ENAMEX> first ravaged the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1528</TIMEX>. It happened again in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1538</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the following five years</TIMEX>. After every attack the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">settlers</ENAMEX> put out the fires, buried the dead, and rebuilt <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Germ√°n</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1554</TIMEX>, after the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">sixth</NUMEX> sacking, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">settlers</ENAMEX> decided to move inland to the town‚Äôs present hilltop location. With remarkable persistence the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pirates</ENAMEX> climbed all the way, twice, just to pillage <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Germ√°n</ENAMEX>.
More ominous than the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> were the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> of Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis Drake</ENAMEX>. The great <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">navigator</ENAMEX> and adventurer operated in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> before he turned his attention to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1595</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drake</ENAMEX> learned that a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2-million</NUMEX>-peso gold shipment had just arrived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Juan</ENAMEX> aboard a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">galleon</ENAMEX>. This kind of booty was worth a battle, even though <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drake</ENAMEX> knew the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> was well protected by a set of forts. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">fleet</ENAMEX> dueled with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">El Morro fort</ENAMEX> and the defending <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">warships</ENAMEX> in a long, costly battle. Then, under cover of darkness, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drake</ENAMEX> sent out attack <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> to destroy the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">frigates</ENAMEX>. But light from the burning <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX> gave <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Morro‚Äôs</ENAMEX> shore batteries a fine view of their target. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> slunk away without the loot. It was the only defeat of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drake‚</ENAMEX>Äôs career; within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> he was dead.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Morro</ENAMEX> was not, however, invulnerable. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A few years later</TIMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">fleet</ENAMEX> commanded by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Clifford</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Earl</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cumberland</ENAMEX>, shrewdly outflanked the fortress. Far outnumbered by the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,700</NUMEX>-man invasion <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defenders</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Morro</ENAMEX> surrendered after a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two-week</TIMEX> siege. But the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> flag did not fly over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Juan</ENAMEX> for long. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four hundred</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cumberland‚Äôs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> died in an epidemic of yellow fever and dysentery, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> had to withdraw <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">less than three months</TIMEX> after their victory. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> were the next to try: in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1625</TIMEX>, they succeeded in pinning the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> into the confines of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Morro</ENAMEX>; but after looting everything of value, they set fire to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Juan</ENAMEX> and departed. Because surrender was never considered, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish¬†‚Äî¬†and today‚Äôs Puerto Ricans¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†regard this episode as a victory.
Soon after this, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> began building a thick defensive wall all around <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Juan</ENAMEX>. With an average height of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">40 feet</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX>), it was a formidable site, and is still one of the most impressive parts of the old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. It seems to have impressed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX> of marauders; once it was complete, they stayed away for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than 150 years</TIMEX>.
A final <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> rally against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX> came in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1797</TIMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Seven thousand</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> under Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ralph Abercromby</ENAMEX> landed east of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Juan</ENAMEX> and blockaded the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks</TIMEX> the battle see-sawed. Finally, as suddenly and unexpectedly as they had arrived, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> retired. According to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> version, it was all because of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. Ursula</ENAMEX> and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Virgins</ENAMEX>. On <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the last night</TIMEX> of the siege, devout local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, led by their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bishop</ENAMEX>, marched through the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> of old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Juan</ENAMEX> in a torchlight parade praying for deliverance. The legend says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Abercromby</ENAMEX> heard the church bells tolling, saw the lights, mistakenly deduced that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reinforcements</ENAMEX> had arrived, and fled.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">End of Spanish Rule</ENAMEX>
For <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th century</TIMEX> was a bitter slide from imperial might to the status of a has-been. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1800s</TIMEX> independence movements had overthrown <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> rule in most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Western Hemisphere</ENAMEX>. Madrid‚Äôs most important remaining <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">possessions</ENAMEX> were the island <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies of Cuba</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX>, both of which were chafing under the yoke of colonial rule and the bitter system of slavery. To squash subversive ideas about independence in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX> imposed ruthless <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">military</ENAMEX> control. The most memorable incident occurred in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1868</TIMEX> in the mountain <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lares</ENAMEX>, when government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> crushed an uprising of secessionists, killing or jailing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">insurgents</ENAMEX>, and many innocent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX>. The event is remembered as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">El Grito de Lares</ENAMEX> (the cry of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lares</ENAMEX>).
The colonial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> could not, however, hold back the tide of change sweeping the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1872</TIMEX>, one momentous decree abolished <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 350-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX> of slavery in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX>, and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1897</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> cut the colonial ties and finally granted the island autonomy. The long dream of independence seemed to have come true. But <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eight months</TIMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX> had authorized home rule for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> arrived to take it away.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">War</ENAMEX> was no great challenge for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> that landed at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gu√°nica</ENAMEX>, on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Rico‚</ENAMEX>Äôs calm south coast, rather than at fortified <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Juan</ENAMEX>. Military <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> was spotty at best. By starting at the soft underbelly, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">General</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nelson A. Miles</ENAMEX> gained control of the island in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">less than three weeks</TIMEX>. The central issue that had drawn <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> into <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">war¬†‚Äî¬†Cuba‚Äôs</ENAMEX> struggle for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">independence¬†‚Äî¬†was</ENAMEX> resolved in that island‚Äôs favor: Cuba‚Äôs freedom was guaranteed by the Paris <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Treaty of 1898</ENAMEX>. But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spain‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> other major <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philippines</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX>, simply changed hands, becoming <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> was initially little better off under its new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">landlord</ENAMEX>. Most <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Puerto Ricans</ENAMEX> were tied to the large agricultural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">companies¬†‚Äî¬†they</ENAMEX> lived in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company houses</ENAMEX> and were paid in tokens that could only be spent at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company stores</ENAMEX>. They didn‚<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Äôt starve</ENAMEX>, but they didn‚Äôt thrive, either. A few strong voices were eventually raised: some proposed radical action while others advocated working within the system for a more democratic society. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> especially prominent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activist</ENAMEX> was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mu√±oz Mar√≠n Rivera</ENAMEX>, who is credited with helping to move <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX> toward <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 20th century</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> gradually began to grant <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Ricans</ENAMEX> a greater degree of self-government and representation. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1900</TIMEX> the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> civil <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX> was appointed (all the appointed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governors</ENAMEX> were <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1946</TIMEX>). In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1917</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Ricans</ENAMEX> won a mixed bag of benefits: they were given more say in their internal affairs, made <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States¬†‚Äî¬†and</ENAMEX> declared eligible for conscription in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World War‚ÄÇI.</ENAMEX> In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</TIMEX> between the World Wars there were continued efforts to change the island‚Äôs status and improve its quality of life. Some, such as those who followed radical <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pedro Albizu Campos</ENAMEX>, took to violence, which resulted in several assassinations, though many more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">insurgents</ENAMEX> worked within the system.
More <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Puerto Rican draftees</ENAMEX> went to war in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1941</TIMEX>. Even while poverty lingered from the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Great Depression</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX> caused continued hardship on the island because of its isolation in a dangerous sea. But the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1940s</ENAMEX> saw the emergence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> great political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">figures</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mu√±oz Mar√≠n Rivera</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX> of the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Popular Democratic Party</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rexford Guy Tugwell</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Governor</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1941 to 1946</TIMEX>. These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> were instrumental in orchestrating an amazing economic expansion that almost single-handedly converted the island from an underdeveloped backwater into a pace-setting industrial society. Under ‚ÄúOperation <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bootstrap</ENAMEX>,‚Äù which attracted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factories</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX> through tax and other incentives, the per-capita income soared to the highest in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latin America</ENAMEX>. Life expectancy rose from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about 45 years</TIMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1940</TIMEX> to an enviable <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">71 years today</TIMEX>. Pouring <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one-third</NUMEX> of its entire budget into education, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX> cut illiteracy to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 10 percent</NUMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commonwealth of Puerto Rico</ENAMEX>
Politically, recent history is less conclusive. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1951</TIMEX> the island‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> approved a new constitution (still in effect) forming a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">commonwealth</ENAMEX> between the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> and the ‚Äúfree associated state‚Äù of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX> (though even the commencement ceremony was marred by violent demonstrations by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">radicals</ENAMEX>). As a result <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Ricans</ENAMEX> now elect their own <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX>,¬†legislature, and local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>, and send a non-voting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US Congress</ENAMEX>. In turn, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> runs the postal, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">customs</ENAMEX>, and immigration services, handles defense and foreign relations, and sends dollars¬†‚Äî¬†particularly useful in times of crisis, such as after hurricanes.
In recent elections, power has alternated between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> backing the status-quo and those preferring even closer ties with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, though a referendum in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX> defeated a move towards statehood. A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> is often in the news, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> pushing for independence¬†‚Äî¬†establishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX> as a separate nation¬†‚Äî¬†have thus far gained only minority support at the polls. The withdrawal of tax incentives for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> operating in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>, which has caused job losses and economic hardship, is another thorn in the side of those who hope for a stronger and more self-sufficient society. On the other hand, tourism, which began in earnest in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s</TIMEX>, brings increasing numbers of visitors¬†‚Äî¬†and amounts of money¬†‚Äî¬†to the island‚Äôs economy.
