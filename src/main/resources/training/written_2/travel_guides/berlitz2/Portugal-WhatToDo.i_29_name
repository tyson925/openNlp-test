WHAT TO DO
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SHOPPING</ENAMEX>
Though <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX> has grown considerably more modern and cosmopolitan over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last two decades</TIMEX>, it continues to excel at traditional crafts. Small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> and outdoor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">markets</ENAMEX> across the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> feature intricate works of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">silver</ENAMEX>, handpainted <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ceramics</ENAMEX>, and classic wool rugs. Other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shoppers</ENAMEX> will be pleased by the sprouting of chic fashion and jewelry <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boutiques</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lisbon</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Porto</ENAMEX>, as well as wine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> and cellars stocking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Portugal‚</ENAMEX>Äôs famous fortified <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wines</ENAMEX>. Relative to other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>, many consumer goods remain somewhat cheaper in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX>. 
What to Buy
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brass</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bronze</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">copper</ENAMEX>. Candlesticks, pots and pans, old-fashioned scales, bowls, and trays can be found across <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX>. Cataplanas make a delightful decorative or functional souvenir. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Moorish</ENAMEX> tradition of producing cooking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">utensils</ENAMEX> from beaten <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">metal</ENAMEX> is maintained in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Loul√©</ENAMEX>, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve</ENAMEX>. 
Carpets and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rugs</ENAMEX>. Attractive and excellently crafted hand-made rugs, mostly from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alentejo</ENAMEX> region, have been produced for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX>. Arraiolos <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wool rugs</ENAMEX> are colorful and rustic-looking; the small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of the same name has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a few dozen</NUMEX> small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX>. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ceramics</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pottery</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Azulejos</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Portugal</ENAMEX> is renowned for its colorful and hand-painted glazed pottery and tiles. You can buy a single blue-and-white tile, an address plaque for your <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>, or an entire set of plates. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> will paint tiles to order or copy a photograph. But remember that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ceramics</ENAMEX> can be heavy and fragile to carry <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX>; inquire about shipping options. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> has its own distinctive style, ranging from the intricately painted faience <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coimbra</ENAMEX> to the ubiquitous roosters of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barcelos</ENAMEX> and the black pottery of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chaves</ENAMEX>. Good places to buy include the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Azulejo Museum</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lisbon</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX>) and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> along route <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EN-125</ENAMEX> along the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Algarve coast</ENAMEX>, which sell more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ceramics</ENAMEX> and pottery than anywhere else in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX>. The small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Porches</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> standout <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Olaria Algarve</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Porches Pottery</ENAMEX>), which has revived and updated long-forgotten <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Moorish</ENAMEX> styles, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Casa Algarve</ENAMEX>. Coimbra‚Äôs old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> is a good place to find ceramics featuring revived 17th‚<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Äì18th-century</TIMEX> styles typical of the area. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cork</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Portugal</ENAMEX> is the world‚Äôs leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">producer</ENAMEX> of cork. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">You‚Äôll</ENAMEX> find place mats, intricate sculptures, and other designs, and it‚Äôs as light as a feather to take home.
Embroidery. A great many embroidered, items, including tablecloths and napkins, are all over <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Portugal¬†‚Äî¬†especially</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> markets. Look for the delicate hand needlework that comes from the island of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Madeira¬†‚Äî¬†items</ENAMEX> that are exceedingly well crafted but still comparatively inexpensive. 
Jewelry. Filigree work, a legacy of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moors</ENAMEX>, is of extremely high quality. Look for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">silver</ENAMEX> filigree earrings and brooches, often in the form of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">butterflies</ENAMEX>.
Leather. You can find a very good selection of fashionable, relatively inexpensive shoes and handbags. Leather belts, bags, and shoes are very popular buys. Shoes are just about as fashionable as in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX>, and are cheaper.
Music. To enjoy the sounds of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX> back home, take home a classic fado recording, perhaps by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Am√°lia Rodrigues</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carlos Paredes</ENAMEX>, or a disc of ethereal <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> pop by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lisbon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madredeus</ENAMEX>.
Wine. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Portugal‚Äôs</ENAMEX> wine industry produces not only excellent table <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wines</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">D√£o</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Douro</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alentejo</ENAMEX>, but legendary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">port wine</ENAMEX>, which comes from the north. The best places to buy are the cellars maintained by all the major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">producers</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vila Nova de Gaia</ENAMEX> just across the river from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Porto</ENAMEX>. Given wine‚Äôs weight and bulk, it‚Äôs often best to wait until the duty-free <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX>.
When <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">& Where to Shop</ENAMEX>
Most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> are open at least <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monday‚ÄìFriday</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">9am‚Äì1pm</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3‚Äì7pm</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday 9am‚Äì1pm</TIMEX>. Modern shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">malls</ENAMEX> are usually open <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10am‚Äìmidnight</TIMEX> or later, and often on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> as well. Increasingly, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> also stay open during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">lunchtime</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">Country markets</ENAMEX> start business around <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">8am</ENAMEX> and run through <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">mid-afternoon</TIMEX>.
Street markets (feiras or mercados) are fun for their atmosphere, and the goods for sale include all kinds of crafts, clothing, and food items. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lisbon</ENAMEX>, behind <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S√£o Vicente de Fora</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Feira da Ladra (‚ÄúThieves‚Äô Market‚Äù</ENAMEX>) is held on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barcelos</ENAMEX> holds the country‚Äôs largest <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekly</TIMEX> market. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Craft Fair</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vila</ENAMEX> do <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conde</ENAMEX>, near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Porto</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August</TIMEX>), and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Craft Fair</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lagoa</ENAMEX>, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August</TIMEX>), both display crafts from all over the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>.
Major credit cards are accepted in almost all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>, but less so in the smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX>. Prices are generally fixed, except in markets. 
Entertainment
Nighttime entertainment options differ greatly depending on where you are. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lisbon</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Porto</ENAMEX> offer all kinds of live music, theater, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clubs</ENAMEX>, and resorts along the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve</ENAMEX> are well-stocked with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bars</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">discos</ENAMEX>. Smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> tend to be much quieter.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fado</ENAMEX>. The classic night out in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lisbon</ENAMEX> still belongs to the fado clubs (casas de fado) in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alfama</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bairro Alto</ENAMEX>. Many offer dinner as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drinks</ENAMEX>. Fado‚Äôs origins are unclear; it may have developed as a form of mourning for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> lost at sea or it may be a relic of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the days</TIMEX> of slavery¬†‚Äî¬†a kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Iberian blues</ENAMEX>. Typically a fado <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">troupe</ENAMEX> consists of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> dressed appropriately in black accompanied by a couple of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> playing acoustic guitars. The music is a swell of longing, regret, and nostalgia. You may also hear a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> perform the same sort of ballad with a strong, husky voice. The fado is much too solemn to be danced, so regional fishermen‚Äôs and shepherds‚Äô dances are sometimes performed to perk things up.
Lisbon <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clubs</ENAMEX> to consider include: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adega Machado</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rua do Norte</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">91</NUMEX>); A <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Parreirinha da Alfama</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beco do Esp√</ENAMEX>≠rito <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santa</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>); A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Severa</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rua das G√°veas</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">51</NUMEX>); and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Senyor Vinho</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rua do Meio √† Lapa</ENAMEX>). 
Along the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve</ENAMEX>, you‚Äôll also find ‚Äúfado nights‚Äù at bars and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX>. The quality of performances is unlikely to rival the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clubs</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lisbon</ENAMEX>, but you can still get a taste for this quintessentially <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Portuguese</ENAMEX> musical expression. 
Other <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Live Music and Performing Arts</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lisbon</ENAMEX> is home to the greatest number of opera, ballet, and classical concerts (including the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gulbenkian Symphony</ENAMEX>). Lisbon‚Äôs cultural scene offers occasional opera, symphony concerts, ballet, and recitals, usually held in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX>. The city‚Äôs opera <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> is highly regarded by the rest of the world, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gulbenkian Foundation</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX>) maintains its own symphony <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">orchestra</ENAMEX> and ballet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Porto</ENAMEX> (selected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European City of Culture</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>) is certainly on the upswing, featuring a wide spate of concerts and theater that will likely improve the city‚Äôs offerings on a permanent basis. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nightclubs</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lisbon</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Porto</ENAMEX> are both packed with dance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clubs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bars</ENAMEX> that go late into <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the night</TIMEX>, and popular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Albufeira</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Praia da Rocha</ENAMEX> throb to a disco beat. Most other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX>, while offering a reduced roster of low-key bars, tend to be rather quiet at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>.
Gambling. Near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lisbon</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Estoril Casino</ENAMEX> is one of the biggest draws for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gamblers</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Casinos</ENAMEX> are also found in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monte Gordo, Vilamoura</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Praia da Rocha</ENAMEX>, as well as at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Figuera da Foz</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Espinho</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P√≥voa de Varzim</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Popular</ENAMEX> games are baccarat, craps, roulette, blackjack, and slot machines. To be admitted, you must be over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> and carry a passport.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SPORTS</ENAMEX>
From swimming and hiking to the challenge of deep-sea fishing, sports <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enthusiasts</ENAMEX> have plenty of options in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX>. The temperate climate in the south also means year-round <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">golf and tennis</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Water Sports</ENAMEX>
Diving and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Snorkeling</ENAMEX>. There are some <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three dozen</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> along <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Portugal‚</ENAMEX>Äôs long southern coastline that cater to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">divers</ENAMEX>. It is especially popular in the western <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Algarve</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Luz</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lagos</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sagres</ENAMEX>. Along the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Estoril Coast</ENAMEX> and just off <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sesimbra</ENAMEX>, south of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lisbon</ENAMEX>, the extraordinarily clear, calm <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX> are good for snorkeling and scuba diving.
Fishing. All along the coast you will see anglers in boots casting off from the beaches, and others perched on rocks or man-made promontories. A permit is needed for river and lake fishing; details are available from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branches</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Portuguese National Tourist Office</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">169</NUMEX>) or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Instituto Florestal</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avenida Jo√£o Cris√≥stomo</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26, 1000</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lisbon</ENAMEX>). Angling conditions are generally best in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the winter</TIMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-January</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Boats</ENAMEX> can be rented in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portim√£o</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Faro, Sesimbra</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Set√∫bal</ENAMEX> along the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the best deep-sea fishing spots is around <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sesimbra</ENAMEX>, known for its swordfish. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Algarve</ENAMEX> provide some of the best big-game fishing in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sailing</ENAMEX> and boating. Most beaches protected from the open ocean have rowboats, canoes, or pedalos for rent by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the hour</TIMEX>. Experienced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sailors</ENAMEX> in search of a more seaworthy <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">craft</ENAMEX> should ask at the local yacht harbor. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve</ENAMEX>, dinghies and sailing instruction are available at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Praia de Luz</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quinta do Lago</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Portim√£o.</ENAMEX> For bigger craft try the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">marina</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vilamoura</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carvoeiro Club</ENAMEX>. Boat <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cruises</ENAMEX> are available in virtually every settlement along the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve</ENAMEX>.
Swimming. With great beaches all round the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> coast, opportunities for swimming could not be better. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve</ENAMEX> has warmer <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> and more sheltered beaches than the west coast. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lifeguards</ENAMEX> are not common. Most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> have swimming <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pools</ENAMEX>. Because of pollution along the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Estoril Coast</ENAMEX>, you should not swim any closer to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lisbon</ENAMEX> than at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Estoril</ENAMEX> itself, which has been granted an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX> blue flag (for safe conditions). 
Land <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sports</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">Golf</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Portugal</ENAMEX> has emerged as one of the world‚Äôs top destinations for golfing vacations, with many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> offering all-inclusive vacations. There are top <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX> around <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lisbon</ENAMEX> (especially <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Estoril</ENAMEX>) and a few near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Porto</ENAMEX>, but it is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve</ENAMEX> which has the lion‚Äôs share (including some of the finest courses in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>). Particularly notable are those at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vilamoura</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quinta do Lago</ENAMEX>. Request the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sportugal Golfing</ENAMEX> brochure from a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Portuguese National Tourist Office</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">169</NUMEX>) or pick up a copy of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve Golf Guide</ENAMEX>, with information on all of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX> and pro playing tips. Avid <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">golfers</ENAMEX> should also consider the option of accommodations at a ‚ÄúGolf <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hotel</ENAMEX>.‚Äù Typically these are establishments very close to the top golf <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX> that offer free (or heavily discounted) golf on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX> that may otherwise be difficult to get a game on. They also arrange golf tournaments among their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guests</ENAMEX>.
Green fees range from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">9,000 to 19,000 esc</NUMEX>. for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> holes. All courses are open to visitors; many require an official handicap certificate, and all require proper dress. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Horseback</ENAMEX> riding. There are stables all around the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> where <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX> can be hired, and many quintas (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> on country estates) provide <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guests</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve</ENAMEX> in particular has a number of riding <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX>, or centros h√≠picos. Most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses you‚Äôll encounter</ENAMEX> are at least part <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lusitano</ENAMEX>, a famous and sure-footed <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">breed</ENAMEX>. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">Tennis</ENAMEX>. Major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> tend to have their own tennis <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courts</ENAMEX>, but there are tennis <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">clubs</ENAMEX> and public <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX> as well. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">golf clubs</ENAMEX> also have their own <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve</ENAMEX> is home to several world-class tennis <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers¬†‚Äî¬†one</ENAMEX> of the most impressive is at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vale do Lobo</ENAMEX>. Another famous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> is run by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Lloyd</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clube de T√</ENAMEX>©nis <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rocha Brava</ENAMEX> near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Carvoeiro</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Estoril Tennis Club</ENAMEX> is another excellent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">center</ENAMEX>.
Walking. The many national <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX> in central and northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX> are ideal for walking and hiking: The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Serra da Estrela</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Peneda-Ger√™s</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montesinho National Parks</ENAMEX> are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of the best. The beaches and cliffs along the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Algarve coast</ENAMEX> are also excellent for walking, as are the mountains of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Serra do Monchique</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Tr√°s-Os-Montes</ENAMEX>. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spectator Sports</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bullfights</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Portuguese bullfights</ENAMEX> differ from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> version in one crucial respect: The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bull</ENAMEX> is not killed in the ring, but later in a slaughterhouse. 
Portugal‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> of bullfighting is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vila Franca de Xira</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">49</NUMEX>) in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ribatejo</ENAMEX>. Fights are also staged in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campo Pequeno Pra√ßa de Touros</ENAMEX> bullring in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lisbon</ENAMEX> (beginning in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX> until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of September</TIMEX>, with bullfights presented every <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX>) and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Monumental</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">arena</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cascais</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Bullfights</ENAMEX> strictly organized for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> are held at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lagos</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Quarteira</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Vila Real de Santo Ant√≥nio</ENAMEX>, and Albufeira along the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Algarve coast</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the bullfighting season</TIMEX> (look for notices advertising <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚ÄúPra√ßa de Toiros‚Äù</ENAMEX>). 
The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX> runs from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Easter Sunday</ENAMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">Soccer (football</ENAMEX>). As in most <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>, fut√©bol draws big <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowds</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX>. Lisbon‚Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Benfica and Sporting Clube de Portugal</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FC Porto</ENAMEX> is the top <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">club</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal‚</ENAMEX>Äôs second <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Portugal for Children</ENAMEX>
The most popular destination for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> is likely to be the beach. Most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> also have pools, many with shallower <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pools</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>.
The beaches of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve</ENAMEX>, with long, sandy, gently shelving beaches for small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and small rocky coves ideal for older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> to explore, are perfect for family <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">holidays</TIMEX>. Pay attention to the beach warning flags, however. Green means the sea is calm and a lifeguard is on duty; green plus a checkered flag means that no lifeguard is on duty; yellow urges caution; red means danger and warns <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bathers</ENAMEX> to stay ashore.
The biggest new attraction in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lisbon</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parque das Na√ß√µes</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37</NUMEX>), with its splendid <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">aquarium</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ocean√°rio de Lisboa</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">playgrounds</ENAMEX>, fountains, paddleboats, and aerial cable <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX>.
