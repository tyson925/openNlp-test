What to Do
Entertainment
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> comes alive after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">dark</TIMEX> with a range of activities to fill your diary. However, youâ€™ll probably need to alter your normal routine to enjoy it as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locals</ENAMEX> do. Theater performances are followed by a late leisurely dinner, often after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11pm</TIMEX>, and if you intend to head out to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">nightclub</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donâ€™t</ENAMEX> expect to start until <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">around midnight</TIMEX>.
Even if you only want to sample the delights of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tavernas</ENAMEX> and perhaps stroll around <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Plaka</ENAMEX>, the real atmosphere starts after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9pm</TIMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> come out to eat. If you can hold your appetite that long youâ€™ll have a much more authentic experience. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Athenscope</ENAMEX> is a free <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publication</ENAMEX> that lists all activities taking place during the time of your stay, but here are the major forms of entertainment that you could enjoy.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Theater</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ancient</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greeks</ENAMEX> were credited with inventing drama and comedy in the theater, and this tradition carries on into the present. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> boasts around <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">theaters</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the season</TIMEX> is a popular one lasting from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX>. Most of the performances are in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Athens Festival</ENAMEX> runs from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September</TIMEX> with a full program of cultural events ranging from choral concerts to dance to recitals with performances aimed at <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Athenians</ENAMEX>. For details of the program contact the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Tourist Board</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Odos Voukourestiou 1</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tel</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">01</NUMEX>-9694500.
The following <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">theaters stage</ENAMEX> performances for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX>, or performances that would appeal to international <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audiences</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">National Theater and Concert Hall</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tel</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">01-7282333</NUMEX>, more commonly known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Megaron</ENAMEX>, is situated on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vas</ENAMEX>. Sofias, next to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Megaro Mousikis Metro</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">station</ENAMEX>. It has a program of new and established works in addition to choral, opera, and other musical performances by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> and international <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">musicians</ENAMEX> and dance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roman Odeon of Herodes Atticus</ENAMEX> near the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acropolis</ENAMEX> holds classical performances on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> evenings.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lycabettus Theater</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mount Lycabettus</ENAMEX> also holds regular <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> performances but is less likely to be internationally oriented.

Sound and <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Light Show</ENAMEX>: The history of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acropolis</ENAMEX> is brought to life through dancing lights and an informative narration, and the surrounding darkness really allows you to study the beauty of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parthenon</ENAMEX>. This is a must for all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>. Performances take place <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nightly May</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9pm</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tel</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">01-3225904</NUMEX> for details.
Traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Music and Dance</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX> has a rich legacy of folk dance and music, though genuine performances are becoming more difficult to find, particularly in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dora Stratou Folk Dance Theater</ENAMEX> presents performances of traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> song, dance, and music at a traditional â€œfolk-villageâ€-type auditorium on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Philopappos Hill</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">SeptemberÂ â€”Â daily</ENAMEX> except <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Mondays</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tel</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">01-3244395</NUMEX> for ticketing details and prices.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inter</ENAMEX>-island cruising
Take a trip to one of the islands of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Saronic Gulf</ENAMEX> where you can enjoy the laid-back atmosphere of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX>, and the fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">airÂ â€”Â a</ENAMEX> total contrast to the bustle and noise of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. Have a long lunch at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the many <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tavernasÂ â€”Â the seafood</ENAMEX> is great<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">!â€‚â€”Â and</ENAMEX> do a little shopping before returning to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> on the late ferry. See excursions in the Where to Go section for some ideas.
Sports
The proximity of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> to the coast offers a great opportunity to combine beach activities with a city vacation. Traveling by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">taxi</ENAMEX> from a downtown <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX>, it only takes <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 minutes</TIMEX> to find some excellent <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX>. Much of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> closes down during the heat of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August</TIMEX> (though not those relating to tourism) and many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> head to the coast for the cooler air, therefore you find the resorts very busy at this time. The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX> is short, with many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> opening in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX> and closing again in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September</TIMEX>. The closest resort to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GlyfÃ¡da</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only 12 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">7 miles</NUMEX>) from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. Its proximity to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> makes it extremely busy, especially on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekends</TIMEX> and it lies very close to the approach to the old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX>, which in the past resulted in a lot of aircraft noise. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twenty</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kilometers</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">12 miles</NUMEX>) away is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VoÃºla</ENAMEX>, a little less crowded than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GlyfÃ¡da.</ENAMEX> VouliagmÃ©ni is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 miles</NUMEX>) further south, and a haunt for the local <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">jet</ENAMEX>-set because of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">spa situated</ENAMEX> at the sulphur lake that gives the resort its name. For more details about <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">spa</ENAMEX> treatments, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tel</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">01-8960341</NUMEX>. There are a number of luxury <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> situated here. Each of these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX> has a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tourist Boardâ€“approved</ENAMEX> beach with changing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX>, and watersports. There is a small entrance fee.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Youâ€™ll</ENAMEX> find a full range of sports offered: from <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">tennis</ENAMEX>, windsurfing, and waterskiing to snorkeling and divingÂ â€”Â however it is fair to say that the underwater world so close to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> can be disappointing.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saronic</ENAMEX> islands have a longer seasonÂ<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL"> â€”Â stretching</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aegina</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spetses</ENAMEX> are particularly well-organized with regard to watersports and beach activities, but if you want to relax on the beach it may be better to spend <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">at least one night</TIMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spetses</ENAMEX> as it is a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two hour</TIMEX> boat trip from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Piraeus</ENAMEX>.
For those whose <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> hotel doesnâ€™t have a pool the following <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> allow non-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guests</ENAMEX> to enjoy the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> for an admission feeÂ<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT"> â€”Â the Athens Hilton 46</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vas, Sofias Ave</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tel</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">01-7720201</NUMEX>; and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caravel Hotel</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vas, Alexandras Ave</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tel</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">01</NUMEX>-7290731.
Other sports
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sailing</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Weekend</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> sailing is very popular with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Athenians</ENAMEX> as the crowded marinas such as those at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pireaus</ENAMEX> testify. Tournaments occur regularly throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX>, and even the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> have their own league competitions. Several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> have <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> to rentÂ<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT"> â€”Â with</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crew</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">â€œbareâ€</ENAMEX> if you have a skipperâ€™s certificate.

Fishing: You donâ€™t need to be a professional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">angler</ENAMEX> to enjoy a relaxing dayâ€™s fishing. Just about every male over the age of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> can be found sitting on the sea wall waiting for a bite and it is amazingly relaxing to be letting the rod do all the work. Or you can rent a small <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> out into deeper <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>. Contact the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amateur Anglers and Maritime Sports Club</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moutsopoulou Quay</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tel</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">01-4515731</NUMEX> for more details.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golf</ENAMEX>: There is an <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">18-hole</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">golf course</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GlyfÃ¡da</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tel</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">01</NUMEX>-9846820.

The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delphi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arachova</ENAMEX> lie <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">only twenty minutes</TIMEX> from the slopes if you want a village atmosphere. Contact the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alpine Club</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arachova</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tel</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">01-2324555</NUMEX> for more details.
As in any major <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> has sporting <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> in the form of private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clubs</ENAMEX> and community <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Olympic Athletic Center</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Odos Kifisias 37</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marousi</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tel</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">01-6834060</NUMEX>) has a range of excellent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> swimming <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pools</ENAMEX>, basketball <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX>, and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">velodromeÂ â€”Â all</ENAMEX> for use during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 2004</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Olympic Games</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spectator Sports</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">Football</ENAMEX> (soccer): <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Football</ENAMEX> is a national obsession for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greeks</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Athensâ</ENAMEX>€™ <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Panathanaikos</ENAMEX> and AEK <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX>) feature prominently in domestic and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> competitions. The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX> runs from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Panathanaikos Football Stadium</ENAMEX> is located at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kifissia</ENAMEX>, a northern <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">suburbÂ â€”Â this</ENAMEX> will be the major <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stadium</ENAMEX> for the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Olympic Games</ENAMEX>, which will be held in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. Ask your <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX> if it is possible to get tickets as these are difficult to come by.
Horseracing: <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> Race <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">course</ENAMEX> can be found at the bottom of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Syngrou Avenue</ENAMEX> where racing takes place on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Mondays</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesdays</TIMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturdays</TIMEX>. Plans have been drawn up to redevelop the course as part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Olympic</ENAMEX> program, so make enquiries with your <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EOT</ENAMEX> before making the journey out to the course.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shopping</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Athens</ENAMEX> offers a multitude of shopping opportunities, not only for typical <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>-style souvenirs, but for haute couture, good art, and jewelry. The good news is, whatever your budget, youâ€™re bound to find something exciting to take homeÂ â€”Â whether you want mass-produced items or unique hand-finished pieces. As with any large <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">districts</ENAMEX> specialize in certain types of goods, so here is a short rundown of what is available.
Where to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shop</ENAMEX>
For undeniably tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">kitsch</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plaka</ENAMEX> and youâ€™ll find mass-produced items of all kinds. They are interspersed with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">galleries</ENAMEX>, T-shirt <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, and numerous street <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hawkers</ENAMEX> selling fun toys or handmade budget art.
MonistirÃ¡ki is the old bazaar area of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cityâ€‚â€”â€‚the Sunday flea</ENAMEX> market is a must for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">collectors</ENAMEX> of old <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">china</ENAMEX>, memorabilia, and furnitureÂ â€”Â and the myriad small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> sell all kinds of collectibles in addition to good-value street clothing.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kolonaki</ENAMEX> is the favorite district of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Athenians</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boutiques</ENAMEX> and home furnishings <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> that sell the best of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> design. Prices match the quality here, but if you donâ€™t want to spend, just sit at a streetside cafÃ© and watch the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">jet</ENAMEX>-set do a little shopping.
The maze of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> around the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Cathedral</ENAMEX> offers religious souvenirs of all kinds. Incense <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">burners</ENAMEX>, icons, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">tamataÂ â€”Â votive offeringsÂ â€”Â</ENAMEX> are the most portable. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Athens Municipal Market</ENAMEX> just south of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Omonia Square</ENAMEX> offers wonderful fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> for you to enjoy as you stroll, as well as numerous <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foodstuffs</ENAMEX> to take home.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ermou, Eolou</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stadiou</ENAMEX> offer large department <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> and numerous <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">pan-European</ENAMEX> names with everything from shoes and clothing to household wares.
In many parts of the city prices are flexibleÂ â€”Â though not in department <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">boutiquesÂ â€”Â and haggling</ENAMEX> is expected at the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">flea</ENAMEX> market. In tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, you may get a discount for cash, and prices are lower early and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late in the season</TIMEX>. Conversely, you may be charged a little extra if you want to pay by credit card.
What to Buy
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Copper</ENAMEX> and brassware: <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Copper</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brass</ENAMEX> have been used for many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">household utensils</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX> and skilled <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">craftsmen</ENAMEX> still work in small workshops around the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. The newly produced goods have a bright patina that mellows with use, and some of the older <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pieces</ENAMEX> are exceptionally beautiful. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Antiques</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">MonastirÃ</ENAMEX>¡ki have the best choice and these include urns for carrying <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, samovars, bowls, and tureens. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ornate Ottoman</ENAMEX> tables on folding wooden <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX> are compact enough to carry in hand luggage, as are serving ladles and goat bells.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ceramics</ENAMEX>: The skills honed at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Kerameikï¿½ï¿½s</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries ago</TIMEX> are still much in evidence on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX>. You can buy exquisite hand-thrown and painted copies of ancient pieces for a price, and numerous examples of less expensive <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factory</ENAMEX> produced items. Traditional shapes of urns, jugs, and cups are decorated with scenes taken from the lives of the ancients or of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gods</ENAMEX> in their domain on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mount Olympus</ENAMEX>. Modern ceramic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> also thrive and there are many small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">galleries</ENAMEX> showcasing hand created pieces. 
Statuary: If you want a little piece of ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX> then youâ€™ll certainly be able to find it. It will be a reproduction of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">courseÂ â€”â€‚but</ENAMEX> still you can own your own copy of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zeus, Poseidon</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Athena</ENAMEX> herself, small enough to grace a table or large enough to decorate a garden. Plaques depicting ancient friezes, or masks to hang on walls are also extremely popular, as are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mycenaean</ENAMEX> helmets. If classical statuary is too ornate for your taste, you can also find copies of the minimalist Mycenaean statues found at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goulandris Museum</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Archaeological Museum</ENAMEX> also has a wide range of copies of its artifacts. Each comes with a certificate of authentication.
Leatherware: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Local</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">craftsmen</ENAMEX> have always worked goat and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cow hides</ENAMEX> and the industry continues <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Footwear</ENAMEX>, bags, and clothing come in a range of styles, though quality is generally more rustic and bohemian than similar items produced in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>. 
Carpets and needlepoint: <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottoman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">craftsmen</ENAMEX> left behind a legacy in both the use and production of fine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carpetsÂ â€”Â look</ENAMEX> for hand-knotted ornate patterns in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wool</ENAMEX> or silk which come with a hefty price tag. Hand-produced <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> flotaki rugs were traditionally used in farmhouses across the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> world and are made from sheep <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wool</ENAMEX>. They are sold by weight and are decorated with traditional symbols such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">deer</ENAMEX>, or patterns, such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mycenaean</ENAMEX> geometric designs. 
Needlepoint, crochet, and embroideryÂ â€”Â once activities undertaken by every <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">womanÂ â€”Â are</ENAMEX> now dying arts, so any hand-crafted pieces will become collectorsâ€™ items of the future. Machine-produced pieces are readily available in the form of tablecloths, napkins, cushions, and handkerchiefs. Or you could try a traditional embroidered hat complete with long silk tassel, now only worn during folkloric spectacles.
Jewelry: When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schliemann</ENAMEX> excavated the tombs of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mycenaean</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rulers</ENAMEX> he found their skulls decorated with masks fashioned from pure <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX>. Since that time <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX> has been famed for the worksmanship of this most precious <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">metal</ENAMEX> and you can still find many high class jewelry <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> producing excellent quality items. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Athenians</ENAMEX> still love to adorn themselves as they did in ancient times with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX>, and with precious <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stones</ENAMEX> imported from elsewhere. Prices are very competitive as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX> is sold by weight with a relatively small mark-up for the craftsmanâ€™s skill, however always check with prices at home if you intend to make a major purchase. Most popular items are traditional patterns passed down since ancient times. The major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX> also sell copies of items displayed, which are quite appropriate souvenirs of your trip.
For those whose taste or budget isnâ€™t for precious metals and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stones</ENAMEX>, there is a whole range of jewelry featuring semi-precious <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stones</ENAMEX> and street jewelry such as rings, earrings, toe rings, and though not strictly jewelry, worry <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">beadsÂ â€”Â carried</ENAMEX> by most <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> to calm the nervesÂ â€”Â are very decorative. The best feature beads of cornelian or amber with silver decoration and silk thread.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Icons</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Art</ENAMEX>: An icon is a religious portrait, usually of a saint or apostle. These were a development from the fayum paintings that covered the face of the dead in the sarcophagi of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Egyptian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mummies</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Icons</ENAMEX> lie at the heart of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Byzantine or Orthodox</ENAMEX> worship in both the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX>, and they form a focus for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">prayerÂ â€”Â the characteristic gold</ENAMEX> leaf used in their production symbolized the glory of God. 
For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX> they were popular souvenirs of the grand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Tour</ENAMEX> or religious pilgrimage. However, modern production methods, including thin artificial canvas and gaudy synthetic colors, saw them lose favor.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX> there has been a rebirth in icon painting using traditional methods, both for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> renovations, and for commercial sale. Natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pigments</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">egg tempura</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">egg</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">yolk</ENAMEX> and vinegar) binding are painstakingly mixed and applied to a canvas bound over <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wood</ENAMEX>. The gold leaf is then applied and the whole image is given a patina. This time-consuming work is exquisite and correspondingly expensive. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Pre-1821</ENAMEX> icons will require an export permit.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Youâ€™ll</ENAMEX> find mass-produced icons in many tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, but for quality pieces visit a specialist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX>.
Icons are a very particular form of art, and if they are not to your taste there is a whole range of art to choose from. Scenes of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> and the classical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> are extremely popular as mementos.
Edibles: <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Wonderful foods</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> countryside include <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">honey</ENAMEX>, olives and olive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX>, and nuts such as almonds and hazelnuts. All can be bought in pretty packaging for you to take home. For something a little stronger try ouzoÂ<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL"> â€”Â the aniseed flavor aperitifÂ â€”Â</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">brandy</ENAMEX>, which is slightly sweeter than <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> Cognac. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metaxa</ENAMEX> is the most famous brand name. 
Things to Do with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Children</ENAMEX>
Athens requires some forethought if you are taking young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>. Not all will be as eager to spend <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> at the ruins and it can be oppressively hot during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer months</TIMEX>. However, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greeks</ENAMEX> love <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and they will be most welcome and fussed over in tavernas and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, which makes eating out a delight.
Here are some ideas for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>-friendly visit:
Take a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> trip to one of the nearby islands. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metro</ENAMEX> ride to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pireaus</ENAMEX> means you only have to cross a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">highway</ENAMEX> to reach the ferry <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX>, and numerous destinations are <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only an hour or two</NUMEX> away. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Children</ENAMEX> will love the journey and the magic of reaching a seaside destination.
Take time out in the cool gardens of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">National Gardens</ENAMEX> have a lake with water <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">playground</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Areos Park</ENAMEX>, near the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Archaeological Museum</ENAMEX>, has play <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>.
Let your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> have their portraits doneÂ â€”Â street <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> can be found in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">PlakaÂ â€”Â</ENAMEX> or their faces painted. Either way they get to be the center of attention.
If all else fails, a day at the beach will surely blow the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> cobwebs away. Take a break at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GlyfÃ¡da</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VoÃºla</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">VouliagmÃ©niÂ â€”Â only</ENAMEX> a short taxi ride away.
