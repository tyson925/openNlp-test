What to Do
Entertainment
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> comes alive after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">dark</TIMEX> with a range of activities to fill your diary. However, you‚Äôll probably need to alter your normal routine to enjoy it as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locals</ENAMEX> do. Theater performances are followed by a late leisurely dinner, often after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11pm</TIMEX>, and if you intend to head out to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">nightclub</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">don‚Äôt</ENAMEX> expect to start until <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">around midnight</TIMEX>.
Even if you only want to sample the delights of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tavernas</ENAMEX> and perhaps stroll around <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Plaka</ENAMEX>, the real atmosphere starts after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9pm</TIMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> come out to eat. If you can hold your appetite that long you‚Äôll have a much more authentic experience. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Athenscope</ENAMEX> is a free <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publication</ENAMEX> that lists all activities taking place during the time of your stay, but here are the major forms of entertainment that you could enjoy.

The following <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">theaters stage</ENAMEX> performances for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX>, or performances that would appeal to international <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audiences</ENAMEX>.

Sports
The proximity of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> to the coast offers a great opportunity to combine beach activities with a city vacation. Traveling by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">taxi</ENAMEX> from a downtown <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX>, it only takes <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 minutes</TIMEX> to find some excellent <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX>. Much of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> closes down during the heat of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August</TIMEX> (though not those relating to tourism) and many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> head to the coast for the cooler air, therefore you find the resorts very busy at this time. The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX> is short, with many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> opening in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX> and closing again in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September</TIMEX>. The closest resort to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Glyf√°da</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only 12 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">7 miles</NUMEX>) from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. Its proximity to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> makes it extremely busy, especially on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekends</TIMEX> and it lies very close to the approach to the old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX>, which in the past resulted in a lot of aircraft noise. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twenty</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kilometers</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">12 miles</NUMEX>) away is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vo√∫la</ENAMEX>, a little less crowded than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Glyf√°da.</ENAMEX> Vouliagm√©ni is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 miles</NUMEX>) further south, and a haunt for the local <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">jet</ENAMEX>-set because of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">spa situated</ENAMEX> at the sulphur lake that gives the resort its name. For more details about <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">spa</ENAMEX> treatments, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tel</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">01-8960341</NUMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">You‚Äôll</ENAMEX> find a full range of sports offered: from <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">tennis</ENAMEX>, windsurfing, and waterskiing to snorkeling and diving¬†‚Äî¬†however it is fair to say that the underwater world so close to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> can be disappointing.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saronic</ENAMEX> islands have a longer season¬<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">†‚Äî¬†stretching</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aegina</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spetses</ENAMEX> are particularly well-organized with regard to watersports and beach activities, but if you want to relax on the beach it may be better to spend <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">at least one night</TIMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spetses</ENAMEX> as it is a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two hour</TIMEX> boat trip from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Piraeus</ENAMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spectator Sports</ENAMEX>

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shopping</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Athens</ENAMEX> offers a multitude of shopping opportunities, not only for typical <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>-style souvenirs, but for haute couture, good art, and jewelry. The good news is, whatever your budget, you‚Äôre bound to find something exciting to take home¬†‚Äî¬†whether you want mass-produced items or unique hand-finished pieces. As with any large <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">districts</ENAMEX> specialize in certain types of goods, so here is a short rundown of what is available.
Where to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shop</ENAMEX>
For undeniably tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">kitsch</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plaka</ENAMEX> and you‚Äôll find mass-produced items of all kinds.

Monistir√°ki is the old bazaar area of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">city‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthe Sunday flea</ENAMEX> market is a must for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">collectors</ENAMEX> of old <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">china</ENAMEX>, memorabilia, and furniture¬†‚Äî¬†and the myriad small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> sell all kinds of collectibles in addition to good-value street clothing.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kolonaki</ENAMEX> is the favorite district of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Athenians</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boutiques</ENAMEX> and home furnishings <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> that sell the best of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> design. Prices match the quality here, but if you don‚Äôt want to spend, just sit at a streetside caf√© and watch the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">jet</ENAMEX>-set do a little shopping.
The maze of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> around the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Cathedral</ENAMEX> offers religious souvenirs of all kinds. Incense <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">burners</ENAMEX>, icons, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">tamata¬†‚Äî¬†votive offerings¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†are the most portable. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Athens Municipal Market</ENAMEX> just south of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Omonia Square</ENAMEX> offers wonderful fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> for you to enjoy as you stroll, as well as numerous <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foodstuffs</ENAMEX> to take home.

In many parts of the city prices are flexible¬†‚Äî¬†though not in department <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">boutiques¬†‚Äî¬†and haggling</ENAMEX> is expected at the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">flea</ENAMEX> market.

Conversely, you may be charged a little extra if you want to pay by credit card.
What to Buy
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Copper</ENAMEX> and brassware: <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Copper</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brass</ENAMEX> have been used for many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">household utensils</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX> and skilled <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">craftsmen</ENAMEX> still work in small workshops around the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. The newly produced goods have a bright patina that mellows with use, and some of the older <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pieces</ENAMEX> are exceptionally beautiful. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Antiques</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Monastir√</ENAMEX>°ki have the best choice and these include urns for carrying <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, samovars, bowls, and tureens. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ornate Ottoman</ENAMEX> tables on folding wooden <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX> are compact enough to carry in hand luggage, as are serving ladles and goat bells.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ceramics</ENAMEX>: The skills honed at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">KerameikÔøΩÔøΩs</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries ago</TIMEX> are still much in evidence on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX>. You can buy exquisite hand-thrown and painted copies of ancient pieces for a price, and numerous examples of less expensive <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factory</ENAMEX> produced items. Traditional shapes of urns, jugs, and cups are decorated with scenes taken from the lives of the ancients or of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gods</ENAMEX> in their domain on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mount Olympus</ENAMEX>. Modern ceramic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> also thrive and there are many small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">galleries</ENAMEX> showcasing hand created pieces. 
Statuary: If you want a little piece of ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX> then you‚Äôll certainly be able to find it. It will be a reproduction of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">course¬†‚Äî‚ÄÇbut</ENAMEX> still you can own your own copy of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zeus, Poseidon</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Athena</ENAMEX> herself, small enough to grace a table or large enough to decorate a garden. Plaques depicting ancient friezes, or masks to hang on walls are also extremely popular, as are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mycenaean</ENAMEX> helmets. If classical statuary is too ornate for your taste, you can also find copies of the minimalist Mycenaean statues found at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goulandris Museum</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Archaeological Museum</ENAMEX> also has a wide range of copies of its artifacts. Each comes with a certificate of authentication.
Leatherware: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Local</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">craftsmen</ENAMEX> have always worked goat and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cow hides</ENAMEX> and the industry continues <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Footwear</ENAMEX>, bags, and clothing come in a range of styles, though quality is generally more rustic and bohemian than similar items produced in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>. 
Carpets and needlepoint: <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottoman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">craftsmen</ENAMEX> left behind a legacy in both the use and production of fine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carpets¬†‚Äî¬†look</ENAMEX> for hand-knotted ornate patterns in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wool</ENAMEX> or silk which come with a hefty price tag. Hand-produced <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> flotaki rugs were traditionally used in farmhouses across the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> world and are made from sheep <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wool</ENAMEX>. They are sold by weight and are decorated with traditional symbols such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">deer</ENAMEX>, or patterns, such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mycenaean</ENAMEX> geometric designs. 
Needlepoint, crochet, and embroidery¬†‚Äî¬†once activities undertaken by every <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">woman¬†‚Äî¬†are</ENAMEX> now dying arts, so any hand-crafted pieces will become collectors‚Äô items of the future. Machine-produced pieces are readily available in the form of tablecloths, napkins, cushions, and handkerchiefs. Or you could try a traditional embroidered hat complete with long silk tassel, now only worn during folkloric spectacles.
Jewelry: When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schliemann</ENAMEX> excavated the tombs of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mycenaean</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rulers</ENAMEX> he found their skulls decorated with masks fashioned from pure <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX>. Since that time <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX> has been famed for the worksmanship of this most precious <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">metal</ENAMEX> and you can still find many high class jewelry <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> producing excellent quality items. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Athenians</ENAMEX> still love to adorn themselves as they did in ancient times with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX>, and with precious <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stones</ENAMEX> imported from elsewhere. Prices are very competitive as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX> is sold by weight with a relatively small mark-up for the craftsman‚Äôs skill, however always check with prices at home if you intend to make a major purchase. Most popular items are traditional patterns passed down since ancient times. The major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX> also sell copies of items displayed, which are quite appropriate souvenirs of your trip.
For those whose taste or budget isn‚Äôt for precious metals and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stones</ENAMEX>, there is a whole range of jewelry featuring semi-precious <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stones</ENAMEX> and street jewelry such as rings, earrings, toe rings, and though not strictly jewelry, worry <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">beads¬†‚Äî¬†carried</ENAMEX> by most <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> to calm the nerves¬†‚Äî¬†are very decorative. The best feature beads of cornelian or amber with silver decoration and silk thread.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Icons</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Art</ENAMEX>: An icon is a religious portrait, usually of a saint or apostle. These were a development from the fayum paintings that covered the face of the dead in the sarcophagi of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Egyptian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mummies</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Icons</ENAMEX> lie at the heart of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Byzantine or Orthodox</ENAMEX> worship in both the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX>, and they form a focus for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">prayer¬†‚Äî¬†the characteristic gold</ENAMEX> leaf used in their production symbolized the glory of God. 
For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX> they were popular souvenirs of the grand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Tour</ENAMEX> or religious pilgrimage. However, modern production methods, including thin artificial canvas and gaudy synthetic colors, saw them lose favor.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX> there has been a rebirth in icon painting using traditional methods, both for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> renovations, and for commercial sale. Natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pigments</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">egg tempura</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">egg</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">yolk</ENAMEX> and vinegar) binding are painstakingly mixed and applied to a canvas bound over <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wood</ENAMEX>. The gold leaf is then applied and the whole image is given a patina. This time-consuming work is exquisite and correspondingly expensive. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Pre-1821</ENAMEX> icons will require an export permit.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">You‚Äôll</ENAMEX> find mass-produced icons in many tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, but for quality pieces visit a specialist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX>.
Icons are a very particular form of art, and if they are not to your taste there is a whole range of art to choose from. Scenes of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> and the classical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> are extremely popular as mementos.
Edibles: <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Wonderful foods</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> countryside include <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">honey</ENAMEX>, olives and olive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX>, and nuts such as almonds and hazelnuts. All can be bought in pretty packaging for you to take home. For something a little stronger try ouzo¬<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">†‚Äî¬†the aniseed flavor aperitif¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†or <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">brandy</ENAMEX>, which is slightly sweeter than <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> Cognac. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metaxa</ENAMEX> is the most famous brand name. 
Things to Do with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Children</ENAMEX>
Athens requires some forethought if you are taking young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>. Not all will be as eager to spend <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> at the ruins and it can be oppressively hot during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer months</TIMEX>. However, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greeks</ENAMEX> love <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and they will be most welcome and fussed over in tavernas and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, which makes eating out a delight.
Here are some ideas for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>-friendly visit:
Take a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> trip to one of the nearby islands. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metro</ENAMEX> ride to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pireaus</ENAMEX> means you only have to cross a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">highway</ENAMEX> to reach the ferry <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX>, and numerous destinations are <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only an hour or two</NUMEX> away. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Children</ENAMEX> will love the journey and the magic of reaching a seaside destination.
Take time out in the cool gardens of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">National Gardens</ENAMEX> have a lake with water <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">playground</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Areos Park</ENAMEX>, near the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Archaeological Museum</ENAMEX>, has play <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>.
Let your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> have their portraits done¬†‚Äî¬†street <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> can be found in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Plaka¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†or their faces painted. Either way they get to be the center of attention.
If all else fails, a day at the beach will surely blow the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> cobwebs away. Take a break at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Glyf√°da</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vo√∫la</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Vouliagm√©ni¬†‚Äî¬†only</ENAMEX> a short taxi ride away.
