What to Do
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shopping</ENAMEX>
There‚Äôs nothing more fun after a day of culture and history than to indulge in a little shopping, and one of the great things about old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Juan</ENAMEX> is that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> and the history intertwine. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> are housed in distinguished <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> in the heart of the old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>. Old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Juan</ENAMEX> is an ideal place for browsing and comparison shopping¬†‚Äî¬†its small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arcades</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> are full of the familiar as well as the strange and exotic. Local handicrafts reflect a mix of traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> techniques and styles. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Children</ENAMEX> will easily be able to find something to buy with their few dollars pocket money, and, if your budget allows, you can spend <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> on a unique piece of art or sculpture. You will also find that many well-known brand names of popular items may be less expensive here than at home.
What to Buy
Here are some items to look for while exploring the island:
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Antiques</ENAMEX>. The many interesting antiques <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> here vouch for the authenticity of old <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Puerto Rican</ENAMEX> furniture, clocks, and bric-a-brac.
Art. The art scene is flourishing in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX>. Many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">galleries</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Juan</ENAMEX> exhibit the work of up-and-coming <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX>; some of the best <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">galleries</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> are to be found on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Calle Cruz</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Calle Cristo</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calle San Jos√©</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">You‚Äôll</ENAMEX> find work in all <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">media¬†‚Äî¬†oils</ENAMEX>, pastels, and gouache, as well as sculptures. Haitian <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pieces</ENAMEX> are also available in some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">galleries</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Old San Juan</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bamboo</ENAMEX>. Flutes, whistles, and other novelties carved from this locally grown hollow-stemmed <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> are available in crafts <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> throughout the island.
Children‚Äôs clothing. Very stylish togs for tots, including fancy wear from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>, are available here.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cigars</ENAMEX>. Locally grown <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tobacco</ENAMEX> is used in hand-rolled cigars (you can watch cigar-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">makers</ENAMEX> at work in various places in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Juan</ENAMEX>). Though more expensive than <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Dominican¬†‚Äî¬†the</ENAMEX> harvest here is small¬<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">†‚Äî¬†Puerto Rican cigars</ENAMEX> are said to be mild and full of flavor.
Designer goods. You can find the real thing in trendy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boutiques</ENAMEX>, or scour the markets for knock-offs of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">designer</ENAMEX> watches, bags, and clothing.
Evil-eye charms. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amulets</ENAMEX> and other trinkets, many hand-carved, are reminders of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> strain in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Puerto Rican</ENAMEX> culture.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fabrics</ENAMEX>. Hand-printed textiles in novel designs are a growing industry on the island.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guayaberas</ENAMEX>. The best-dressed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Puerto Rican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gentlemen</ENAMEX> wear these tailored, embroidered shirts for many occasions.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hammocks</ENAMEX>. The old <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> industry is still alive here. Hammocks come in a remarkable variety of styles, colors, and sizes (a miniature model for your <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>, a double-wide hammock for the adventurous).
Imported goods. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Window-shopping</ENAMEX> reveals surprises galore: <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Swiss</ENAMEX> watches, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">saris</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Balinese</ENAMEX> sarongs, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">crystal</ENAMEX>, and more.
Jewelry. From basic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">materials</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">shells</ENAMEX> and beads to chic expensive rings and brooches of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX> and precious <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stones</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kites</ENAMEX>. Buy them, then fly them; you won‚Äôt need to wait until you return home to enjoy this purchase.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lace</ENAMEX>. A once dying art is being revived in mountain <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> in the west. It‚Äôs pretty, but extremely pricey.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macram√©.</ENAMEX> A booming cottage industry. Popular items made from knotted threads or cords include <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">framed ‚Äúscenes‚Äù</ENAMEX> or useful objects like coasters.
Musical instruments. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Puerto</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Rican</ENAMEX> style marimbas, xylophones, or other instruments make interesting and sometimes inexpensive souvenirs. Some are made from dried gourd or calabash. Some are filled with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seeds</ENAMEX> for shaking (maracas), others notched on the outside for rhythmical scraping (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">g√ºiro</ENAMEX>).
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Na√Øve Amerindian</ENAMEX> images. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stone</ENAMEX> carvings of bats, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">turtles</ENAMEX>, and monkeys transformed onto T-shirts or wall prints.
Outlet goods. Some of the best known names in retailing have <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> in the old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, where you‚Äôre sure to find a bargain.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pavas</ENAMEX>. Straw hats worn by every <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">j√≠baro</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Rum</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Puerto Rican</ENAMEX> brands of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">rum¬†‚Äî¬†light</ENAMEX>, dark, and aged¬†‚Äî¬†are best-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sellers</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Don Q</ENAMEX> is the best-known <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Puerto Rican brand</ENAMEX> (named after <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Don Quixote</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hero</ENAMEX> of the distillery‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX>), but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bacardi</ENAMEX> now calls <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX> home (after leaving <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX> at the time of the revolution) and is by far the biggest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">producer</ENAMEX>. Other labels to try are <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barrilito</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Palo Viejo</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Ron Rico</ENAMEX>. Prices are much cheaper in duty-free <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">St.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas</ENAMEX>, if you‚Äôre planning a side trip.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Santos</ENAMEX>. These hand-carved statuettes of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">saints</ENAMEX> or religious scenes are eminently portable. You‚Äôll be able to choose from the na√Øve to the sophisticated.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Voodoo</ENAMEX> dolls and masks. Serious or whimsical, grotesque or just exotic. You may have a chance to see some used in a <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">fiesta parade</ENAMEX>.
Wooden bowls and plates. Most of these items are fashioned from native <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>.
Zoological figurines. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Turtles</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">elephants</ENAMEX>, giraffes, and, most prevalent, images of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Rico‚</ENAMEX>Äôs beloved <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree frog</ENAMEX>, the coqu√≠.
Entertainment
Music
Music is the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ingredient</ENAMEX> that keeps this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> moving, and, whatever their age, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Ricans</ENAMEX> cannot help but dance to any beat they hear. The popular rhythms are a unique mixture of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">African</ENAMEX> influences, though the instruments traditionally used have antecedents going back further than the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> colonial and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">slave</ENAMEX> imports. The g√ºiro, a percussion instrument made of a notched dried gourd, was developed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ta√≠no Indians</ENAMEX>. To this the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> added several types of guitars, with the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX>-stringed cuatro being the most famous¬†‚Äî¬†it is the national instrument of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> slaves brought with them the wherewithal to produce tambours, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wood</ENAMEX> covered in animal skin to create drums, and maracas, dried gourds filled with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seeds</ENAMEX>. These instruments played together form the basic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">‚Äúorchestra‚Äù</ENAMEX> for several popular musical genres.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Puerto Rican</ENAMEX> folk music is rich with songs based on real-life issues faced by the j√≠baros, the ordinary country <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folk</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">island¬†‚Äî¬†death</ENAMEX>, unrequited love, and poverty resulting from bad harvests. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salsa</ENAMEX> is probably the most famous form of music to emerge from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX>. Ironically, salsa (which means ‚Äúsauce‚Äù) was imported back to the island from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Puerto Rican community</ENAMEX> who settled in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 1940s</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Salsa</ENAMEX> combines an array of percussion instruments with a swinging horn section. You will hear it everywhere. A much older <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚ÄúLatin‚Äù</ENAMEX> dance making a comeback is the merengue, which, when it first became popular, was considered to be so provocative that it was banned by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX>.
Finally, there are the compelling bomba and the plena. A genre directly related to the rhythmic beats of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> music, bomba makes use of animal-skin drums along with maracas and higher pitched percussion instruments. Plena music is said to have its roots in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> colonial courtly behavior, though the instruments used are also Ta√≠no and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX>. Most of the stage shows at the larger <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> features these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> types of music.
Theater
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Teatro Tapia</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tel</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">721-0169</ENAMEX>) in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Old San Juan</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Centro de Bellas Artes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tel</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">725-7337</ENAMEX>) in the suburb of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santurce</ENAMEX> hold regular performances that range from traditional ballet to classical theater to modern works by today‚Äôs most prodigious talents. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Teatro La Perla</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tel</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">843-4080</ENAMEX>) in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ponce</ENAMEX> also has a full card of performances, especially at festival time.
Casals <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Festival</ENAMEX>
The highlight of the annual cultural calendar is the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Festival Casals</ENAMEX>, a month full of performances given by the world‚Äôs great concert <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX>. Originally inspired by the peerless <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cellist</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conductor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pablo Casals</ENAMEX>, who spent his last <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX>, the festival attracts <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of music <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lovers</ENAMEX>. It takes place <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every June</TIMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">campus</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Puerto Rico</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">R√≠o Piedras</ENAMEX>. Because ticket prices are kept startlingly low (in order to encourage local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> to attend), advance reservations are essential.
LeLoLai
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LeLoLai VIP</ENAMEX> initiative is a package of benefits that offers discounts at many attractions, and participating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>. The package costs <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">just $10</NUMEX>, but the savings can be <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $2,500</NUMEX> if you endeavor to use all the coupons. The package must be purchased after your arrival in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX>. Contact the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Casita Tourist Office</ENAMEX> on your arrival, or call <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">723-3135</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">800-STAR</ENAMEX> (in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX>) for more details.
Gambling
Although it‚Äôs not <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Vegas</ENAMEX>, you will find <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">casinos</ENAMEX> at all the major <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">resort areas</ENAMEX> around the island. The majority are concentrated on the Condado/<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Isla Verde</ENAMEX> strip. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Condado Plaza</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Ashord Avenue</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tel</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">721-1000</ENAMEX>) and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El San Juan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hotel</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Isla Verde</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tel</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">791-0390</ENAMEX>) are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>. 
Most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">casinos</ENAMEX> are open <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">daily¬†‚Äî¬†except</ENAMEX> for a few major holidays¬†‚Äî¬†from <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early afternoon</TIMEX> until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4am</TIMEX>. After dark, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> are required to wear jackets (but not ties).
Nightlife
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Juan</ENAMEX> ‚Äúnever closes,‚Äù they say, with pride. And they‚Äôre absolutely right. Even at sunrise, you‚Äôll see bright-eyed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> heading for an early breakfast after spending <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">all night</TIMEX> at a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">discotheque</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">nightclub</ENAMEX> that stays open until the last <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patron</ENAMEX> departs.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Puerto Ricans</ENAMEX> love entertainment, and they need no excuse to dress up, or generally let their hair down. This is the most switched-on island in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX> for after-dark activities.
The large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Condado</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Isla Verde</ENAMEX> have supper <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clubs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lounges</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">discos</ENAMEX> and piano bars, and flamenco and bomba y plena shows for those who want a taste of traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Puerto Rican</ENAMEX> culture. If you want to do some moving and shaking, there are discotheques and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">nightclubs galore</ENAMEX>.
Old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Juan</ENAMEX>, with its picturesque little musical spots hidden behind discreet wooden doors, doesn‚Äôt hit high gear until after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10pm</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Condado</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Isla Verde</ENAMEX> get started somewhat <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX>. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> practically every place with entertainment imposes a drink purchase minimum. Some also levy a stiff, non-consumable cover charge. During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the week</TIMEX>, drink minimums are normally lowered or eliminated.
For <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚Äúbig-name‚</NUMEX>Äù entertainment, your best bet may be an all-inclusive dinner-show-dancing ticket. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Resident singers</ENAMEX> and comedians perform and a dance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">troupe</ENAMEX> struts its stuff before you take to the dance floor yourself.
During the high (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX>) <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX> and on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">any weekend</TIMEX>, you must reserve seats for a show or a popular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX>. The biggest <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>-on-the-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚Äúsocial Friday‚Äù</ENAMEX> (which begins after work on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</TIMEX> and doesn‚Äôt end until breakfast time <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX>). If you‚Äôre going anywhere in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Juan</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>, allow <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">at least a half-hour extra</TIMEX> to negotiate the traffic.
Sports
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beach Activities</ENAMEX>
Along the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">365 miles</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">587 km</NUMEX>) of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Puerto Rican coastline you‚</ENAMEX>Äôll find all kinds of sandy beaches, some developed, many deserted. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> beaches of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dorado</ENAMEX>, Condado/<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Isla Verde</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Palmas del Mar</ENAMEX> are enticing, offering wonderful soft <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sand</ENAMEX> and a comprehensive range of activities to choose from: you can arrange for kayaking, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">jet</ENAMEX>-skiing, and paragliding through the large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> or the private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> situated on the beach.
In the northwest, around <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rinc√≥n</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aguadilla</ENAMEX>, the waves build to giant heights; surfing and boogie-boarding is extremely popular. Don‚Äôt expect to be able to surf in the south and east, however; because conditions there are not as favorable. Even in the northwest, the waves are best <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between January and March</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golf</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX> has arguably the best golf in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX>. With a number of championship <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some two dozen</NUMEX> 18-hole <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX> scattered across the countryside, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">it‚Äôs</ENAMEX> quite possible to spend <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a week</TIMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> playing a different course <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX>. The greatest concentration of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX> is at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dorado</ENAMEX>, west of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Juan</ENAMEX>. The large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hyatt</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX> here have invested heavily in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX> in upgrading and expanding <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX> that were already well regarded. They‚Äôre all considered challenging.
All courses on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX> are open to the public or non-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guests</ENAMEX>, with the exception of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Conquistador</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fajardo</ENAMEX>, which is for hotel <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guests</ENAMEX> only. Here is a list of some of the better <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX>, working clockwise around the island from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Juan</ENAMEX>:
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bahia Beach Plantation</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">R√≠o Grande</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tel</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">256-5600</ENAMEX>). The course closest to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Juan</ENAMEX>.

Diving and Snorkeling
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Puerto Rico‚</ENAMEX>Äôs waters offer genuine thrills for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">divers</ENAMEX>. The coral reefs on the continental shelf surrounding the island provide an ideal habitat for myriad exotic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> and marine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mammals</ENAMEX>. And since <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX> is on the migratory path of many <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, depending on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the time of year</TIMEX>, you might also be able to view some non-native seasonal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> while exploring the reefs and grottoes. Another attraction for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the wet set is being able to investigate shipwrecks on the ocean <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bottom¬†‚Äî¬†well</ENAMEX> over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX> are known to have sunk hereabouts since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the days</TIMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">galleons</ENAMEX>. Remember to bring your dive certificate with you, as you will only be allowed to rent equipment and dive if you can prove your competence. Here are some of the most exciting dive <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> around the islands:
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fajardo</ENAMEX>. This is the jumping-off point for dives around <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vieques</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Culebra</ENAMEX> and other smaller islands off <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Rico‚Äôs east</ENAMEX> coast. Especially good for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">viewing turtles</ENAMEX> (breeding grounds are nearby) and coral formations.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ponce</ENAMEX>. The sea wall that runs along the south coast between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caja de Muerto</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cayo Cardona</ENAMEX> offers exciting diving at relatively shallow depth, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">around 40 ft</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX>).

If you‚Äôd like to learn how to dive while in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX>, you can contact one of a network of dive <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> that offer training from beginner to professional levels. All <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> are affiliated with one of the major certifying bodies; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PADI</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Professional Association of Diving Instructors</ENAMEX>) is the most common. You‚Äôll need <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five days</TIMEX> to complete the requirements for the basic qualification, the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Open Water</ENAMEX> certificate. Once you have this you‚Äôll be allowed to dive with an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">instructor</ENAMEX> to a depth of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> ft (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX>), which opens up many dive <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> around <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX> to you.
Many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> also offer an introductory session, commonly known as the ‚ÄúDiscover Scuba Program.‚Äù This involves a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning or afternoon</TIMEX> of theory and swimming pool work, which will give you the chance to try out the basic techniques. Many large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> offer this <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äútaster‚Äù</ENAMEX> to their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guests</ENAMEX>. Here are a number of reputable dive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> around the island:
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dorado Marine Center</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dorado; Tel</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">796-4654</ENAMEX>). Snorkeling, resort <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX>, and certification.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caribbean School of Aquatics</ENAMEX>. (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Juan</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tel</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">728-6606</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Certification</ENAMEX> and dive trips, sailing, and exploring.

The best places for snorkeling are in the waters off of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vieques, Culebra</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Mona Island</ENAMEX>. Here the shallow <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX> have not been spoiled by too much human activity. Some of the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">nearer</NUMEX> offshore <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cays</ENAMEX> also offer good opportunities: <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Coffin Island</ENAMEX> off the southern coast near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gu√°nica</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cat Island</ENAMEX> off of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Parguera</ENAMEX> still have clear waters; both are accessible via a short boat trip. The mangrove <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">forests</ENAMEX> around the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Parguera</ENAMEX> also provide an interesting environment to explore; the tidal shallows there are a breeding ground for many species of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>.
Fishing
Sport fishing is very big in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX>, with several major tournaments being launched throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ports</ENAMEX> around the island. But if you‚Äôre not ready to compete, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> for recreational fishing can be rented by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">half day</TIMEX>. If your base is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Juan</ENAMEX>, you‚Äôll only have to travel <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">some 15 minutes</TIMEX> out of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Juan Harbor</ENAMEX> to find a good catch. From <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fajardo</ENAMEX> on the east coast there‚Äôs excellent fishing in the waters around <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Culebra</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vieques</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">approximately 45 minutes</TIMEX> from the port) and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US Virgin Islands</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Parguera</ENAMEX> is also a prime spot for big game fishing. From <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ponce</ENAMEX> there‚Äôs good fishing beyond the reef walls <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about an hour</TIMEX> offshore.

<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Hiking</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Puerto Rico‚</ENAMEX>Äôs natural and unspoiled interior offers lots of opportunity to get away from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> and commune with nature. With such a wealth of different environments to enjoy, it‚Äôs well worth making the effort to leave your <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Yunque</ENAMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caribbean National Forest</ENAMEX>), southeast of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Juan</ENAMEX>, is crisscrossed by numerous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">trails</ENAMEX>. The hike from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">visitors center</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">La Mina Falls</ENAMEX> and back takes <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about an hour</TIMEX>, but there are longer trails if you want to spend a whole day out. Stop by the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">El Portal Tropical Forest Center</ENAMEX> before setting out; guides are available, but you must request one in advance (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tel</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">888-1880</ENAMEX>).
There are several other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX> and forests throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> that have marked <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">trails</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> such as picnic tables:
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carite</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guavate</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Forest</ENAMEX>. Between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Juan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ponce</ENAMEX>, off <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Route 52</ENAMEX>. A <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6000-acre</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,430</NUMEX>-hectare) dwarf forest with <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> no higher than 12 ft (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">31‚ÅÑ2 m</ENAMEX>); several high peaks and a lake.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toro Negro Forest</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North of Ponce</ENAMEX>. The highest point in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rico¬†‚Äî¬†Cerro de Punta</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4,390 ft</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,340</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">m)¬†‚Äî¬†lies</ENAMEX> within this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">reserve</ENAMEX>. The mountain can be scaled via a path off of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Route 143</ENAMEX>; the ascent takes <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">only about 40 minutes</TIMEX> but on a clear day allows views all across the island. You are much more likely to get good weather here than on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Yunque</ENAMEX> (which acts as a magnet for moist winds traveling east across the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX>).
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gu√°nica Forest</ENAMEX>. West of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ponce</ENAMEX>, off <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Route 2</ENAMEX>. This extremely arid and rocky area of land supports a large ‚Äúdry tropical forest.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù Acres</ENAMEX> of cacti and ground-hugging <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> support <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over half</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bird species</ENAMEX> found in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maricao</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East of Mayag√ºez</ENAMEX>. This <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">reserve</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 30</NUMEX> species of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> that grow only here.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Children</ENAMEX>
Young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX> can play for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> on the sandy beaches, jumping waves in the shallows or building <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sand castles</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Condado/Isla Verde or Dorado</ENAMEX> have clean, safe beaches with good <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> and most of the balnearios have a children‚Äôs play area with swings and see-saws, if they tire of the sea and sand. Older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> can fill the whole day with snorkeling and learning about the numerous <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> and marine <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">creatures</ENAMEX> that teem in the shallow waters near the beaches.
Most large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort hotels</ENAMEX> offer activities for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>; some may even have a children‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">club</ENAMEX> at which young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> can make new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> and spend time in group activities like face-painting or organized water sports. Check with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX> before making a reservation.
Always remember to cover young skin with a strong sunblock and to limit children‚Äôs exposure time for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first few days</TIMEX>. Also make sure that they are well supervised whenever they are near the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>.
Here are some attractions and activities that score high points with younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>:
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Morro</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Crist√≥bal</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Children</ENAMEX> enjoy walking the walls and parapets of these forts, imagining what it would have been like to be <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conquistadors</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museo del Ni√±o</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plazuela de las Monjas</ENAMEX>, opposite <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Juan Cathedral</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tel</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">722-3791</ENAMEX>).

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Festivals</ENAMEX> and street parades. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Children</ENAMEX> thoroughly enjoy the spectacle, music, and dancing that is part of any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Puerto Rican</ENAMEX> celebration. Check with the tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> for details during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">your</TIMEX> visit.
