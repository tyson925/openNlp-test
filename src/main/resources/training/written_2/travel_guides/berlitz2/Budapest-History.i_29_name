A Brief History
B y <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> standards, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hungarians</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relative newcomers</ENAMEX>. They have lived in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Carpathian Basin</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a mere 1,100 years¬†‚Äî¬</NUMEX>†but during that time they‚Äôve had more than their share of suffering.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Early Settlers</ENAMEX>
The settlement of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">present-day</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hungary</ENAMEX> goes far back in time. Less than <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">64 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">40 miles</NUMEX>) to the west of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Budapest</ENAMEX>, human traces thought to be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half a million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years old</TIMEX> have been excavated and are now on display at the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hungarian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Museum</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Ô¨Årst</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tribes</ENAMEX> that came to this area brought skills and tools which improved the lot of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hunter</ENAMEX>, made farming feasible, and, in time, gave rise to primitive industries.
Around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the third century</TIMEX> b.c., <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hungary</ENAMEX> was occupied by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Celtic-Illyrian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tribe</ENAMEX> known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eraviscans</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">refugees</ENAMEX> from wars in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX>. They established a tribal centre on top of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Gell√©rt Hill</ENAMEX> and continued the early settlers‚Äô artistic and industrial innovations.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roman Empire</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hungary</ENAMEX> remained beyond the reach of western <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first century</TIMEX> a.d., when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> empire‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">legions</ENAMEX> advanced and pushed its northeast frontier to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Danube</ENAMEX>. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the second century</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 20,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> were deployed along the river between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vienna</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Budapest</ENAMEX>.
To command and coordinate this long, exposed line, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Romans</ENAMEX> built a military <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camp</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aquincum</ENAMEX>, which became the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">home</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 6,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX>, and in time spawned civilian suburbs that housed up to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> times that number. In <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">a.d. 106 Aquincum</ENAMEX> was made the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> empire‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lower Pannonia</ENAMEX>, and its amphitheatres, bathing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX>, aqueducts, and the sheer size and quality of the remains unearthed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">present-day</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Obuda</ENAMEX> testify to its former importance.
As the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX> began to crumble, however, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Huns</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vandals</ENAMEX> swarmed over the river, and during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early fifth century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aquincum</ENAMEX> fell to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tribes</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Attila</ENAMEX>. It is believed that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> on the west side of the river was named after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Attila‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> (or possibly his brother-in-law), <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Buda</ENAMEX>, who was banished there. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Attila</ENAMEX> died in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">453</NUMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Huns</ENAMEX> were overthrown and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avars</ENAMEX> became the dominant power, occupying the region from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the middle of the sixth century</TIMEX> to the early <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">ninth</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">century</TIMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Hungarians</ENAMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tribes</ENAMEX> that were ultimately to settle in the land arrived in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">896</TIMEX>. They had wandered a long way from their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> east of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ural Mountains</ENAMEX>, and fell upon the land with such ferocity that the local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> thought they too were <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Huns</ENAMEX> (one might be tempted to think this is the origin of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hungary</ENAMEX>).
But they were actually <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Magyars</ENAMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Hungarian</ENAMEX> word for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hungarians</ENAMEX>); their language was strange to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">outsiders</ENAMEX>. The tribe‚Äôs name for itself became the name of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> and its language, as well. Related <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tribes</ENAMEX>, who had earlier travelled northwest while the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Magyars</ENAMEX> migrated west, ended up in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Finland</ENAMEX>. Their mutually incomprehensible tongues are classiÔ¨Åed together in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">linguistic Ô¨Åeld</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Finno-Ugric</ENAMEX>.
The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Magyars</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prince</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arp√°d</ENAMEX>, founded a dynasty that lasted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than three centuries</TIMEX> and introduced statehood to the new land. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prince G√©za</ENAMEX>, his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">great-grandson</ENAMEX>, embraced Christianity, and on the legendary date of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas Day a.d. 1000</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G√</ENAMEX>©za‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Istv√°n</ENAMEX>), later <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">St.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Szent Istv√°n</ENAMEX>), was crowned the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hungary</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Esztergom</ENAMEX>, situated on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Danube Bend</ENAMEX>.
The Ô¨Årst record of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pest</ENAMEX>, meaning ‚Äúlime furnace‚Äù or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúovens‚Äù in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Slavic</ENAMEX>, comes from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1061</TIMEX>. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">landmark</ENAMEX> of the nation‚Äôs civilization in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these early days</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golden Bull</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1222</TIMEX> was a sort of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚ÄúMagyar Carta‚</ENAMEX>Äù spelling out the rights of nobles and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commoners</ENAMEX> alike. But the rights of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> were the last thing on the minds of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mongols</ENAMEX>, who overran the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1241</TIMEX> and again in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1242</TIMEX>. Whole <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buda</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pest</ENAMEX>, were subjected to an orgy of killing and destruction. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mongols</ENAMEX> did not stay, however, nor did they return. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">King B√©la IV</ENAMEX> then set about reviving the wrecked <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>, and founded the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buda</ENAMEX>, wisely building it within fortified walls.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Angevin Dynasty</ENAMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arp√</ENAMEX>°d dynasty ended in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1301</TIMEX>; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">French House of Angevin</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anjou</ENAMEX>), in the shape of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K√°roly</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles) R√≥bert</ENAMEX>, claimed the crown. He moved the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Visegr√°d</ENAMEX> before it came permanently to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buda‚Äôs Castle Hill</ENAMEX>.
Two more foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">kings</ENAMEX> ruled after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">R√≥bert</ENAMEX>, but it was a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hungarian</ENAMEX> noble, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">J√°nos Hunyadi</ENAMEX>, who was to become the national saviour in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-15th century</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turks</ENAMEX> had been threatening the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> for some time but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hunyadi</ENAMEX> led the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hungarian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX> to victory against them at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">N√°ndorfeh√©rv√°r</ENAMEX> (now <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Belgrade</ENAMEX>) in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1456</TIMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">J√°nos Hunyadi, Korvin M√°ty√°s</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Matthias Corvinus</ENAMEX>), ascended the throne in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1458</TIMEX> and for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next 32 years</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> enjoyed a golden age of intellectual and civic development. Under this enlightened king‚Äôs rule, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buda</ENAMEX> became an advanced centre of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> culture and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pest</ENAMEX> Ô¨Çourished in trade and industry. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">King M√</ENAMEX>°ty√°s‚Äô <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Palace</ENAMEX> was the talk of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hungarians</ENAMEX> say that when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M√°ty√°s</ENAMEX> died so did justice, resulting in internal strife. Despotic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">noblemen</ENAMEX> repressed the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peasants</ENAMEX> so harshly that an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX> led by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gy√∂rgy D√≥zsa</ENAMEX> rose in rebellion in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1514</TIMEX>, but the insurrection failed; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">D√≥zsa</ENAMEX> was roasted alive and the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">serfs‚Äô condition</ENAMEX> continued to decline.
Meanwhile the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turks</ENAMEX> were again massing for war. This time there was no <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hunyadi</ENAMEX> to lead the weakened <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>, and the king, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lajos</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis) II</ENAMEX>, and much of his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX> were killed at the battle of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moh√°cs</ENAMEX> (in southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hungary</ENAMEX>) in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1526</TIMEX>.
The neighbouring <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Austrian Habsburg</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rulers</ENAMEX>, fearful that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vienna</ENAMEX> would be the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottoman</ENAMEX> empire‚Äôs next conquest, proclaimed themselves <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rulers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hungary</ENAMEX>, thus creating a buffer zone between themselves and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turks</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hungary</ENAMEX> was effectively dismembered: the north and west fell to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Habsburgs; Transylvania</ENAMEX> became a so-called independent principality under <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> auspices; and central <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hungary</ENAMEX> came under direct <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> rule. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turks Ô¨Ånally</ENAMEX> occupied <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Buda</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1541</TIMEX> and stayed there for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">almost a century</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a half</TIMEX>, achieving and bequeathing little of note except, of course, their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">baths</ENAMEX>.
By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 17th century</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">armies</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West</ENAMEX> were fully mobilized against the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottoman</ENAMEX> inÔ¨Ådels. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Long</ENAMEX>, devastating sieges were laid to both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buda</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pest</ENAMEX> and, when Ô¨Ånally liberated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1686</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> once again lay in ruins.
Under the Habsburgs
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hungarian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> then found themselves under the rule of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Habsburgs</ENAMEX>, which was not much better than life under the pashas, and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1703</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prince</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferenc R√°k√≥czi</ENAMEX> led an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eight-year</TIMEX> struggle for independence. Outnumbered and deserted by their <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">allies</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hungarians Ô¨Ånally</ENAMEX> lost the war in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1711</TIMEX>.
Peace lasted for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the rest of the century</TIMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> made great economic strides as a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Habsburg</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Factories</ENAMEX>, theatres, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX> were opened and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pest</ENAMEX> expanded its role in international trade while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buda</ENAMEX> regained its status as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hungary‚</ENAMEX>Äôs administrative centre.
But prosperity was not for the majority. The rich were getting richer while the serfs were getting poorer, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Magyar</ENAMEX> identity was being repressed by the influence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Germanic Habsburgs</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-19th century</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hungarians</ENAMEX> once again went to war for their independence.
The rebellion of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1848</TIMEX> was led by a group of young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intellectuals</ENAMEX>, including the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25-year-old</TIMEX> radical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poet</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S√°ndor PetoÔ¨Å</ENAMEX>. A provisional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> was formed, headed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lajos Kossuth</ENAMEX>, but it was short-lived. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Emperor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Franz Joseph</ENAMEX> I summoned help from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Czar</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> and the revolt was crushed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1849</TIMEX>.
All was not totally lost, however. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1867</TIMEX>, under a compromise designed to curtail home-rule agitation, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Austro-Hungarian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX> was established and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hungary</ENAMEX> was Ô¨Ånally granted its own <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>, though key <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ministries</ENAMEX> were shared with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Austrians</ENAMEX>. This ‚ÄúDual Monarchy‚Äù saw out <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th century</TIMEX> on a bright note, with splendid <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boulevards</ENAMEX> and proud <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> erected to create the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pest</ENAMEX> we recognize <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Chain Bridge</ENAMEX> became the Ô¨Årst permanent link across the river, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pest</ENAMEX> metro and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pest</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vienna</ENAMEX> railway opened, and, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1873</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pest, Buda</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Obuda</ENAMEX> merged to become <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Budapest</ENAMEX>.
Wars and Revolutions
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1914</TIMEX>, as part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Austro-Hungarian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hungary</ENAMEX> was called upon to enter <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">I. Their</ENAMEX> involvement in the war cost <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">many thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hungarian</ENAMEX> lives, and the country‚Äôs hardships multiplied.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 1918</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hungary‚Äôs</ENAMEX> last <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">K√°roly IV</ENAMEX>, was toppled by what is now called the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bourgeois Democratic Revolution</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">revolutionaries</ENAMEX> joined with the newly-born <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hungarian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">communist</ENAMEX> movement, but took their reform demands too far and too fast, and only succeeded in provoking a right-wing backlash led by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Admiral Mikl√≥s Horthy</ENAMEX>.
Meanwhile, the aftermath of war, as dictated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1920 Treaty of Trianon</ENAMEX>, was to cost <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hungary</ENAMEX> very dearly. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">About two-thirds</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, including the traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">homeland</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transylvania</ENAMEX>, was handed over to the new <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚ÄúSuccessor States‚Äù¬†‚Äî¬†Romania</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yugoslavia</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Czechoslovakia</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Horthy</ENAMEX> maintained his role as regent in the grim <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenties</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirties</TIMEX> while the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, demoralized and impoverished, seethed over the treaty.
Hitler‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>, meanwhile, provided investment in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hungarian</ENAMEX> industry and a market for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hungarian</ENAMEX> farm <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">produce</ENAMEX>, and earned a grudging admiration from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hungarians</ENAMEX> for its deÔ¨Åance of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War I</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">allies</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1940</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hungary</ENAMEX> allowed the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX> to cross its <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">territory</ENAMEX> and, as a reward, they temporarily recovered parts of its former lands from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Romania</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yugoslavia</ENAMEX>. It was a false <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">dawn</TIMEX> before the country‚Äôs blackest <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hungarians</ENAMEX> died supporting the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Germans</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Front</ENAMEX>, and just as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Horthy</ENAMEX> thought he could squirm out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hitler‚</ENAMEX>Äôs grasp by declaring neutrality in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1944</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> was occupied by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Germans</ENAMEX>.
As the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX> moved closer to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Budapest</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late 1944</TIMEX> and the bombing of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> became more intense, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Horthy</ENAMEX> played his last card by declaring an armistice. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Germans</ENAMEX> responded by installing in power a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hungarian</ENAMEX> fascist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> called the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arrow Cross</ENAMEX>. This brutal, fanatical regime murdered <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Budapestis</ENAMEX> and ensured further destruction of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> by Ô¨Åghting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Red Army</ENAMEX> to the death. By the time the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russians</ENAMEX> Ô¨Ånally took <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Budapest</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three-quarters</NUMEX> of its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> were demolished and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hungarian</ENAMEX> death toll in the war came to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about half a million</NUMEX>.
In and Out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Red</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Post-war Hungary</ENAMEX> was transformed from a republic (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1946</TIMEX>) into a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">People‚Äôs Republic</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1949</TIMEX>). Life under the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviets</ENAMEX> was not much brighter than existence under the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Nazis</ENAMEX>. After a hopeful democratic beginning with free elections, fear and turbulence ensued. Stalin‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M√°ty√°s R√°kosi</ENAMEX>, established his sinister <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AVO</ENAMEX> secret <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> to ensure compliance with party doctrine.
After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eight years</TIMEX> of often brutal repression the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> had had enough and, on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23 October 1956</TIMEX>, marched on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parliament</ENAMEX> to air their grievances. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> were met with police <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bullets</ENAMEX>. The protest snowballed into a popular uprising and within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> a provisional <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hungarian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>, led by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Imre Nagy</ENAMEX>, had withdrawn from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Warsaw Pact</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> retribution took <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">just 12 days</TIMEX>. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4 November</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Red Army</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tanks</ENAMEX> entered <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Budapest</ENAMEX> and quickly crushed the armed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West</ENAMEX> watched in horror as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nagy</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> more were executed. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Some 200,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hungarians</ENAMEX> Ô¨Çed the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviets</ENAMEX> installed <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">J√°nos K√°d√°r</ENAMEX> as the new party <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boss</ENAMEX>. Although rule began in repressive fashion, gradually, by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-1960s</TIMEX>, severe ideological doctrines were being relaxed. Hungarians embraced a form of consumerism; they were allowed to take holidays in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West</ENAMEX> (though limited to once every <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three or four years</TIMEX>, and not to every Western <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>), and the ‚Äúgoulash economy,‚Äù even though it failed to meet its potential, was held up as a model in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eastern bloc</ENAMEX>.
As the winds of perestroika blew in from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moscow</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">K√°d√°r</ENAMEX> was removed from power in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX>, and, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX>, the formation of opposition <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> was legalized. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hungary</ENAMEX> was the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">Ô¨Årst country</ENAMEX> to draw back its Iron Curtain, dismantling the barbed wire along its <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Austrian</ENAMEX> border and allowing <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">East Germans</ENAMEX> to escape to the West. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> held its Ô¨Årst free elections in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43 years</TIMEX> and was called a republic again; in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX> it became an associate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Community</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hungary</ENAMEX> was offered membership in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX>.
The transition from communism to capitalism has not been easy, as all the former <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eastern bloc</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> have found, but <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hungary</ENAMEX>, at least, has a significant share of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Western</ENAMEX> investments to help support its rather fragile economy. As a bridge between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">East</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Europe</ENAMEX> it is well positioned for any improvement in trade between the two geo-political blocks. Its hopes for the future are full membership of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Union</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> things rare in the history of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hungary</ENAMEX>: namely, peace and freedom.
