What to Do
Sports
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> you can enjoy all kinds of sports, from jogging to hang-gliding, from cycling to snorkeling, and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> you can even squeeze a morning‚Äôs surfing and an afternoon‚Äôs downhill skiing into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Golden State</ENAMEX> is a paradise for outdoor activities, but we start with what must be <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">California‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">favorite</ENAMEX>.
Watersports
If you get no other exercise while you‚Äôre in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>, it would be difficult to go without <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least one day</TIMEX> of swimming at the beach. It‚Äôs no coincidence that most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States‚Äô</ENAMEX> champion swimmers come from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southern California</ENAMEX>. In the middle-class neighborhoods of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">county</ENAMEX> it seems that every other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX> has its own swimming pool¬†‚Äî¬†from the air you see the mass of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">turquoise blobs</ENAMEX> as you fly into the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX>.
Surfing, snorkeling, scuba diving, sailing, fishing, waterskiing, and windsurfing can all be enjoyed at various points on the coast. Everyone has their favorite beach or bay, and some are better for one sport than another.
Good beaches in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego</ENAMEX> area can be found at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Silver Strand</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mission</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">La Jolla</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> the best beaches are <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Redondo</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Monica</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hermosa</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manhattan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venice</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malibu</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zuma</ENAMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> warning to swimmers farther north, however¬†‚Äî¬†at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">resort village</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Carmel</ENAMEX>-by-the-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sea</ENAMEX> and up past <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX>, the beaches are fine for sunbathing, but strong undercurrents make the sea too dangerous for swimming.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Surfing</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Surfers</ENAMEX> have been riding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">California‚</ENAMEX>Äôs waves since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1907</TIMEX>, although the sport achieved legendary status in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s</TIMEX> through the songs <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">of the Beach Boys</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> rates second only to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hawaii</ENAMEX> for surfing, though some <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Australians</ENAMEX> may argue the point.
The best waves for surfing are at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malibu</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Point Duma</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Surfrider</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Monica State Beach</ENAMEX> (north of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pier</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">La Jolla</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Windansea Beach</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Pier</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ocean Beach</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Onofre</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North County</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oceanside Jetty</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Swammies</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ensenada</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Snorkeling</ENAMEX>.

The sheltered waters of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mission Bay</ENAMEX> are an ideal nursery for learning the basics of boat handling, while for the more experienced and adventurous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sailors</ENAMEX> the wide Pacific waits outside.

<ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">Tennis</ENAMEX>. Public <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX> are plentiful and either free or inexpensive¬†‚Äî¬†just <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a few dollars</NUMEX> an hour, even in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beverly Hills</ENAMEX> (at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Roxbury Park</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">401</NUMEX> S. <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Roxbury Drive</ENAMEX>).

There are also good golf <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Palm Springs</ENAMEX>.
Running. In this fitness-crazy state you can run just about everywhere, best of all barefoot along the beach. Sports <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> will attempt to sell you all manner of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äúessential‚Äù running equipment¬†‚Äî¬†haute couture tracksuits</ENAMEX> and shoes, lap timers, sweatbands, pedometers¬†‚Äî¬†but all you really need is a good pair of running shoes and a towel.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cycling</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cycling</ENAMEX> is very well catered for, especially in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Barbara</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Monterey</ENAMEX>.

Roller-skating.

At college level, where the antics of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fans</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cheerleaders</ENAMEX> are far more spirited than at the professional matches, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> with the strongest tradition is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trojans</ENAMEX>, from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USC</ENAMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Southern California</ENAMEX>) in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>.

Entertainment
Nightlife
If you want to enjoy a night out on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, then <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> definitely has the edge over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>. The ‚ÄúCity by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bay‚</ENAMEX>Äù is one of the world‚Äôs classic drinking <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX>, crammed with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">boisterous bars</ENAMEX>, cozy caf√©s, sophisticated bistros, and lively <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">nightclubs</ENAMEX>, not to mention jumping jazz joints.

In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clubs</ENAMEX> are perhaps trendier, and certainly more expensive, but the sheer size of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">L.A.</ENAMEX> makes a car pretty much a necessity for cruising the nightspots (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">taxi</ENAMEX> fares will be very expensive for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than a short</TIMEX> trip). The best areas for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clubs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX> are around <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Hollywood</ENAMEX>, on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Sunset Boulevard</ENAMEX>, near the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UCLA</ENAMEX> campus in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Westwood Village</ENAMEX>, and out by the coast. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Monica</ENAMEX> is one area you can explore on foot, and there are many attractive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX> along <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Main Street</ENAMEX> and at the ocean ends of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wilshire</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Monica</ENAMEX> boulevards.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sleepy San Diego</ENAMEX> has managed to create a venue for nightlife in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gaslamp Quarter</ENAMEX> downtown. During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the week</TIMEX> you may wonder where everyone has gone, especially during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the winter months</TIMEX>, but in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX> and on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekends</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sidewalks</ENAMEX> are jammed with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX> haunting the music <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clubs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bars</ENAMEX>, and the many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">5th Street</ENAMEX> hum with activity.
Music
Classical. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra</ENAMEX> gives excellent concerts at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dorothy Chandler Pavilion</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Music Center</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">performs open-air ‚ÄúSymphonies</ENAMEX> under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stars‚</ENAMEX>Äù at the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Hollywood Bowl</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX>.

Tickets are modestly priced and the cable <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> will take you to within <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> blocks of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>.
Jazz. Try to take in some of this quintessential <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> musical style. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> has many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clubs</ENAMEX> offering live jazz in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the evening</TIMEX>, and occasionally at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">lunchtime</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">too¬†‚Äî¬†‚Äújazz brunch‚Äù</ENAMEX> is becoming something of a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Coast</ENAMEX>. Try <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Jazz at Pearl‚</ENAMEX>Äôs in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Beach</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tel</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">415/291-8255</ENAMEX>) or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yoshi‚</ENAMEX>Äôs in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oakland</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tel</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">510/238-9200</ENAMEX>).

Theater
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Theater</ENAMEX> gets too much competition from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cinema</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> to reach a consistently high level, but occasionally there are good visiting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ahmanson Theatre</ENAMEX> and at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Shubert Theatre</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Century City</ENAMEX>.

Its repertory <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX> runs from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September</TIMEX> through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Broadway</ENAMEX> hits appear next door at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Curran Theater</ENAMEX> or a few blocks away at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Golden Gate Theater</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Orpheum</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">All three</NUMEX> venues share the same telephone number (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tel</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">415/551-2000</ENAMEX>).
