What To Do
Spend any time in this area, and you‚Äôll quickly realize that life along <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific Mexico</ENAMEX> is much more than ‚Äújust a beach.‚Äù There is a wealth of outdoor adventures, cultural encounters, and the simple pleasures of local village life .
Entertainment
Fiestas 
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> is known for its countless festivities and perennial spirit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">celebration¬†‚Äî¬†Mexicans</ENAMEX> may have even invented the ‚Äúart of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX>.‚Äù In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>, it‚Äôs a given that any reason is a reason to celebrate, and traditional fiestas will include the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, with plenty of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> and drink, contributed by all those involved.
Mexico‚Äôs folkloric traditions have become the centerpiece of the modern <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">‚ÄúMexican Fiesta</ENAMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">‚Äù</ENAMEX> created especially with the tourist in mind. These full evenings of entertainment generally include a makeshift marketplace featuring artesan√≠a for sale, a buffet <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> dinner, games (involving drinking large quantities of tequila), mariachi music, a presentation of folkloric dance from around the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, and a generous supply of margaritas and other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beverages</ENAMEX>. Most of the time these are smallish presentations, with dances performed by amateur <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>; at their worst, they can be truly gaudy and almost laughable shows.
The exception is in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Acapulco</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Centro de Convenciones</ENAMEX> offers arguably the best <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Fiesta Mexicana</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, and is the closest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">you‚</ENAMEX>Äôll come to an authentic display of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> culture and dance. Along with beautifully performed folkloric dances from all over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>, you‚Äôll <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witness</ENAMEX> a pre-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanic</ENAMEX> ceremony called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los Voladores de Papantla</ENAMEX>, which represents an invocation to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cardinal</ENAMEX> points and a prayer for fertility; a floreador roping exhibition; and the vibrant sounds of the mariachi. This fiesta is held <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every Monday</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7 to 10pm</TIMEX>. Reservations are recommended, to ensure a good table. For reservations, call <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tel</ENAMEX>. (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">7</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">484-7046</ENAMEX>.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Vallarta</ENAMEX> one fiesta that stands out from the rest is not a traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Fiesta Mexicana</ENAMEX> at all, but <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an evening</TIMEX> at the secluded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caletas</ENAMEX> cove, accessible only by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ritmos de la Noche</ENAMEX> (‚ÄúRhythms of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Night‚Äù</ENAMEX>) is a truly magical experience. You travel by fast <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">catamarans</ENAMEX> to the former <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Huston</ENAMEX>, where you‚Äôll be greeted by native drums and abundant <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tiki torches¬†‚Äî¬†there</ENAMEX> is no electricity <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">here¬†‚Äî¬†then dine</ENAMEX> by candlelight at tables set along the secluded beach. Following dinner, the jungle, sounds of nature, and a replica of a pyramid are the backdrop for a performance of pre-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanic</ENAMEX> dances with a unique contemporary choreographic twist. The show is held from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX> through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX>. Call <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tel</ENAMEX>. (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">221-0657</TIMEX>, for reservations.
Nightlife
Any place built on pleasing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vacationers</ENAMEX> is bound to have its share of nocturnal attractions. Along <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific Mexico</ENAMEX>, the options are as varied as the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> themselves, ranging from the dazzling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">discos</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Acapulco</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">quaint weekly ‚Äúdances‚Äù</ENAMEX> on dirt <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floors</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barra de Navidad</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Puerto Vallarta</ENAMEX> is making a name for itself with its vast selection of live music. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> stretch of street¬<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">†‚Äî¬†Ignacio L. Vallarta</ENAMEX>, just across the southbound <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bridge¬†‚Äî¬†is</ENAMEX> known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockin‚</ENAMEX>Äô Row, for its eclectic collection of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clubs</ENAMEX>. Within easy walking distance from one another, you‚Äôll find a blues <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">club</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harley-Davidson</ENAMEX>-theme rock n‚Äô roll <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">club</ENAMEX>, a salsa dance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">club</ENAMEX>, live mariachi music, a glitzy gay <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">club</ENAMEX> (with nightly leather <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ranch</ENAMEX>-hands‚Äô show), an alternative dance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">club</ENAMEX>, and a sports <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX>.
Still, the malec√≥n rules when it comes to sheer rowdy nighttime fun. Along with the longstanding <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carlos O‚ÄôBrians</ENAMEX>, several <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">open-air bars</ENAMEX> and dance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clubs</ENAMEX> stay open until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5am</TIMEX>, and a new <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cuban</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX>-bar pleases <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patrons</ENAMEX> with authentic food and live music nightly until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3am</TIMEX>. Just a few blocks in back of the malec√≥n are a growing collection of unique <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clubs</ENAMEX> with a more urban edge. Among them is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">La Cantina</ENAMEX>, a hipper version of a <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Mexican</ENAMEX> classic. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX> it serves classic cantina fare, by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> it clamors with the sound of conversation mixed with the best in contemporary recorded <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> music. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Board</ENAMEX> games are available for play.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marina Vallarta</ENAMEX> is quieter at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>, with the lighthouse-top <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lounge</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Faro</ENAMEX>, a favorite for spending a romantic <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</TIMEX>, listening to live flamenco guitar. Along the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hotel Zone</ENAMEX>, the throwback disco <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christine</ENAMEX> still manages to draw a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX> for the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nightly</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midnight</TIMEX> laser show, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">J&B</ENAMEX> is a very hot spot for true <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> dancing; a favorite with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locals</ENAMEX>, it‚Äôs open until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5am</TIMEX>. Also downtown, you‚Äôll find the imported <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Hard Rock Caf√©, Planet Hollywood, and Hooters</ENAMEX>, but they tend to draw lesser <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowds</ENAMEX> than the locally-owned options.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">You‚Äôll</ENAMEX> find a more traditional nightlife, consisting of a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekly</TIMEX> ‚Äúdance‚Äù that takes place in an outdoor <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stadium</ENAMEX> or on a makeshift dance floor in smaller coastal <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yelapa</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cruz de Loreto</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barra de Navidad</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Banda</ENAMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ranchero</TIMEX>-style music tends to dominate, but anything from hip-hop to classic rock may be tossed in for good measure.
Manzanillo, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ixtapa</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zihuatanejo</ENAMEX> offer less in the way of nightlife. Manzanillo‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clubs</ENAMEX> are few, but crowded, and feature recorded music for dancing. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> music <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clubs</ENAMEX> get going around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10pm</TIMEX>, and don‚Äôt even show up before <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midnight</TIMEX> at the techno and alternative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clubs</ENAMEX>. The majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clubs</ENAMEX>, and the ubiquitous <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carlos ‚Äòn‚Äô Charlie‚Äôs</ENAMEX>, are located along the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">boulevard</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miguel de la</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ixtapa</ENAMEX>, sunset happy hours offer the most options, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fiestas</ENAMEX> seem to be a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúbest bet‚Äù</ENAMEX> for a complete <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</TIMEX>. Other <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">later night</TIMEX> offerings are a sampling of what you‚Äôll find in any <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">resort town</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>: Christine‚Äôs disco at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Krystal Hotel</ENAMEX>, Sr. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Frogs</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carlos ‚Äòn‚Äô Charlie‚Äôs</ENAMEX>. The only really original option here is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">club</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">La Valentina</ENAMEX>, a combination restaurant/video <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX> with a desert-inspired <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">d√©cor</ENAMEX>.
There is no doubt that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Acapulco</ENAMEX> rules when it comes to nightlife. In fact, I would venture that most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> here come especially for that. Anyone that believes disco is dead hasn‚Äôt been to <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Acapulco¬†‚Äî¬†it‚Äôs</ENAMEX> alive and well, and happens nightly in an array of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clubs</ENAMEX> that get going around <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midnight</TIMEX> and often close after the sun comes up. The most majestic of these, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Enigma</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palladium</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fantasy</ENAMEX>, are located in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Las Brisas</ENAMEX> section of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, with towering, floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking stunning views of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Acapulco Bay</ENAMEX> in all its <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>-lit splendor.
Along the main <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hotel Zone</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clubs</ENAMEX> are closed-in, but still offer sultry-hot music made for dancing; among them are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alebriges, Andromeda</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baby-O. The Condessa</ENAMEX> stretch of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Costera</ENAMEX> is host to a string of open-air beach bars, with the most popular being <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Disco Beach</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Sombrero</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">pirate-</ENAMEX>theme <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barbaroja</ENAMEX>. These offer dancing under the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stars</ENAMEX> with a view of the ocean. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX> here is young¬<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">†‚Äî¬†very young¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†and the general rule is that one cover charge entitles you to all you can drink. Special coupons are handed out aggressively on the beaches during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX>, in hopes of luring the biggest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX> that <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>.
If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acapulco‚</ENAMEX>Äôs legendary fame reached its zenith in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1940s and 1950s</TIMEX>, why not visit a legend of a nightspot? The photos on the walls of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pepe‚Äôs Piano Bar</ENAMEX> attest to the fact it has hosted more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stars</ENAMEX> than the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Acapulco</ENAMEX> sky¬†‚Äî¬†many of whom have joined in to entertain the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> in this red-velvet enclave of lounge music and martinis. Another exclusively <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Acapulco</ENAMEX> night spot is <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Salon Q</ENAMEX>, located across from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Convention Center</ENAMEX>. This <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> dance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">club</ENAMEX> features live shows <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each weekend</TIMEX> with impersonators doing their best on the hottest talents of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tequilas Le Club</ENAMEX>, located in the old section of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, is a long-standing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Acapulco</ENAMEX> cabaret that offers <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">impersonator</ENAMEX> shows <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nightly¬†‚Äî¬†one ‚Äúinternational‚Äù</ENAMEX> version, with the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">later</TIMEX> show featuring <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> divas.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sports and Outdoor Activities</ENAMEX>
Although this region originally attracted the attention of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> due its spectacular beaches backed by tropical jungle landscapes, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific Mexico</ENAMEX> also offers a varied geography tailor-made for sports and outdoor activities. The temperate, tropical climate means you are likely to enjoy sunshine throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX>, and only <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seasonal</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">late afternoon</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rains</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer months</TIMEX> might interrupt a golf game or other active endeavor. Of particular interest are the increasing variety of ecologically and culturally oriented tours and excursions now available here.
Active <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sports</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golf and Tennis</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">Golf</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">area</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Punta Mita</ENAMEX> on the northern tip of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Banderas Bay</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manzanillo</ENAMEX> in the south is beginning to rival <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los Cabos</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mexico‚Äôs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">golf mecca</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Six</NUMEX> exceptional golf <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX> are located here, notable not only for their challenging designs coupled, with ocean and jungle views, but also for their absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowds</ENAMEX> and reasonable prices. The newest is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Nicklaus‚</ENAMEX>Äìdesigned course at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Four Seasons Punta Mita</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tel</ENAMEX>. (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">291-6000</ENAMEX>) located <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 minutes</TIMEX> north of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Vallarta</ENAMEX>, notable for a spectacular hole that drives to a natural island <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">175 yards</NUMEX> offshore. Currently, it is open only to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guests</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Four Seasons</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">golf clubs</ENAMEX> with a letter of introduction. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX> are located near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Vallarta</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Club de Golf Flamingos</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tel</ENAMEX>. (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">298-0606</ENAMEX>), a casual course open to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe Finger‚</ENAMEX>Äìdesigned course at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marina Vallarta Golf Club</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tel</ENAMEX>. (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">221-0073</ENAMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX> are scheduled to open in the surrounding area by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid 2001</TIMEX>.
Traveling south along the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Costa Alegre</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> spectacular courses offer exclusive play and multiple ocean views. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isla Navidad</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tel</ENAMEX>. (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">355-5103</ENAMEX>) is one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mexico‚</ENAMEX>Äôs top-rated resort <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX>, designed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Von Hagge</ENAMEX>.

The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">course</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">El Tamarindo</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tel</ENAMEX>. (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">551-5031</ENAMEX>) may not be as renown as the others, but it is a lush beauty of a course set in a tropical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rainforest</ENAMEX> by the sea. The approaches to the holes wind through jungle <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">paths</ENAMEX>, and fairways and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">greens</ENAMEX> are gently worked into the mountainous terrain bordering the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific Ocean</ENAMEX>.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manzanillo</ENAMEX>, golf <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">is an integral part</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Las Hadas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> where <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">La Mantarray</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">golf course</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tel</ENAMEX>.

It‚Äôs a rather small and narrow course, designed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mario Schjetnan Dant√°n</ENAMEX>.
Green fees range <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between US$55 and US$135</NUMEX>. Most golf <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX> have <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">carts</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clubs</ENAMEX> for rent.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">Tennis</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Courts</ENAMEX> are so plentiful, you rarely have to wait to play.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Water Sports</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Puerto Vallarta</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Banderas Bay</ENAMEX> have some of the most dramatic diving and snorkeling along the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific Coast</ENAMEX>. The enormous bay offers sheltered <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX> that are inhabited by myriad marine <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">creatures</ENAMEX>. Among the amazing sea life are the giant mantas and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eagle mantas</ENAMEX> that traverse the bay.

Every cove along the coast from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Vallarta</ENAMEX> south to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Huatulco</ENAMEX> has the potential to be a great snorkeling spot. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Isla Ixtapa</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ixtapa</ENAMEX>, and the numerous coves and islets around <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Huatulco</ENAMEX> are prime spots, with calm <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX> for beginners. Most bay cruises offer snorkeling as part of their excursion. Also, dive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> and most of the larger, beachfront <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> rent snorkeling gear, so you can explore the beaches on your own.

Deep-sea fishing is excellent all along the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific</ENAMEX> coast. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manzanillo</ENAMEX> has earned a reputation for being one of the best year-round spots for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">marlin</ENAMEX> and sailfish. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Winter</ENAMEX> is best for dorado (also known as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">mahi-mahi</ENAMEX>), and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> wahoo and roosterfish are the main catches.

A word for those enamored of hiking: As a rule, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> there are no marked <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">trails</ENAMEX> or ranger <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stations</ENAMEX> such as you commonly find in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>.

Whether along a deserted stretch of beach, or in the foothills of tropical <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">mountains</ENAMEX>, horseback riding is an excellent way to enjoy the exquisite landscapes of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific Mexico</ENAMEX>. Tour <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operators</ENAMEX> and travel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> in all the destinations listed in this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guide</ENAMEX> can arrange horseback tours, or you may even be approached by independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operators</ENAMEX> while you sunbathe at the beach.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manzanillo</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Vallarta</ENAMEX> are both noted for birdwatching. Manzanillo‚Äòs best birdwatching takes place in the several lagoons that lie along the coastline, especially <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Laguna de las Garzas</ENAMEX>, (also know as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Laguna de San Pedrito</ENAMEX>), and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Laguna de Cuyutl√°n¬†‚Äî¬†both</ENAMEX> near the downtown and hotel zones.

Nearby is one of the top birdwatching lagoons in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Laguna del Quelele</ENAMEX>. The offshore <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Marietas Islands</ENAMEX> offer the rare opportunity to sight <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blue</ENAMEX>- (and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Yellow-</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Footed Booby Birds</ENAMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Whale</ENAMEX>-watching is an awe-inspiring experience, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican Pacific</ENAMEX> is one of the few places in the world that offers an opportunity to view these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">majestic mammals</ENAMEX> in their natural habitat. From <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late November through March</TIMEX>, the waters of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Banderas Bay</ENAMEX> become the breeding and calving grounds for <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">hundreds of migrating</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">humpback whales</ENAMEX>, much to the delight of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> that enjoy witnessing the breaching, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spy</ENAMEX>-hopping, leaps, and other displays of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">whale</ENAMEX> behavior. Eco-conscious tour <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operators</ENAMEX> throughout the bay (most are based in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Vallarta</ENAMEX>) have voluntarily established norms for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">whale</ENAMEX>-watching, which allow up-close observation while disturbing them as minimally as possible.

Another <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seasonal</TIMEX>, and very worthwhile eco-conscious activity, is to participate in the nightly sea <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">turtle</ENAMEX> releases and watches that take place from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August</TIMEX> through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November</TIMEX> along the shores of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Banderas Bay</ENAMEX>, and further south in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mazunte</ENAMEX> (located between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Huatulco</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Escondido</ENAMEX>). Preservation <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> and trained <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX> conduct these releases and watches. You participate by helping to collect the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">turtles‚Äô eggs</ENAMEX> and taking them to a safe nesting area for incubation.

When it comes to unforgettable experiences, few compare to the unique feeling of swimming with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dolphins</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> has some of the best dolphin <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> in the world. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dolphin Adventure</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Vallarta</ENAMEX> is considered the best in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latin America</ENAMEX>, both for its exceptional treatment of these mammals as well as its affiliated research and environmental education programs.

In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Vallarta</ENAMEX>, a cruise may be on any type vessel, from a charter sailboat to an oversize <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">catamaran</ENAMEX>, even to an exact replica of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher Columbus‚Äôs Santa Maria</ENAMEX>. There is something to fit every taste. Both <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sunset cruises</ENAMEX> are offered; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX> cruises generally include visits to funky or secluded beaches that are only accessible by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX>.

To say that it‚Äôs a rush is an understatement, and their eco-conscious pamphlet is good for a chuckle, considering the reality of the experience. They are, however, making new rafting excursions available for those who prefer to experience the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Papagayo River</ENAMEX> a little closer to its natural <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shopping</ENAMEX>
At <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> glance, shopping in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific Mexico</ENAMEX> may seem disappointing.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Acapulco</ENAMEX> is the place for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boutiques</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designer</ENAMEX> clothing.

You can find goods here from all over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">silver</ENAMEX> from nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taxco</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Talavera</ENAMEX> pottery from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puebla</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barro Negro</ENAMEX>, the shiny black ceramic from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oaxaca</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Artesan√≠a</ENAMEX> created closer to home, in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Acapulco‚Äôs</ENAMEX> home <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guerrero</ENAMEX>, includes lacquered chests and plates from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Olinal√°</ENAMEX>, as well as the white huipiles (an indigenous style blouse), embroidered in brightly colored shades of orange, red, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosa Mexicano</ENAMEX> (hot pink). Other traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Acapulco</ENAMEX> wares are coconut shell <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carvings</ENAMEX>, usually monkey‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heads</ENAMEX>, as well as decorative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">seashell</ENAMEX> ornaments, and regional <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">candies</ENAMEX> made of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coconut</ENAMEX> and tamarind.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Puerto Vallarta</ENAMEX> has more to offer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shoppers</ENAMEX> in search of creative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artesan√≠a</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vallarta</ENAMEX> is a great place to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">authentic¬†‚Äî¬†even custom-made huaraches</ENAMEX> (the flat-sole <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">leather sandals)¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†as well as manta <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">cotton</ENAMEX> clothing, often decorated with colorful hand-painted designs. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Silver</ENAMEX> jewelry seems to be available everywhere, from the elegant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> along the malec√≥n, to strolling beach <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendors</ENAMEX>.

Wherever you go, you‚Äôll find a market where artesan√≠a of various types and quality are interspersed with local clothing, woven handbags, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hippie</ENAMEX>-style jewelry, religious memorabilia, and regional <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Acapulco</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Vallarta</ENAMEX> also have flea markets, with <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stalls</ENAMEX> of souvenirs, T-shirts, huaraches, silver jewelry, wooden puppets, traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> rag dolls, onyx chess sets, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ceramics</ENAMEX>, and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> goods from around <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>.
Best Buys 
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ceramics</ENAMEX>. Both <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Talavera</ENAMEX> ceramics from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puebla</ENAMEX>, and majolica <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ceramics</ENAMEX> are found in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">region¬†‚Äî¬†but don‚</ENAMEX>Äôt mistake one for the other. Both have the same style, using bright colors like yellow, burnt orange, and royal blue, or a blue and off-white scheme, in designs that include <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> and geometric shapes. The only way that you can tell them apart is by looking on the back of the piece and checking for the mark and the signature of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">maker¬†‚Äî¬†only ceramics</ENAMEX> that have been handcrafted in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Talavera</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Puebla</ENAMEX> can be called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚ÄúTalavera</ENAMEX>.‚Äù All other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ceramics</ENAMEX> with the same technique and design are known as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äúmajolica</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù Because Talavera</ENAMEX> comes from a very specific <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> and only a few workshops produce this type of ceramic, it is more expensive than majolica, even though majolica can be just as beautiful.
Leather goods. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jalisco</ENAMEX> is especially noted for its tooled <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">leather goods</ENAMEX>, an art stemming from the traditions of the charros¬†(<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ranchers</ENAMEX>, highly skilled in the roping and handling of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX>), dating back to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the days</TIMEX> of the haciendas. No self-respecting charro would be caught without his cintur√≥n piteado, a tooled leather belt, decorated with piteado, a type of fine work where thin threads are sewn into the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">leather</ENAMEX> forming beautiful flower or geometric patterns that may even include the owner‚Äôs name. This same workmanship may be appreciated in authentic charro boots and fine saddles. The finer the thread, and the more complex the pattern, the more expensive the piece.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tequila</ENAMEX> and mezcal. What better place to get the real thing than a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> that just happens to be located in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> where all tequila is produced? <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Puerto Vallarta</ENAMEX> is located <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">330 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">205 miles</NUMEX>) from the source of all production, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of Tequila. A good bottle of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tequila¬†‚Äî¬†made</ENAMEX>, bought, and sampled in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Jalisco¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†has no match. Make certain to look for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agave Azul</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> blue agave) legend on the bottle to ensure you are purchasing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tequila‚</ENAMEX>Äôs best. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the best paces to buy a bottle is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Casa del Tequila</ENAMEX> in downtown <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Vallarta</ENAMEX>. They regularly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> samplings, serve up the best margaritas on the coast, and provide free informational pamphlets (in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX>) on the history, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">types</ENAMEX>, and lore of tequila. (Also see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">93</NUMEX>.)
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Escondido</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Huatulco</ENAMEX>, you‚Äôll find an abundance of tequila‚Äôs close <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cousin</ENAMEX>, mezcal. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mezcal</ENAMEX> is distilled from the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">juice</ENAMEX> of more common types of maguey <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> found in the central <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region of Mexico</ENAMEX>. It has a stronger taste and smell than tequila. Oaxacan mezcal is the type that is bottled with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">maguey worm</ENAMEX> pickled in the bottom of the bottle. To the ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexicans</ENAMEX>, the maguey <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> was considered sacred, and the fact that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worm</ENAMEX> had ingested a part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúspirit‚Äù</ENAMEX> of this revered <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> made consuming them both a delicacy and a way to obtain good luck. Salud!

Notable among the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">galleries</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Galer√≠a Pac√≠fico</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tel</ENAMEX>. (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">222-1982</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Galer√≠a Rosas Blanca</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tel</ENAMEX>.

(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">221-1985</ENAMEX>), in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Marina Vallarta</ENAMEX>. It is important to note that original art is duty free in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> and many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>, and that most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">galleries</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> in packing, shipping, and handling.
During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the winter months</TIMEX>, the various <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">galleries</ENAMEX>, that number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than a dozen</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> free art walks. These events showcase featured <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists‚</ENAMEX>Äô works, and are also an integral part of the local social scene.. The large presence of both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">galleries</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> have positioned <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Vallarta</ENAMEX> as a leading art <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>, the site of the largest selection of fine contemporary <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> art outside of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico City</ENAMEX>.
Huichol art. You won‚Äôt find any other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> with as much original <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Huichol</ENAMEX> art as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Vallarta</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Huichol</ENAMEX> are one of the last remaining indigenous cultures that has been successful in retaining cultural integrity¬<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">†‚Äî¬†¬†despite</ENAMEX> efforts by the ‚Äúcivilized‚Äù world to westernize their traditional ways of living. Because their land, located in remote areas of the high <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sierra Madre</ENAMEX> mountains, has diminished in productivity, they can no longer produce enough for self-sufficiency, and have been forced to look for supplemental forms of income. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of these is by selling their art.
Huichol art is vibrant, full of symbolism, and is generally created as a result of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">spiritual ‚Äúvision</ENAMEX>.‚Äù There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> main forms of this art. Yarn paintings are created on a wooden base covered with wax; colorful threads are pressed into the wax to form designs that are symbolic representations of the world of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Huichol</ENAMEX>. Beaded <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pieces</ENAMEX> are made in the same manner, by pressing tiny beads into carved wooden pieces that are coated in wax. The designs are called chaquira, and their different <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> and symbols give meaning to the piece.
You can also find <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Huichol</ENAMEX> ceremonial and everyday life artifacts for sale at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">galleries</ENAMEX> that specialize in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Huichol</ENAMEX> art. As a rule, none of the objects offered for sale¬†‚Äî¬†especially those deemed ceremonial, such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Muvieris</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marakame</ENAMEX> hats and chairs¬†‚Äî¬†have been used in actual ceremonies. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Huichol</ENAMEX> culture it is considered a sacrilege to commercialize sacred <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Visitors</ENAMEX> should be aware of this and respect their culture by not attempting to purchase sacred or ceremonial pieces.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Children</ENAMEX> enjoy boat rides and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bay cruises</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glass</ENAMEX>-bottom boat ride in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Acapulco</ENAMEX> seems to be one that they find the most fun. Boat rides in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Vallarta‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bay of Banderas</ENAMEX> include the added excitement of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sighting dolphins</ENAMEX>, mantas, and, depending on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the season</TIMEX>, even <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">whales</ENAMEX>.
There are several waterparks: In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Acapulco</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CICI</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Centro Internacional de Convivencia Infantil</ENAMEX>), across from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Convention Center</ENAMEX>, offers <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> of fun with waterslides, a water <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> for toddlers, a fresh-water <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pool</ENAMEX> with waves, plus a dolphin and seal show, all included in the entrance fee of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">around US$4</NUMEX>.

Acapulco‚Äôs public <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parque Papagayo</ENAMEX> is a good option for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a day</TIMEX> away from the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>. It has a small amusement <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>, an aviary, a replica of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbus‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX>, and paddleboats for cruising the park‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX>. Another favorite with the younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Amazing World</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Gran Plaza</ENAMEX>. Here for one admission fee, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> can enjoy slides, chutes, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tunnels</ENAMEX>, a ball-filled pool, and video games.
