<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> and
The Athenians
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> ention the name <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> and almost everyone will have some preconceived ideas about the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Socrates</ENAMEX> painted a picture with words in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fourth century</TIMEX> b.c., <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pausanais</ENAMEX> during the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> era. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 20th century</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX> added its own slant to the legends, and every school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> learns about the gods of the ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">worldÂ â€”Â of Zeus</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Athena</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apollo</ENAMEX>.
The most important <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> in the world during its heyday in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fifth and fourth centuries b.c.</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> were highly sophisticated in their thoughts and actions, their tastes and fashions. This small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> set on and around a dramatic hill of rockÂ<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE"> â€”Â the AcropolisÂ â€”Â</ENAMEX> became the cradle of western civilization. From the public meetings held here the concepts of citizenship, democracy, and debate developed. Through their regard for learning, history and science were first codified and organized. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Athenian</ENAMEX> love of leisure allowed the development of numerous pursuits such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">theaterâ€‚â€”â€‚imagine</ENAMEX> a world without tragedy or comedy (without the ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Athenians</ENAMEX>, the much-loved TV soap opera might never have been possible). They also admired sporting prowess, inaugurating the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Olympic Games</ENAMEX> where the best in the world would compete together simply for the glory of winning. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Athenians</ENAMEX> left an enduring legacy of concepts and ideas for humankind but they also bequeathed a remarkable number of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> and artifacts that tell us about their lives. The remains of the temples of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acropolis</ENAMEX> are recognized worldwide and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of statues, along with ordinary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">household</ENAMEX> pottery, jewelry, and tools hold a fascination for anyone who enjoys exploring the past.
However, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> is more than a sum of these ancient parts. Though it disappeared from the record books following the decline of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roman Empire</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX> centuryÂ<ENAMEX TYPE="GAME"> â€”Â its</ENAMEX> lineage and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">magnificent monuments unappreciatedÂ â€”Â it</ENAMEX> has risen like a phoenix from the ashes since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1834</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> that it became capital of the modern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX>. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grand</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> were erected to mark its re-birth. Though Neo-Classical design was fashionable everywhere in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-19th century</TIMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> it echoed that of the original monuments of the ancient cityÂ<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL"> â€”Â it</ENAMEX> was, in a sense, returning home. The elegant simplicity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parliament</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>, graceful faÃ§ade of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University</ENAMEX>, and almost â€˜Rococo-esqueâ€™ decoration on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Academy</ENAMEX> all hark back to ancient antecedents. Each was built with marble hewn from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pentelic Hills</ENAMEX> just as those erected in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> at the time of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Socrates</ENAMEX>. 
But there was a downside to this sudden re-emergence to center stage. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> were drawn to the new capital like <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX> to a honey-pot, and throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th century</TIMEX> the dispossessed of the economically floundering <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Aegean</ENAMEX> islands flocked here to find work. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1920s</TIMEX> in the aftermath of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WWII</ENAMEX> and the fall of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottoman Empire</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Turkey</ENAMEX> agreed on a mass <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> swap, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greeks</ENAMEX> whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> had lived in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asia Minor</ENAMEX> (on the western <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> coast) for generations, found themselves homeless in their spiritual <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">homeland</ENAMEX>. Athens strained to accommodate many of them and a rash of building work saw the erection of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> faceless utilitarian suburbs that now surround the downtown area. Since <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> were kept low-rise in an attempt to make them earthquake proof, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> began to spread outwards across the olive <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">groves</ENAMEX> of nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">valleys</ENAMEX>. Not one of the worldâ€™s prettiest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>, its preponderance for concrete can give it a drab and shabby look even on the brightest of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>.
In the latter <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years of the 20th century</TIMEX> very little was done to improve matters. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> grew but the infrastructure was not developed, resulting in gridlock of the urban traffic system, smog, and noise pollution. Today, at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> glance nothing seems to have changed. A brown layer of pollution hangs over the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> in both hot and cold weather; the seemingly endless hooting of horns down the wide boulevards and the drone of vehicles making painfully slow progress through the narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> raises noise levels; and in a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> with so many <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartments</ENAMEX> and so little parking itâ€™s no surprise that <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sidewalks</ENAMEX> become places to leave your <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicle</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pedestrians</ENAMEX> must risk life and limb by walking on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX>. 
Perhaps this picture seems a little bleak, but there is one positive factor that eases the concern about visiting <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Itâ€™s</ENAMEX> so easy to escape the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> completely that one neednâ€™t feel trapped by the urban environment. Within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an hour</TIMEX> of being at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Syntagma Square</ENAMEX> outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Parliament</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> (the symbolic heart of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>), you could easily be sitting at the quayside of some small <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> island having a cooling <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drink</ENAMEX>, or enjoying the pine forest of the countryside of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">AtticaÂ â€”Â the region</ENAMEX> that surrounds the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX>. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Athenians</ENAMEX> understand this. They are not daunted or downhearted by their surroundings, they enjoy their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, revelling in the opportunities it gives them. Every <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">district</ENAMEX> has its own small squares with cafÃ©s, where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> gather for a drink or mealÂ<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE"> â€”Â and Athenians</ENAMEX> love to eat out. Youâ€™ll be surprised at the wealth of good <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> offering international cuisine, and how much post-modernist dÃ©cor influences interior design in the smarter <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">districts</ENAMEX>. Of course the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> taverna hasnâ€™t become extinct. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Locals</ENAMEX> as much as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> enjoy the fresh and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">delicious cuisine thatâ</ENAMEX>€™s been served in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> theater is thriving at new auditoria such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Megaron</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>, or at the open-air <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">theaters</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lycabettus Hill</ENAMEX>. The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Athens Festival</ENAMEX> has a full program of music, dance, and poetry with a rich historical legacy. Sports are still avidly followed, though <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> itâ€™s more likely to be football, not a discus throw, that excites the emotions. Powerboat racing out on the waters of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Saronic Gulf</ENAMEX> also raises the adrenalin of the wealthy.
Tradition still plays an important part in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> life here. The family forms the backbone of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> society and filial ties are strong. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Children</ENAMEX> play safely in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> with grandma keeping a watchful eye. New <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">babies</ENAMEX> are proudly shown to the world in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the evening</TIMEX> volta or stroll, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> come to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â</NUMEX>€œbill and coo.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€ Families</ENAMEX> gather for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a weekend</TIMEX> meal, taking over a corner of a taverna to spend <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a couple of hours</TIMEX> in noisy debate (some may say argument) while perhaps having a little <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX>. Eating always takes <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> place to conversation at a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meal</ENAMEX>. Greek hospitality is warm and genuineÂ â€”Â even small examples such as always being welcomed with a smile and shown to your <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">seats</ENAMEX> at a taverna. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Shopkeepers</ENAMEX> are skilled <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">salesmen</ENAMEX>, but never pushy or overbearing. 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Orthodox ChurchÂ</ENAMEX> â€”â€‚for so long the one thing that united the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hellenic Diasporaâ€‚â€”Â still</ENAMEX> has a strong influence on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. Everyone from suited <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">businessmen</ENAMEX> to young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX> on national service make a regular visit to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Athens Cathedral</ENAMEX> or a small local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> to light a candle. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> stop in on the way <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> from work or in their lunch breaks; itâ€™s such a normal part of everyday life here. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> language also unifiesâ€‚the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">congregation</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clergy</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greeks</ENAMEX> around the world, though its use gives the capital a decidedly exotic air as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> struggle to make sense of these â€œforeignâ€ letters. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thereâ€™s</ENAMEX> also a sense of patriotism and national pride here even among the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">youngÂ â€”Â perhaps</ENAMEX> brought about by political upheavals in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 20th century</TIMEX>. Since <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> democracy was restored in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1975</TIMEX>, after the military <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">dictatorship</ENAMEX>, it is as though the population relish their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> all the more.
However, since joining the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Union</ENAMEX> (then the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Common Market</ENAMEX>) in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1981</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX> has definitely moved closer to her western <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cousins</ENAMEX>, being one of the first wave of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> to join the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Euro</ENAMEX> currency zone. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> has done well out of her <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">union</ENAMEX>, receiving <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">billions of dollars</NUMEX> in aid, which has been used to upgrade vital road links throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. Though the economy is still troubled, you are just as likely to see mobile phones as worry beads in a manâ€™s hand, and the young wear the latest <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> fashions just as the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italians</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> do. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tourism</ENAMEX> also continues to flourish at the dawn of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 21st century</TIMEX>. It is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Greeceâ</ENAMEX>€™s major foreign currency earner with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> visiting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every year</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> is an international melting pot with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of many nationalities treading the marble steps of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acropolis</ENAMEX> to gaze at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">birthplace</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Western</ENAMEX> civilization. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Olympic Games</ENAMEX>, first held in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX> during ancient times, will return to the capital giving <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> the chance to stand in the limelight again. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> offers some of the most fascinating and alluring archaeological remains in the world, yet those who visit in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 21st century</TIMEX> find that the modern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> works hard to live up to the past.
