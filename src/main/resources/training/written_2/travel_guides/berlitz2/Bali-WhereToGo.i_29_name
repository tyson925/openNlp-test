Where to Go
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bali</ENAMEX> is not a large <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX>: you can easily get to any place on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bali</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">several hours</TIMEX>. But to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Balinese</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> is their universe‚Äîa world unto itself. You will cut traveling time and get to know different areas of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bali</ENAMEX> in depth if you make overnight stays or visits of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few days</TIMEX> in each of the island‚Äôs regions.
Don‚Äôt expect‚Äîand don‚Äôt even try‚Äîto rush around seeing all the temples and other cultural attractions on the island, or all those mentioned in this section. The island scenery and fleeting glimpses of everyday life are just as rewarding. Best of all is to turn a corner and find a procession, perhaps the whole <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX>, dressed in their best and blocking the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>. Balinese temples, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palaces</ENAMEX>, and other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>, however exotic or exquisite, only really come to life when filled with ceremonies and the bustle of festivals. We have selected some of the most interesting and important attractions, but to truly appreciate and absorb what you see, we suggest that you take a few at a time.
Start as soon after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">dawn</TIMEX> as possible, when it‚Äôs cool and the light is better for photography. A prompt start also gives you extra time to reach the more remote areas.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern Resorts</ENAMEX>
Most of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bali‚Äôs</ENAMEX> tourism is concentrated in a tiny fraction of the island, with the vast majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> heading for the ‚Äúbig three‚Äù beaches, namely <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sanur</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuta</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nusa Dua</ENAMEX>, all within a short drive of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX>. Some stretches of sand are so magnificent and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> so warm, it‚Äôs hard to believe that they were ignored for so long by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Balinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, who have traditionally turned away from the sea. Now <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> come in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> from all over the world with little in mind but sun, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sand</ENAMEX>, warm seas, and watersports.
Sanur
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Southeast</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Denpasar, Bali‚</ENAMEX>Äôs capital, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sanur</ENAMEX> is where the first modern tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> stories high, was built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s</TIMEX>. Fortunately, no other high-rise <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> have been built on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Bali‚Äîthe</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> decreed that in the future no <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> should be higher than a palm <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>.
In atmosphere, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sanur</ENAMEX> falls somewhere between the brash, noisy <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kuta</ENAMEX> and secluded, pricey <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nusa Dua</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Half</NUMEX>-hidden by tropical <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">gardens</ENAMEX> and foliage, many of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sanur‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> are small in scale, and face the pleasant, sandy beach. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> is generally calm, protected from waves and undercurrents by an outlying coral reef. At high tide, the swimming is wonderful, but at low tide, the water dips to knee or waist level, and wading is the only activity possible. Beyond the reef are massive pounding waves, a challenge for experienced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">surfers</ENAMEX>.
Just inland, parallel to the beach, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sanur</ENAMEX> looks at first like nothing more than a long strip of souvenir <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, clothing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boutiques</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>. But take a walk along some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> leading off the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jalan Tanjung Sari</ENAMEX>, or beyond the impatient traffic of the bypass (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jalan Bypass</ENAMEX>) and you‚Äôll find traditional life still going on as if tourism had never happened. Many small <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indonesian</ENAMEX> and seafood <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> are pleasant; one or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> are outstanding. Sanur <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> provide the best top-bracket dining.
Only a short walk north along the shore from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX>-story <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grand Bali Beach Hotel</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Le Mayeur Museum</ENAMEX>, once the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Belgian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painter</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adrien Jean Le Mayeur</ENAMEX>. He came to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bali</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1932</TIMEX> and stayed to marry the beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ni Pollok</ENAMEX>, who had been a well-known <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">legong dancer</ENAMEX> (see page¬<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">†88</NUMEX>) before retiring (at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>!) to teach dance. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">its day</TIMEX>, the garden with its ponds and statues was open on the seaward side; now it is fully enclosed. The outside of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> is covered with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stone carvings</ENAMEX> while the interior is a gallery of sculpture collected by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Le Mayeur</ENAMEX>. The walls are hung with his own paintings: <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> landscapes, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Balinese</ENAMEX> scenes, and studies of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dancers</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ni Pollok</ENAMEX>. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Le Mayeur</ENAMEX> died in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1958</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> was turned into a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> that his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">widow</ENAMEX> ran until her death in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1985</TIMEX>.
Near the small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">harbor</ENAMEX> at this end of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sanur Beach</ENAMEX> you can find motorized <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">prahu</ENAMEX> (outrigger <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX>) to take you to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nusa Lembongan</ENAMEX>, an island 17¬†km (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">11¬†miles</NUMEX>) offshore to the east, which is noted for its good surfing and snorkeling.
At the southern end of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sanur Beach</ENAMEX>, near the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sanur Beach Hotel</ENAMEX>, the signs point to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pura Belanjong</ENAMEX>. It‚Äôs only a short walk, but few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> find their way to this old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX>, deserted unless there‚Äôs a ceremony. A stone pillar, now set in a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pit</ENAMEX> and protected by railings, bears an inscription said to date from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">a.d.¬†913</ENAMEX>, but as it is normally wrapped in cloth you‚Äôre unlikely to see it.
Kuta
The most famous stretch of beach in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bali</ENAMEX> forms the western shore of a narrow neck of land just north of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX>. After <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">travelers</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s</TIMEX> discovered that they could enjoy a back-to-nature existence here at minimal cost, they gathered in ever-increasing numbers. Tales were told in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australia</ENAMEX> about the ‚Äúperfect wave,‚Äù and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kuta</ENAMEX> became the dream destination for every surfer. Once a poor fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> and wasteland believed to be inhabited by bad <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spirits</ENAMEX>, by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1980s</TIMEX> it was transformed into a frenetic scene, fueled by plenty of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> and, for a while, illegal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>. The height limit was virtually the only regulation applied to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>, and a sprawling <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">shantytown</ENAMEX> soon sprang up. Theft and prostitution (chiefly blamed on incomers from the other islands) looked as if they were becoming endemic. On and off the beach, every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreigner</ENAMEX> was plagued by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hawkers</ENAMEX> as adhesive as <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bush flies</ENAMEX>. 
Eventually, voices were heard at banjar meetings urging a clean-up and the raising of standards. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> Kuta has gone a long way toward putting its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> right. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Drugs</ENAMEX> have largely disappeared and crime rates are down, although you still need to beware of pickpockets and shouldn‚Äôt leave property unguarded. Traffic, however, remains <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kuta‚</ENAMEX>Äôs nightmare.
Kuta, and its progressively upscale <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> to the north ‚Äî <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legian, Seminyak</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kerobokan</ENAMEX> (as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tuban</ENAMEX>, to the south) ‚Äî provide an enormous selection of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pubs</ENAMEX>, and shopping choices. In all price ranges, you‚Äôll find some of the best <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vegetarian</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asian</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> on the island, as well as some of the best <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> for crafts from other islands, fashion, locally produced ikat cloth, and casual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bali</ENAMEX>-style beach clothing. In keeping with its new image, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kuta</ENAMEX> has begun to acquire the trappings of a modern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, in the form of the multi-story <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Kuta Center</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Galleria</ENAMEX> shopping and leisure <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX>. Every <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gang</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">alley</ENAMEX>) is lined with moneychangers, clothing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bike</ENAMEX> rental <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>, all sorts of accommodations, and numerous bars and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>. 
The beach is the real reason to be here, and even though you won‚Äôt escape the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hawkers</ENAMEX>, it‚Äôs a rest cure after the bustle of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>. Swim only between the flags, where <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Australian</ENAMEX>-style <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lifeguards</ENAMEX> keep watch: the undertow and currents can be hazardous. Surf <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> abound. 
Towards sunset, a golden light reflects off the sea and local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> come out to stroll or paddle in the shallows. Young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> play <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">soccer</ENAMEX> on the sand or join the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> in a volleyball game, while the eager beach <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">masseuses</ENAMEX> rustle up a new wave of business.
At nightfall, new choices beckon. You can inspect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bali‚</ENAMEX>Äôs selection of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, pick a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX>, go on a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pub</ENAMEX> crawl, or see a movie and wait for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midnight</TIMEX> when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">discos</ENAMEX> get into gear.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kuta‚Äôs Neighbors</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuta Beach</ENAMEX> can mean the small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">area</ENAMEX> around the original <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX>, or the whole coast stretching from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX> north to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legian</ENAMEX> and beyond. Kuta‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> are developing separate identities. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tuban Beach</ENAMEX> to the south has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half a dozen</NUMEX> big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> and a waterpark with waterslides and a swimming pool, attracting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. The beach has calmer <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> are quieter; however, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">sea</ENAMEX> pollution can sometimes be a problem here. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adjoining Kuta</ENAMEX> to the north, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legian</ENAMEX> at first seems like more of the same, with a big concentration of places to eat, drink, dance, and sleep along <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Jalan Melasti</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jalan Padma</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jalan Legian</ENAMEX> itself. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sunrise</ENAMEX> is an idyllic time to be on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Legian Beach</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Surfers</ENAMEX> are out at the first light of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">dawn</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">runners</ENAMEX> pace the water‚Äôs edge. The farther north you go, the less congested the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> and the beach, until you can almost find yourself standing alone on the broad sands of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seminyak</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North</ENAMEX> again, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">surfers</ENAMEX> find their way to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canggu Beach</ENAMEX> by way of narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tracks</ENAMEX> through the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">fields</ENAMEX>. The final <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kilometer</NUMEX> or so is passable only by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">motorcycle</ENAMEX> or on foot.
Bukit Badung
Referred to simply as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bukit</ENAMEX> (or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äúthe hill‚Äù</ENAMEX>) by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Balinese</ENAMEX>, the peninsula south of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX> is almost a separate island. Most of it is a windswept limestone plateau, entirely unlike the rest of southern <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bali</ENAMEX>. Too dry for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX>, its rocky soil is used to grow <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beans</ENAMEX>, cassava, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peanuts</ENAMEX>. In the past, few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> lived here, and the only reason they might visit was to worship at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the temples and particularly at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Uluwatu</ENAMEX> on the cliffs at the western tip. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1980s</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> decided to develop an exclusive resort <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">zone</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nusa Dua</ENAMEX>, on the eastern side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Bukit</ENAMEX> peninsula. Another site on the peninsula, set aside for use by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bali</ENAMEX>, but also of interest to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX>, is the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park</ENAMEX>, at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ungasan, Jimbaran</ENAMEX>. Its centerpiece, currently under construction, will be an enormous statue of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Vishnu the Protector</ENAMEX> that will rival <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">New York‚Äôs Statue of Liberty</ENAMEX> in size.
At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nusa Dua</ENAMEX>, the outside world ‚Äî even the everyday <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Balinese</ENAMEX> world ‚Äî is excluded. The name, meaning ‚Äútwo islands,‚Äù refers to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> knobs of land sticking out from the coast in the middle of the reserve. They are not true islands but are each connected by a narrow neck of land. As at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sanur</ENAMEX>, when the tide is out, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> is too low for swimming, but most <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nusa Dua</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> have vast swimming <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pools</ENAMEX>. There‚Äôs little traffic or noise, and no hassle from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hawkers</ENAMEX> in this neatly manicured expensive hotel <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">zone</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">A dozen</NUMEX> luxury <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> sprawl amid spacious grounds next to dazzling white beaches, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> championship golf <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">convention center</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sheraton Nusa Indah Hotel</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Galleria</ENAMEX>, a modern shopping and restaurant <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> in the same area. Predictably, lower-priced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> and affordable eating places line <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 5¬†km</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3¬†miles</NUMEX>) of coast north of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nusa Dua‚Äôs</ENAMEX> hotel <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">zone</ENAMEX>, all the way to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Benoa</ENAMEX>. Once a dusty, somnolent fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Benoa</ENAMEX> has turned into a watersports center of buzzing jet skis, motorboats, diving <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bars</ENAMEX>.
Don‚Äôt confuse <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Benoa</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tanjung Benoa</ENAMEX>) with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Benoa Port</ENAMEX>, on the opposite (north) side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">muddy inlet</ENAMEX> known as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Benoa Harbor</ENAMEX>. Reached from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Sanur-Kuta</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> by a long causeway, the harbor is where cargo <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX> tie up. There is a charge for driving along the causeway to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">jetty</ENAMEX>, and no reason for going to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end</TIMEX> unless you plan to take the fast twin-hull, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maubua Express</ENAMEX> ferry to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lombok</ENAMEX>, a cruise to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nusa Lembongan</ENAMEX>, or a deep-sea fishing trip.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jimbaran Beach</ENAMEX> is a great arc of sand facing a sheltered bay south of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX>, shared by a handful of resort <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> and a fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX>. More <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> are rapidly going up on a new access <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> that runs parallel to the coast here. Look for the sign to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Uluwatu</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX> toward <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Nusa Dua¬†‚Äî¬†you</ENAMEX> have to pass it and then make a U-turn. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jimbaran Beach</ENAMEX> is famous for its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> that serve fresh grilled <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> and seafood on the beach. 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> across the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Bukit</ENAMEX> peninsula climbs past limestone quarries to a height of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">200¬†m</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">660¬†ft</NUMEX>) on its way to the western tip of land and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pura Luhur Uluwatu</ENAMEX>. All the way up the long flight of steps of this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX>, and especially near the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrines</ENAMEX>, you‚Äôll be eyed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkeys</ENAMEX> that are friendly, assuming they‚Äôve already been well fed. Bus tours converge on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Uluwatu</ENAMEX> toward sunset, and the romance of the place is somewhat spoiled.
Denpasar
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bali</ENAMEX> since the end of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War¬†II</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Denpasar</ENAMEX> was still a small market town <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">only 20¬†years ago</TIMEX>. Now <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> times the size, fueled by prosperity from the tourism boom, with all the government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> to match its status, it‚Äôs a noisy, polluted urban sprawl. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Rush hour</TIMEX> lasts <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">most of the day</TIMEX>, and when traffic lights change there‚Äôs a cavalry charge of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">motorcycles</ENAMEX> and scooters. In the middle of it all, the better-off live in traditional family <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">compounds¬†‚Äî¬†extra</ENAMEX>-high walls are the main concession to this kind of life. Those who have had to adapt to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX> living in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> can still have their family <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">temple¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†on the roof!
The most prominent central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">landmark</ENAMEX> is a big grey statue of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-faced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hindu god, Catur Muka</ENAMEX>, looking each way at the main intersection. The one-way system here sends traffic north up <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jalan Veteran</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Veteran Street</ENAMEX>) or east along <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Jalan Surapati</ENAMEX> which, after changes of name, becomes the road to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sanur</ENAMEX>. West of the intersection, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Jalan Gaja Mada</ENAMEX> is lined with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>. It soon meets <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jalan Sulawesi</ENAMEX> and then the dirty and often rather smelly <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Badung River</ENAMEX>. The city‚Äôs main fresh produce market, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pasar Badung</ENAMEX>, jams a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-story <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> and is open from before dawn until <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midday</TIMEX>. Just across the river is a similar building housing the handicraft and textile market, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pasar Kumbasari</ENAMEX>.
The colonial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bali Natour Hotel</ENAMEX> stands on both sides of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jalan Veteran</ENAMEX>. A little farther along on the left there‚Äôs another mar-ket, flowing out into the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">adjoining street</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">About 1¬†km</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1‚ÅÑ2¬†mile</NUMEX>) along <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Jalan Veteran</ENAMEX>, the bird market caters to the local liking for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">caged birds</ENAMEX>, from big hornbills to tiny songsters.
The big area of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">grass</ENAMEX> south of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jalan Surapati</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alun-alun Puputan</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puputan Square</ENAMEX>), site of the puputan or mass suicide in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1906</TIMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Raja of Badung‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> (see page¬<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">†19</NUMEX>).
At the farthest corner of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Puputan Square</ENAMEX>, you‚Äôll find the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bali Museum</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum Negeri Propinsi Bali</ENAMEX>). This interesting, but rather antiquated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> of ethnography, history, and art was created by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1910</TIMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> (fascinating in themselves) represent different styles of palace architecture. The main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> contains historical artifacts, ranging from a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2,200-year-old</TIMEX> stone sarcophagus to photographs of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1906</TIMEX> puputan; <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">upstairs</ENAMEX> is a collection of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day-to-day</TIMEX> and household items. The First <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Pavilion</ENAMEX>, designed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Singaraja</ENAMEX> style, displays antique <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Balinese</ENAMEX> textiles; the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Second Pavilion</ENAMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 18th century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Karangasaem</ENAMEX> style, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> religious and ceremonial objects; the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Third Pavilion</ENAMEX>, designed in the style of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tabanan Regency</ENAMEX>, displays artifacts used in music and dance, including a collection of masks, puppets, and costumes. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> is not strong on catalogues or labels; enjoy the displays for their own intrinsic beauty.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> adjoining the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> compound is the recently constructed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pura Jagatnata</ENAMEX>, built mainly out of white coral and dedicated to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sanghyang Widi</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme God</ENAMEX>. Of the many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hindu</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">gods</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trinity of Brahma, Vishnu</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shiva</ENAMEX> is considered to be pre-eminent, but a single god of whom all others are manifestations ties in conveniently with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indonesian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pancasila</ENAMEX>, or national code.
The tiny <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catholic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> attends <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Joseph‚Äôs Church</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jalan Kepundung</ENAMEX>, off <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jalan Surapati</ENAMEX>, a building thatched with palm <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">fronds</ENAMEX> and with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> distinctly <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Balinese</ENAMEX>-looking angels carved in stone standing above the door.
The imposing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arts Centre</ENAMEX>, in spacious gardens off <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jalan Nusa Indah</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abiankapas</ENAMEX>, some way out to the east, has a permanent exhibition of paintings and woodcarvings and an <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">arena</ENAMEX> for dance and drama. A major <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Arts Festival</ENAMEX> is held here <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every June and July</TIMEX>. Ask about chances to see <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dancers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">musicians</ENAMEX> practicing, as well as regular performances given for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>. You can also see dance nearby at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sekolah Tinggi Semi Indonesia</ENAMEX>, formerly the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indonesian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Academy of Dance</ENAMEX>, and still a dance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">academy</ENAMEX>.
Renon, in the southeast, is where most government <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> are gathered, including the main <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">post office</ENAMEX>, many consulates, and tourist information <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>. 
From <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Denpasar to Ubud: The Craft Villages</ENAMEX>
When the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">rajas</ENAMEX> ruled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bali</ENAMEX>, they organized the various crafts on a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> basis. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> would specialize in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wood</ENAMEX>-carving, another in weaving, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a third</NUMEX> in basketry. Passed down through each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, today those same skills are still practiced in the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX>. Along the busy <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> north from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Denpasar</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ubud</ENAMEX>, the various craft <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> have virtually merged into each other, but you can tell which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> you‚Äôre in by their products. 
A noisy traffic junction, the village of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Batubulan</ENAMEX> (moonstone) specializes in carving statues, friezes, and ornaments out of soft <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">grey paras stone</ENAMEX>. Easily shaped, it just as easily wears away, so outdoor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple decorations</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last only a few decades</TIMEX>, and there is a constant demand for replacements. Bug-eyed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">demons</ENAMEX> and tranquil heads of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buddha</ENAMEX>, each different, line the road and fill the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">yards</NUMEX> of the many workshops. Batubulan‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> is naturally a showcase. The barong dance (see page¬<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">†89</NUMEX>), staged every <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> here, is a totally commercial production attended by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">busloads</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Taman Barung Bali Bird Park</ENAMEX>, just north of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Batubulan</ENAMEX>, is a well-arranged exhibit of exotic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> and the famous <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indonesian</ENAMEX> Komodo <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dragon lizards</ENAMEX>.
Stop in nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sukawati</ENAMEX> for wind-chimes, puppets, basketry, ceremonial umbrellas, and jewelry. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stalls</ENAMEX> have been brought together in the big <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Art Market</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Celuk</ENAMEX> (pronounced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cheluk</ENAMEX>), between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ubud</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Denpasar</ENAMEX>, is a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of silversmiths and goldsmiths, their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> and workplaces line the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> and spill down every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gang</ENAMEX>. They can produce any style, from ornate pieces with semi-precious <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stones</ENAMEX> to delicate filigree work or modern designs. Tour buses make a regular stop at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">galleries</ENAMEX>, but prices should be lower down the small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX>.
Like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ubud, Batuan</ENAMEX> developed a distinctive painting style in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1930s</TIMEX> when Western techniques influenced the local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> (see page¬<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">†53</NUMEX>). Dark forest green and black predominate in the early <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Batuan</ENAMEX> pictures, relieved by flashes of white and amber. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> is still a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> for art: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painters</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> feature <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">surfers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">photographers</ENAMEX>, as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jeep</ENAMEX>-loads of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> among the massed figures in their pictures. The main <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pura Desa Batuan</ENAMEX>, is especially lavish in its carving decoration.
A short diversion eastwards will bring you to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blahbatuh</ENAMEX>, where the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace compound</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Puri Blahbatuh</ENAMEX>, has turned into a commercial orchid nursery, sometimes referred to as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Puri Anggrek</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Orchid Palace</ENAMEX>). 
Nearby, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Belega</ENAMEX> specializes in bamboo, producing massive pieces of furniture. You‚Äôll see them on display along the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>, and also in some of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bali‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX>. Then comes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bona</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> of basketry which also bills itself as the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">home</ENAMEX> of the kecak dance. The regular performances here are certainly more complete than most versions.
Back on the road to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ubud</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mas</ENAMEX> is famous for its woodcarvers, furniture <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">makers</ENAMEX>, and mask-carvers. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Vast</ENAMEX> numbers of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> and workshops line the long main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>. Unless a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop</ENAMEX> has been specifically recommended, just stop anywhere and look inside, without buying right away. Then investigate the side <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>. Away from the traffic, you might find an entire family producing wooden hangings for the export market.
Ubud
Once a magnet for foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> and still home to some, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ubud</ENAMEX> and the cluster of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> around it form the cultural and artistic focus of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bali</ENAMEX>. An increasing number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> come on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX> trips from the coastal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX>, but a better plan is to stay overnight or longer. There‚Äôs a wide choice of accommodations, ranging from cheap homestays and charming middle range <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> to high-priced luxury <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">hideaways</ENAMEX> in the countryside just outside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ubud</ENAMEX>.
Day trippers only get to see the commercialism and chaos in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ubud‚</ENAMEX>Äôs main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>. Just a short walk away, however, you‚Äôre among the green, peaceful <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice terraces</ENAMEX> and jungle-filled river gorges that have captivated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bali‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX> and are so much a part of the region‚Äôs legendary mystique. 
For schedules of dance performances and other events in the vicinity, pay an early visit to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bina Wisata</ENAMEX> information <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jalan Raya</ENAMEX>. Excellent, very inexpensive performances of traditional dance are offered in the atmospheric compound beside the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> in the center of town. In addition to its many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, markets, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">galleries</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ubud</ENAMEX> is home to a number of interesting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum Puri Lukisan</ENAMEX> is reached by a gateway across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> from the tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jalan Raya</ENAMEX>. In lush gardens, a fine <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX> has been built to house the works from the collection of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painter</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rudolf Bonnet</ENAMEX>, who helped guide the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pita</ENAMEX> Maha art movement in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1930s</TIMEX>, and from the collection of his patron, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cokorda Gde Agung Sukawati</ENAMEX>, who governed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ubud</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many decades</TIMEX>. Look for the work of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">I¬†Gusti Nyoman Lempad</ENAMEX>, one of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> to adopt Western techniques and bring the flat wayang figures of traditional painting to life. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Remarkably</ENAMEX>, he was probably over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50 years old</TIMEX> when he met <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter Spies</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bonnet</ENAMEX> (see page¬<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">†53</NUMEX>). Even he did not know his exact age. The museum‚Äôs estimate that he died in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1978</TIMEX> at the age of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">115</NUMEX> may be an exaggeration. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">I¬†Gusti Nyoman Lempad</ENAMEX> was chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX> and sculptor to the ruling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sukawati</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ubud</ENAMEX>, and designed the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pura</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Saraswati</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX>, with its beautiful lotus pond and water garden, on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jalan Raya</ENAMEX>.
The superb <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum Neka</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">11‚ÅÑ2¬†miles</NUMEX>) out of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> to the north of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campuhan</ENAMEX>, was founded by a local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">collector</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Suteja Neka</ENAMEX>. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">galleries</ENAMEX> you can see the work of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Europeans</ENAMEX> who were so influential, as well as that of the finest local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX>.
Some of the most striking pictures are by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indonesians</ENAMEX> working in a purely Western idiom. While others were creating new <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Balinese</ENAMEX> styles, they wholeheartedly adopted <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Western</ENAMEX> ways: Only in their subject matter do these so-called <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚ÄúAcademic painters‚Äù</ENAMEX> reveal their origins. Look for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dullah‚</ENAMEX>Äôs portraits, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mutual Attraction</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abdul Aziz</ENAMEX>, where the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">figures</ENAMEX> seem to be leaning out of their frames. A photo gallery features prints of dance and everyday life in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bali</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1930s</TIMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Senawati Gallery of Art</ENAMEX> By <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Women</ENAMEX>, on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jalan Sriwedari</ENAMEX>, off <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jalan Rayal</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ubud</ENAMEX>, houses a very worthwhile collection of paintings by local and expatriate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women artists</ENAMEX>, as well as a gallery that promotes the sale of their work. Other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">galleries</ENAMEX> to visit include those of long-term <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Ubud</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Antonio Blanco</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catalan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX> noted for erotic subject matter, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hans Snel</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX> whose highly praised work is displayed in a gallery adjacent to his guesthouse.
Near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ubud</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North</ENAMEX>
At the western end of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, an old suspension bridge and a new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road bridge</ENAMEX> cross the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campuhan</ENAMEX> river. On the north side of the ravine is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pura Gunung Labah</ENAMEX>, which may date from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 8th century</TIMEX> a.d., possibly making it one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bali‚</ENAMEX>Äôs earliest. Shrouded in dense vegetation, it overlooks <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goa Raksasa</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cave</ENAMEX> named after the evil <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">giant</ENAMEX> who is said to have dwelt there.
Just north of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Campuhan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridges</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tjampuhan Hotel</ENAMEX> (the same place-name but with the old spelling) <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stands</ENAMEX> where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter Spies</ENAMEX> (see page¬<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">†53</NUMEX>) came to live in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1930s</TIMEX>. Across the road and up the hill, stone stairs lead to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice paddies</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">track</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">home</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Young Artists</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Penestanan</ENAMEX>. At neighboring <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sayan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Westerners</ENAMEX> have built their homes overlooking the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice terraces</ENAMEX> and spectacular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Ayung</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">gorge</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Campuhan</ENAMEX> past the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum Neka</ENAMEX> leads to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kedewatan</ENAMEX>, where the most luxurious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> in the area compete to offer similarly stunning views into the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ayung valley</ENAMEX>. Beyond <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Payangan</ENAMEX>, the little-used road wends its way through scenic countryside all the way to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Batur</ENAMEX> (see page¬<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">†59</NUMEX>).
Try to be in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Petulu</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6¬†km</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4¬†miles</NUMEX>) north of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ubud</ENAMEX>, by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about 4pm</TIMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Every evening</TIMEX> at sunset, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of white <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">herons</ENAMEX> return from a day‚Äôs fishing in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice paddies</ENAMEX> and glide in to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">nest</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern Outskirts</ENAMEX> of Ubud
Off the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> near the information <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monkey Forest Road</ENAMEX> heads south past lines of homestays and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>. After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">almost 2¬†km</TIMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">just over 1¬†mile</TIMEX>) it reaches a small area of old <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">home</ENAMEX> of hordes of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">grey monkeys</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Don‚Äôt provoke them¬†‚Äî¬†a bite</ENAMEX> can be dangerous. A fee is charged for the doubtful privilege of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">visit¬†‚Äî¬†making monkeys</ENAMEX> out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> has been a local source of amusement and income for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peliatan</ENAMEX> is known for its dances and gamelan music as well as painting and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">carving¬†‚Äî¬†‚Äúparasite carvings‚Äù</ENAMEX> (see page¬<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">†92</NUMEX>) are a recent specialty. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agung Rai Gallery</ENAMEX> sells some of the best and most expensive modern <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Balinese</ENAMEX> paintings.
At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pengosekan</ENAMEX>, just a short walk farther south, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painters</ENAMEX> concentrate on images of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">butterflies</ENAMEX> in idyllic ‚ÄúGarden of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eden‚</ENAMEX>Äù landscapes. The recently opened <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agung Rai Museum of Art</ENAMEX> displays <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indonesian</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> paintings.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">East</ENAMEX> of Ubud
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bali‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most impressive archaeological finds are concentrated in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">areas</ENAMEX>: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> close to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ubud</ENAMEX>, another <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">roughly 13¬†km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">8¬†miles</NUMEX>) away to the northeast, near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tampaksiring</ENAMEX>.
Goa Gajah
Closest to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ubud</ENAMEX> is the so-called <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Elephant Cave</ENAMEX>, cut into the hillside below the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> just east of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Teges</ENAMEX>. It probably dates from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 10th century</TIMEX> a.d., but the whole site was buried beneath <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">volcanic ash</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mud</ENAMEX>. When the cave mouth was rediscovered in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1923</TIMEX>, the huge face carved around it was mistaken for an elephant‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> and the name has stuck. Inside the mouth, a passage measuring 12¬†m (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">39¬†ft</NUMEX>) long leads to a plain transverse chamber reaching <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">31‚ÅÑ2 m</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">11¬†ft</NUMEX>) wide, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20¬†m</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">66¬†ft</NUMEX>) long, and high enough to stand up in. Dim electric lights reveal niches at either end that are believed to have housed <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrines</ENAMEX>: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> now holds a damaged statue of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">elephant</ENAMEX>-headed god, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ganesha</ENAMEX>. 
Later excavations revealed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">an 11th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bathing pool</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terrace</ENAMEX> in front of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">cave</ENAMEX>, with fountains in the shape of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nymphs</ENAMEX> representing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">India‚</ENAMEX>Äôs great rivers. A fairly steep scramble down the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX> behind the pool leads to another cave with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> ancient statues of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buddha</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeh Pulu</ENAMEX>
Less <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">than1¬†km</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about 1‚ÅÑ2¬†mile</NUMEX>) east of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goa Gajah</ENAMEX>, look for a signpost to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeh Pulu</ENAMEX> pointing to the right, down a quiet village <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> soon ends, but a footpath continues through <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice terraces</ENAMEX> and past the local bathing pool. The rock face on the left of the path is carved in a series of scenes about 25¬†m (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">82¬†ft</NUMEX>) long. Quite different from the usual <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Balinese</ENAMEX> style, the simple, bold, and naturalistic figures include a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prince</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">servants</ENAMEX> out hunting wild boar with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> clinging to his <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horse</ENAMEX>. The carvings probably date from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 14th century</TIMEX> but, like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goa Gajah</ENAMEX>, the site was covered by mud and only excavated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1920s</TIMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeh Pulu</ENAMEX> and the village of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bedulu</ENAMEX>, the archaeological <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parbakala Gedong Arca</ENAMEX> brings together the neolithic and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bronze Age</ENAMEX> relics unearthed in this area, which include stone sarcophagi dating from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 500</NUMEX> b.c. The exhibits are neither well-organized nor labeled but, as this is also a study <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>, there may be someone knowledgeable on hand.
Several temples in the area are worth a short stop. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pura Kebo Edan</ENAMEX> has a statue of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">giant</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bima</ENAMEX>, standing 3¬†m (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10¬†ft</NUMEX>) tall, with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple penises</ENAMEX>, trampling on a copulating <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX>. A collection of ancient statuary includes some dating from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 13th century</TIMEX>. There‚Äôs more fine carved stonework at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 14th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pura Pusering Jagat</ENAMEX>, known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚ÄúTemple of the Navel of the World</ENAMEX>.‚Äù During a full moon, childless <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couples</ENAMEX> pray at the stone <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrines depicting lingam</ENAMEX> and yoni (male and female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genitalia</ENAMEX>).
At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pura Penataran Sasih</ENAMEX>, a great hollow bronze drum <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cast</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> piece and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11‚ÅÑ2¬†m</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5¬†ft</NUMEX>) across, stands high up on a platform at the back of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX>. The style is typical of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dong-son Bronze Age</ENAMEX> dynasty of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vietnam</ENAMEX> dating from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 300 b.c.</NUMEX>, but whether it was brought to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bali</ENAMEX> or made here is unknown. According to legend, it fell from the sky. A section was broken out of it at some time, and only the geometric patterns are visible from ground level: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Decoration</ENAMEX> not in view includes faces with staring eyes.
Tampaksiring
To the north of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pejeng Region</ENAMEX> the road climbs for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10¬†km</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">6¬†miles</NUMEX>) to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tampaksiring</ENAMEX>, where craft <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> compete to entice tour <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">buses</ENAMEX> to stop on their way to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Batur</ENAMEX> (see page¬<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">†59</NUMEX>). In <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the middle of the long</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">village street</ENAMEX>, look for a sign pointing down a road to the right to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gunung Kawi</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11‚ÅÑ2¬†km</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1¬†mile</NUMEX>) away. A long flight of steps descends into a valley lined by <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stalls</ENAMEX> selling bright sarongs, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carved coconut shells</ENAMEX>, and cold <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drinks</ENAMEX>. The drink <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendors</ENAMEX> can afford to be <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">patient¬†‚Äî¬†hot</ENAMEX>, thirsty, and tired <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> toiling back up are a captive market.
At the bottom of the steps, a narrow passage and gateway cut through solid rock opens out suddenly into the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">temple area</ENAMEX>. To the left, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> rows of hollows have been carved out of the cliffs on either side of a ravine. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Legend</ENAMEX> says they‚Äôre the marks of a giant‚Äôs fingernails, scraped out in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a single</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>. (The head of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">giant</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kebo Iwa</ENAMEX>, is carved out in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stone</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pura Gadun</ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Blahbatuh</ENAMEX>; see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX>.) The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rock Denpasar</ENAMEX> was sculpted so as to leave a candi (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shrine</ENAMEX>) measuring 7¬†m (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">23¬†ft</NUMEX>) in each hollow, believed to be some <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">memorials</ENAMEX> to a royal dynasty.
Not to be confused with the place <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gunung Kawi</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pura Gunung Kawi</ENAMEX> is some way away in the village of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sebatu</ENAMEX>, and often many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> asking for directions have been sent there by mistake. In fact, it is worth the trip, partly for the sights and scenery en route. From <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tampaksiring</ENAMEX> the road opposite the turning to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tirta Empul</ENAMEX> twists through <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> that specialize in the mass production of woodcarvings. You‚Äôll see rows of identical <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ducks</ENAMEX> alongside armies of chess pieces and perhaps some original new design of statue that hasn‚Äôt yet hit any of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> successive right turns, signposted, lead to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sebatu</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pura Gunung Kawi</ENAMEX>, a brightly painted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> with sacred springs feeding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> to ponds and bathing pools.
At the northern edge of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tampaksiring</ENAMEX>, the road forks right. Immediately on the left is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> and holy <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">spring</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tirta Empul</ENAMEX>, source of the river that flows through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gunung Kawi</ENAMEX>. It is believed to have been created by the god <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indra</ENAMEX> to revive his ailing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX>, whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> had been poisoned by an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enemy</ENAMEX>. He pierced the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">earth</ENAMEX>, and out flowed amerta, the water of immortality. It is still thought by many to have healing powers, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pools</ENAMEX> here are often thronged with those seeking purification. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> is situated against a wooded hillside, in contrast to the nearby souvenir <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, which are some of the less attractive in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bali</ENAMEX>. High above the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> stands a government rest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> built by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> and turned into a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> by the late <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sukarno</ENAMEX>, who they say kept a telescope trained on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">women‚Äôs pool</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eastern Bali</ENAMEX>
In contrast to the softer south, the mountain <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">slopes</ENAMEX> here reach down to the sea, creating rocky shores and small bays. Where there is sand, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">it‚Äôs grey</ENAMEX>, the result of the weathering of old lava. The rajas once ruled most of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bali</ENAMEX> from their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capitals</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Karangasem</ENAMEX> (now <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amlapura</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Klungkung</ENAMEX>. Approaching from the south, the road passes through busy <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Gianyar</ENAMEX>, also a former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">raja‚</ENAMEX>Äôs capital. The brick <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> in the center of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> is still the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">home</ENAMEX> of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> and is not open to the public. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weaving</ENAMEX> is the main industry, and a number of small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factories</ENAMEX> and some workshops along the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ubud</ENAMEX> are open for tours. Here you can learn about making ikat (endek in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Balinese</ENAMEX>), using threads that have been tie-dyed in bunches before weaving. 
Klungkung
The dynasty founded by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Batu Renggong</ENAMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dewa Agung</ENAMEX>, was paramount in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bali</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">300¬†years</TIMEX>, first ruling from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gelgel</ENAMEX> and then moving to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Klungkung</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1710</TIMEX>. Standing high above the modern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> where its broad main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> cross, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Kerta Gosa Pavilion</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Hall of Justice</ENAMEX>, was built at the time of the move and continued as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courthouse</ENAMEX> under the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX>. The ceiling is covered in vivid paintings in a style unique to the region. Although the paintings have frequently been restored and in fact entirely replaced more than once, the work has always been done by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> from the nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kamasan</ENAMEX>, and it is likely that the designs resemble <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 18th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">originals</ENAMEX>. Many of the panels relate tales from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Balinese</ENAMEX> mythology, but visitors‚Äô eyes tend to be drawn to the series depicting the dreadful punishments awaiting evildoers in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">kingdom</ENAMEX> of the dead.
Important <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guests</ENAMEX> were received in the exquisite <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bale Kambang</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pavilion</ENAMEX> surrounded by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> to give the appearance that it is floating among the water lilies. Its painted ceiling illustrates more lyrical stories from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Balinese</ENAMEX> legend. Facing the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace garden</ENAMEX>, a small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> has been opened in one of the old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>. Some of the most impressive exhibits are the photographs of the rajas and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>, dating from before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1908</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> of the puputan which took place in the open space in front of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> and marked the end of effective resistance to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> (see page¬<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">†19</NUMEX>). Across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>, a monument erected in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX> commemorates that tragic event.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">West of Klungkung</ENAMEX>, a narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lane</ENAMEX> leads to the village of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tihingan</ENAMEX>, one of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> places in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bali</ENAMEX> where the gongs for gamelan <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">orchestras</ENAMEX> are made. The other is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sawan</ENAMEX>, near the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">north coast</ENAMEX> (see page¬<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">†65</NUMEX>). In any of the bronze foundries, you‚Äôll find the same medieval scene, with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> apprentice pumping the bellows to keep a charcoal fire blazing while the smiths hammer away. Hanging mats keep the place in semi-darkness so that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> can judge the temperature of the glowing metal by its color. In the village of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Banda</ENAMEX>, about 5¬†km (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3¬†miles</NUMEX>) south of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tihinga</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> celebrates one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bali‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most successful contemporary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nyoman¬†Gunarsa.</ENAMEX>
On the eastern periphery of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Klungkung</ENAMEX> a bridge crosses the gorge of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Unda river</ENAMEX>, which is used as a big communal bath every <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> as the sun goes down. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ash</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mud</ENAMEX>, and floods from the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1963</TIMEX> eruption of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gunung Agung</ENAMEX> devastated this part of the island, and the effects are still felt <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, as its agriculture has not yet fully recovered from the disaster.
Goa Lawah
Considered one of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bali‚Äôs</ENAMEX> oddities, the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bat Cave</ENAMEX> and its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> are hemmed in by souvenir <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stalls</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hawkers</ENAMEX>, sash dispensers, donation <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">collectors</ENAMEX>, ticket <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sellers</ENAMEX>, and, for most of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX>, parked tour <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">buses</ENAMEX>. Once past this obstacle course, you‚Äôll see the cave mouth and a seething mass of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">leathery bats clinging</ENAMEX> to the rock face, here and there dropping off, circling and then coming in to land again. They can‚Äôt all find a place in the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">cave</ENAMEX>, so some hang outside in broad daylight. If you are staying anywhere near, perhaps at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Candi Dasa</ENAMEX>, you might time a visit here for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">dusk</TIMEX>. That‚Äôs when the bat <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX> pours out of the cave like a liquid black stream and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">wheels</ENAMEX> away into the distance to feed on the myriad <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX> of the tropical <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>. 
On the foreshore near the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bat Cave</ENAMEX>, a few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> scratch a living by harvesting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Seawater</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> concentrated by solar evaporation in shallow pans and then transferred to the hollowed-out <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">halves</NUMEX> of palm <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> trunks to crystallize.
Padangbai
This little port stands on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bali‚</ENAMEX>Äôs only natural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">harbor</ENAMEX> with an unobstructed approach from the sea. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX> dropped anchor in the sheltered bay in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1597</TIMEX> (see page¬<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">†14</NUMEX>). Today‚Äôs cruise <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX> usually do the same, and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> are ferried ashore for sightseeing excursions.
A regular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passenger</ENAMEX> and car ferry makes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two or three</NUMEX> sailings per day to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lombok</ENAMEX>. The voyage can be rough and may take longer than the scheduled <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">four hours</TIMEX>. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> opt for the newer, faster, and more expensive twin-hull <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mabua Express</ENAMEX> ferry from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Benoa Port</ENAMEX> (see page¬<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">†75</NUMEX>), but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">backpackers</ENAMEX> and most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locals</ENAMEX> prefer this traditional, albeit less comfortable, route. Fishermen land their catches at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Padangbai‚</ENAMEX>Äôs small busy beach, which is jammed with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX>, just to the north of the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">jetty</ENAMEX>. Facing it at the far end are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two or three</NUMEX> simple but adequate cottage-style homestays. You can arrange diving or fishing trips here, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> in the bay looks too dirty for swimming.
Beyond <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Padangbai</ENAMEX> comes the broad sweep of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Amuk Bay</ENAMEX>, site of a controversial new oil <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terminal</ENAMEX>. At its eastern end, after the coast road crosses an iron <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX>, a track leads down to the sea at the village of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buitan</ENAMEX>, also called <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Balina Beach</ENAMEX>, the name of its main <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX> and SCUBA-diving <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Candi Dasa</ENAMEX> (pronounced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chandi Dasa</ENAMEX>)
Cottage-style <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> and homestays began to be built along this stretch of coast in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 1970s</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> in search of more quiet than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kuta</ENAMEX> and lower prices than at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sanur</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nusa Dua</ENAMEX> liked the easy-going atmosphere, the beach of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">grey volcanic sand</ENAMEX>, and snorkeling over the reef. But in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1980s</TIMEX> the coral reef was mined and destroyed for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cement</ENAMEX> to build new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX>, the beach it had protected was washed away, and the shoreline quickly eroded. In an attempt to stem the loss, ugly <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">jetties</ENAMEX> were built, and a network of concrete blocks was planted into the sea. The erosion has been stopped, but probably not reversed. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">There‚Äôs</ENAMEX> still some dark sand exposed during low tide, mixed with broken coral, so it is advisable to wear shoes if you want to swim in the sea. If nothing else, the beach erosion has helped to keep <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Candi Dasa</ENAMEX> a quiet place, well-stocked with hotel <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX>; it has also halted plans that would have led to even more development.
In an island of varied <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tenganan</ENAMEX> is one of the strangest. From <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Candi Dasa</ENAMEX>, it is 4¬†km (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">21‚ÅÑ2¬†miles</NUMEX>) inland, on the lower slopes of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mount Agung</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> there are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bali Aga, ‚Äúoriginal Balinese,‚Äù</ENAMEX> and many of their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">customs</ENAMEX> and rituals date from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the animist days</TIMEX> before the advent of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hinduism</ENAMEX>. They have their own music and dances. Marriage outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> used to be forbidden, and the population shrank. Once the rule was eased, the downsizing trend halted.
The rough <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> from the coast terminates at a parking <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">area</ENAMEX> outside the village walls, where you are asked to make a donation before entering. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> long street climbs up from the main gateway, past a succession of open-sided pavilions and up cobblestoned terraces. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX> it becomes a continuous market, with some unusually chatty, cheerful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shopkeepers</ENAMEX>. The weavers of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tenganan</ENAMEX> are well known for making grinsing (or gerinsing) cloth, a double ikat (see page¬<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">†93</NUMEX>) in which both warp and weft threads are tie-dyed in bunches before weaving. The intricacy of the process of lining up the patterns can only be imagined: It takes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> to make a sarong and prices are high. You‚Äôll see a lot of cloth that is fake¬<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">†‚Äî¬†the genuine item</ENAMEX> is rare.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amlapura</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Karangasem</ENAMEX>)
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North of Candi Dasa</ENAMEX> the road turns inland, crossing hills and fertile valleys, with views of the volcanic cone of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gunung Agung</ENAMEX>. Amlapura was known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Karangasem</ENAMEX> before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1963</TIMEX>. That is still the name of the region, but its capital wanted to erase the memory of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mount Agung‚</ENAMEX>Äôs eruption and perhaps to confuse any evil <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spirits</ENAMEX> who might still want to destroy the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Karangasem</ENAMEX>. Part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">raja‚Äôs palace</ENAMEX> and gardens were damaged then, but there has been some restoration, and one of three <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palaces</ENAMEX> at the site, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Puri Agung</ENAMEX>, is open to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>.
The last raja fancied his talents as an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX> and built <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> rather elaborate water gardens. Ujung on the coast was built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1920s</TIMEX>. It was devastated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1963</TIMEX> but some of its gateways, pavilions, terraces, and its weed-choked pool still stand, forlorn and deserted, like the relics of some far more ancient civilization.
From <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ujung</ENAMEX>, a coast road skirts the eastern tip of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bali</ENAMEX>, but it is potholed and crosses many river beds, usually dry but impassable after heavy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rain</ENAMEX>. The scenery is not varied enough to make the bumpy <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two-hour</TIMEX> ride to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amed</ENAMEX> worth the effort. There‚Äôs a much more beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alternative¬†‚Äî¬†taking</ENAMEX> in the raja‚Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> fancy creation, the water <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">playground</ENAMEX> in the hills at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tirtagangga</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5¬†km</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3¬†miles</NUMEX>) northwest of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amlapura</ENAMEX>. This water <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garden</ENAMEX> was only established after <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX>, and despite being <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">nearer</NUMEX> to the eruption, it was spared serious damage. You can cool off in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the spring</TIMEX>-fed <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pools</ENAMEX> built for the raja‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, and there are places to stay if you want to enjoy the refreshing air and magical dawn light. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> losmen is inside the water <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garden area</ENAMEX>. 
On the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> north, a right fork at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Culik</ENAMEX> leads eastwards to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amed</ENAMEX>, a quiet fishing and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX>-panning village spread out along <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">several kilometers</NUMEX> of beaches. Here, many losmen (small, family-run <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX>), as well as a few pleasant middle-range <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> have sprung up to serve <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">travelers</ENAMEX> who come to snorkel and dive in the clear waters.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mountains</ENAMEX>
To the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Balinese</ENAMEX>, the mountains are the abode of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">gods</ENAMEX>, the source of the rivers that water their <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crops</ENAMEX>, and of occasional outbursts of destructive fury. The highest of them are active or dormant volcanoes: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gunung Batur</ENAMEX> simmers more or less continuously while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gunung Agung</ENAMEX> erupts violently once <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every few hundred years</TIMEX>. When you set out for the higher altitudes, be prepared for cold with damp mists, or for scorching sunshine.Either condition is possible. Many tour <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> run day trips, sometimes combining visits to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Besakih</ENAMEX> (see page¬<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">†60</NUMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Penelokan</ENAMEX> (see page¬<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">†58</NUMEX>). This is an easy way to see the views, but you will arrive at the same time as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of others. With more and more accommodations opening, think about overnighting at a mountain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX>, or an inexpensive guest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>. If you plan to climb one of the peaks¬†‚Äî¬†not a mountaineering feat but a few hours‚Äô or a full day‚Äôs hill walking and scrambling over <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">rocks¬†‚Äî¬†it‚Äôs</ENAMEX> essential to stay nearby and start early.
Bangli
On the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> from the south towards <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mount Batur</ENAMEX>, the chief <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of the former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rajadom</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bangli</ENAMEX> looks like a nursery for gorgeous flowering <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">shrubs</ENAMEX>. It comes alive <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every three days</TIMEX> for the big <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> market in the central <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>. To the south of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gianyar</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pura Dalem Penuggekan</ENAMEX>, a typical example of the many temples for the dead: Carved friezes show the nightmarish tortures awaiting sinners in the after-life. On the northern outskirts, the chief <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> of the former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rajadom</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bangli, Pura Kehen</ENAMEX>, comprises the typical <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> courtyards, here particularly large and linked by steep flights of steps. The walls of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> were once encrusted with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inset porcelain plates</ENAMEX>, but many have been broken or lost.
Around <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lake</ENAMEX> Batur
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX> from the south climb out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX> paddies of the lowlands, through <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plantations</ENAMEX> and orchards at around 600¬†m (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2,000¬†ft</NUMEX>), eventually thinning out into open pasture. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">band</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rainforest</ENAMEX> blocks out the view until you emerge at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1,300¬†m</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4,300¬†ft</NUMEX>) on the narrow rim of a huge crater (technically a caldera or collapsed volcano), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11¬†km</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">7¬†miles</NUMEX>) across and about 200¬†m (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">660¬†ft</NUMEX>) deep. The pastel blue crescent of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lake Batur</ENAMEX> takes up the eastern <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> of the great bowl, and out of the center grows <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mount Batur</ENAMEX> itself, bare rock streaked with black traces of old lava flows. Penelokan (‚ÄúPlace for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Looking‚Äù</ENAMEX>) can offer a great panorama, but it‚Äôs an ugly <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX>, at its worst when enveloped in a cold wet fog and you can‚Äôt see the view anyway. The peddlers here are the most aggressive in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bali</ENAMEX>: Balinese <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">travelers</ENAMEX> have complained about them since long before the arrival of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX>. The height of confusion comes at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">lunchtime</TIMEX> when the tour buses disgorge their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> especially built for them. Avoid the buffets which are often not fresh and notorious for making <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> ill.
There‚Äôs an even better view into the caldera, and no fuss, from the road a short way east from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Penelokan</ENAMEX> (heading towards <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Suter</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rendang</ENAMEX>, the turnoff for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Besakih</ENAMEX>).
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mount Batur</ENAMEX> went into an active phase in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 1994</TIMEX>, blowing huge puffs of smoke and rocky debris from a new vent on its northwest face. As a result, some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tracks</ENAMEX> there were cut. In addition, unsavory <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locals</ENAMEX> harass climbers. Only hikes accompanied by guides from the local guiding cooperative are advised. Travel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> elsewhere on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bali</ENAMEX> that specialize in nature/active tours can make arrangements for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hikers</ENAMEX>. A steep zig-zag road winds down to the lake: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bemos</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">motorcycle</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">jockeys</ENAMEX> are ready to take anyone without transport to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kedisan</ENAMEX>, a lakeside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> where you will find a few modest homestays.
On the lake‚Äôs western shore, reached by a road winding through lava fields, lies <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tirta</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Toyabungkah</ENAMEX>, known for its hot springs. They are believed to be both holy and highly therapeutic, and are channeled into a public pool¬†‚Äî¬†as hot as a steaming bath. You can also enjoy the thermal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX> at a new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">spa complex</ENAMEX> in the center of town. A scattering of homestays and rudimentary eating places has now been dwarfed by a big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX> resembling a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX>, with its own <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiberglass ‚Äúrock‚Äù</ENAMEX> pool fed by hot spring <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tirta</ENAMEX> makes a good base for the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two-hour</TIMEX> climb (longer in the heat of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX>) to the summit of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mount Batur</ENAMEX>. It‚Äôs best to start before dawn: Some of the guided <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> set out as early as <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3:30am</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guides</ENAMEX>, available locally or at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kintamani</ENAMEX>, can suggest various longer hikes.
Batur was rebuilt in its present position on the crater rim after a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1926</TIMEX> eruption buried the old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">site</ENAMEX> down below. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">One long</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> is lined with ugly concrete <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> and sheds, relieved by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pura Ulun Danu</ENAMEX>, the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> of black volcanic stone started in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1927</TIMEX> that is still being extended. Kintamani, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">adjoining</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Batur</ENAMEX>, is brightened up only by its market, on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">mornings</TIMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> follows on to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">north coast</ENAMEX>, passing close to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gunung Peninsulan</ENAMEX>, which is 1,745¬†m (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5,725¬†ft</NUMEX>) high. A flight of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">350¬†steps</ENAMEX> takes you to the summit, crowned by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bali‚</ENAMEX>Äôs tallest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pura Tegeh Koripan</ENAMEX>. Traces of stone structures date back to prehistoric times. At the very top, a plain walled <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enclosure</ENAMEX> holds a collection of beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stone statues</ENAMEX> and panels portraying gods and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rulers</ENAMEX>, some dating from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 10th and 11th centuries</TIMEX>. On a clear day, the views alone of the mountains and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">north</ENAMEX> coast make the rather strenuous climb well worth it.
Gunung Agung
Bali‚Äôs highest peak, at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3,142¬†m</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10,309¬†ft</NUMEX>), is also its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">holiest</TIMEX>. Still active <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, the volcano erupted in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1963</TIMEX> (see page¬<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">†23</NUMEX>) and poured red-hot lava down its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">slopes</ENAMEX>, setting <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">villages ablaze</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ash</ENAMEX> covered much of northern <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bali</ENAMEX>, ruining <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crops</ENAMEX>, blocking up the rivers, and causing mudslides that took many lives.
Besakih, known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Bali‚Äôs ‚</ENAMEX>Äúmother <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù</ENAMEX> stands high up on the southwestern <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">slopes</ENAMEX> of the mountain. From a distance you‚Äôll see a forest of black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">thatched</ENAMEX>, pagoda-like meru roofs rising in tiers above the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice terraces</ENAMEX>, with the volcano as a backdrop. This was probably even a holy place in the pre-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hindu</ENAMEX> era. During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than a thousand years</TIMEX> it has evolved into a complex of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly 200</NUMEX> temples and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrines</ENAMEX>. The most important <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> stands in the middle, representing the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> manifestations of God: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brahma</ENAMEX> (right, with great red banners), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shiva</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">center</ENAMEX>, with big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">white banners</ENAMEX>), and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vishnu</ENAMEX> (left, with large black banners). Most tour <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">buses</ENAMEX> arrive at mid-morning and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">mid-afternoon</TIMEX>, but no matter when you visit, you will be harassed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hawkers</ENAMEX>, goaded by guides, and ordered by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gatekeepers</ENAMEX> to make donations. Local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> don‚Äôt see this commercial activity as inappropriate; to them, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple isn‚</ENAMEX>Äôt a holy place until the gods are present, and that only happens during a religious ceremony.
There are also guides offering their services to those who want to climb <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gunung Agung</ENAMEX>; only the fit and well-prepared should attempt it, and only in the dry season. Even then, the expedition can take <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">as long as twelve hours</TIMEX> and involves a lot of slipping and sliding on stony <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">slopes</ENAMEX>.
Bedugul
The direct <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Denpasar</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Singaraja</ENAMEX> traverses some of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bali‚</ENAMEX>Äôs prettiest hill <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, with views of dormant volcanoes and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> crater lakes. At about 1,300¬†m (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4,300¬†ft</NUMEX>), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the spring</TIMEX>-like climate has made <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Bedugul¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> has lent its name to the whole <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">area¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†into something of a mountain retreat. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Botanic Gardens</ENAMEX> and orchid <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">nurseries</ENAMEX> are both at their best in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the rainy season</TIMEX> and make an agreeable place for a stroll or a picnic at any time. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bukit Mungsu</ENAMEX> market nearby is bright with <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> and superb <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX>, especially the local passion fruit. There are watersports <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lake Bratan</ENAMEX>, while the lake-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">side temple</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ulu Danu</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Candikuning</ENAMEX> ranks as one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bali‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most photogenic. (Its final <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX> is right out in the lake.) 
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pancasari</ENAMEX> has a variety of attractive cottage-style <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX>, and the views of the mountainside towering above <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lake Buyan</ENAMEX> in the distance, seen from the championship <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">golf course</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Bali Handara Kosaido Country Club</ENAMEX>, are superb. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> winds its way up to the old crater rim above the lake. You will find monkeys <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">congregating</ENAMEX> wherever you decide to stop and look at the view. Once you‚Äôve reached the top there‚Äôs a choice of routes to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">north</ENAMEX> coast. The main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> descends by way of bamboo forest and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">banana</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plantations</ENAMEX> direct to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Singaraja</ENAMEX>. Alternatively, you can take the little-used back road past <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">lakes Buyan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tamblingan</ENAMEX> and down through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Munduk</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Seririt</ENAMEX> (see page¬<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">†66</NUMEX>). The remote hillside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> specialize in growing cloves, and you will see (as well as smell) carpets of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">pink buds</ENAMEX> laid out by the roadside to dry. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Munduk</ENAMEX> is home to an excellent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">eco-resort</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Puri Lumbung</ENAMEX> (see page¬<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">†134</NUMEX>), and is an excellent base for exploring this beautiful region. It organizes many activities and coordinates inexpensive homestays with local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>. A new attraction in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Munduk</ENAMEX> is the so-called <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Pyramid Plastic</ENAMEX>, built from melted <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plastic waste</ENAMEX> as a reminder of the environmental damage that tourism and industry is causing in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bali</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Munduk</ENAMEX> waterfalls are spectacular, and accessible at the end of a manageable hike.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North Coast</ENAMEX>
Before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the days</TIMEX> of flying, most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bali</ENAMEX> arrived in the north. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> military expeditions disembarked near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Singaraja</ENAMEX>, which became the island‚Äôs administrative capital and the colony‚Äôs chief <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port</ENAMEX>. Now, almost everyone arrives and stays in southern <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bali</ENAMEX>, and only a fraction of them ever take a trip to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">north coast</ENAMEX>, although the journey takes <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">less than two hours</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>.
There is quite a contrast between the south and north. It is hotter and drier in the north and far less densely populated. The proportion of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslims</ENAMEX> is higher; some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are descended from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX> from other islands. There is only a narrow strip of flat land between the mountains and the sea, or in some places none at all. Cactus <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> are as common as palm <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> and the small area of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX> depends on irrigation. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> is also dotted with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bali‚</ENAMEX>Äôs local <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">vineyards</ENAMEX>.
Lacking an airport, losing the status of capital, and denied any substantial cash flow from tourism, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Singaraja</ENAMEX> hasn‚Äôt expanded as much as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Denpasar</ENAMEX>. As can be expected from the former capital, colonial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> predominate in the port <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">area</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bululeng</ENAMEX> (the original <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> that gave its name to the northern rajadom) and the old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>. But there‚Äôs little to detain a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitor</ENAMEX> and no attractive accommodations. For that, you have to travel a short distance out of¬†town.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lovina Beach</ENAMEX>
The beaches west of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Singaraja</ENAMEX> began to attract escapist <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">travelers</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1970s</TIMEX>, and simple and fairly inexpensive accommodations were built to house them. Slowly the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> grew and the small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homestays</ENAMEX> turned themselves into larger bungalow-type <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX>. Today, tour <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> come for short stays and, as everywhere in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bali</ENAMEX>, standards and prices are steadily going up. Actually, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lovina</ENAMEX> is not one village but a string of small ones, starting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6¬†km</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4¬†miles</NUMEX>) west of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Singaraja</ENAMEX> and continuing for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10¬†km</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">6¬†miles</NUMEX>) up the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">coast</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Shops</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, and moneychangers are scattered along the busy stretch.
The beach itself is shallow and gently shelving, making it an ideal place for small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>. There is calm <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> on the inside of the reef and good snorkeling over it. Lovina‚Äôs dark <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sand</ENAMEX> is less inviting than the white or golden variety at the southern <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX>, and gets too hot to walk on in bare feet in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the middle of the day</TIMEX>.
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Dawn and dusk</TIMEX> are the best times for the beach. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Dolphins frolic</ENAMEX> offshore almost every <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">morning¬†‚Äî¬†boats</ENAMEX> will take you out to see them up close. At sunset, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fishermen</ENAMEX> prepare for a night‚Äôs work aided by batteries of lights on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> to attract their catch, while local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX> herd their <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">goats</ENAMEX> or lead their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> buffaloes along the sand. If you‚Äôre lucky, you may be around to see the races between beautifully decorated pairs of water buffaloes pulling a sled around a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">track</ENAMEX> in the fields. Ask if any are scheduled: They follow the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Balinese</ENAMEX> calendar.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">East</ENAMEX> of Singaraja
Once clear of the outskirts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sangsit</ENAMEX>, look for a turn off the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> (there will be signs), heading towards the sea to the beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pura Beji</ENAMEX>. Dedicated to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">goddess</ENAMEX>, this is the most elaborate and ornate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> in the north. It‚Äôs decorated with intricate carvings of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, gods, and monsters.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> that leads inland for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5¬†km</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3¬†miles</NUMEX>) will take you to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jagaraga</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> fortified by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jelantik</ENAMEX> against the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colonialists</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1848 and 1849</TIMEX>. The small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> on the left-hand side just before you reach the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village center</ENAMEX> has some of the strangest carved stone decoration in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Bali¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†and some of the most secular, dating from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1930s</TIMEX>. In one <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>, an open-top car carries <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> being held up by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> with a gun, while others point up at some airplanes¬†‚Äî¬†one of them crashing into the sea. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jagaraga</ENAMEX> is also famous for its dance <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troupes</ENAMEX>, which can sometimes be seen in performance here.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">About 2¬†km</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">11‚ÅÑ2¬†miles</NUMEX>) to the south of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jagaraga, Sawan</ENAMEX> has a couple of gongmakers‚Äô workshops that supply gamelan <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">orchestras</ENAMEX>: The only other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> where the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">craft</ENAMEX> is practiced is in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tihingan</ENAMEX> situated near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Klungkung</ENAMEX> (see page¬<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">†51</NUMEX>). Methods are utterly traditional. Bronze is made by melting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">copper</ENAMEX> and tin together by heating them in an ancient pot over red-hot charcoal, or else old and broken instruments are recycled. The molten <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bronze</ENAMEX> is poured into <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stone molds</ENAMEX> to form rough discs, which are then hammered and heated and hammered again until they finally take the shape of gongs. It‚Äôs essential that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">craftsmen</ENAMEX> who make the gongs have a musical ear so that they are able to hear whether the sets of gongs are suitable for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>-tone Balinese scale. The correct note is ensured by adjusting the mass of metal and its distribution over the surface of the gong.
Back on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">coast</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kumbutambahan</ENAMEX>, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pura Maduwe Karang</ENAMEX>, you‚Äôll find a famous carving of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> on a bicycle, its wheels taking the form of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>. To the east, at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Sanih</ENAMEX> (or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeh Sanih</ENAMEX>), you can join local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> bathing in the pools fed by a natural <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">spring</TIMEX> and shaded by the palm <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>. A few simple tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bungalows</ENAMEX> have been built at the site.
The often empty coast road continues past <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tianyar</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tulamben</ENAMEX>, renowned for superb snorkeling and diving on the submerged wreck of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> cargo ship <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Liberty</ENAMEX>, which sank here during <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War</ENAMEX> II.
For information on the eastern tip of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bali</ENAMEX>, see page¬<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">†50</NUMEX>.
West of Singaraja
At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dencarik</ENAMEX>, to the west of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lovina</ENAMEX>, the road inland climbs a steep hill before reaching the orange-roofed building of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monastery</ENAMEX> known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brahma Vihara Arama</ENAMEX>. Nearby, at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Banjar Tega</ENAMEX>, the warm <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">springs</TIMEX> (signposted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Panas</ENAMEX>) have been piped into a public swimming pool, attractively shaded. There is a smaller and hotter pool, a natural shower, and reasonably clean changing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">market town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seririt</ENAMEX> is a busy junction with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> leading across the island to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tabenan</ENAMEX> and eventually to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Denpasar</ENAMEX> and the other following the coastal route westward. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Celukanbawang Bay</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12¬†km</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">7¬†miles</NUMEX>) from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Seririt</ENAMEX>, is likely to become an important <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port</ENAMEX> if development plans are realized. So far there‚Äôs a wharf, but rarely a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ship</ENAMEX> to be seen. After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about another 25¬†km</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">16¬†miles</NUMEX>) of sparsely settled shoreline, you‚Äôll come to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pura Pulaki</ENAMEX>, an important <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> recently rebuilt out of grim, black <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">volcanic stone</ENAMEX> and frequented by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkeys</ENAMEX>. Traces remain of older parts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> carved out of the cliff face, a natural aggregate of volcanic debris which quickly wears <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">away¬†‚Äî¬†the pebbly</ENAMEX> beach here is the result.
A large part of this end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> has been designated as the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Bali Barat National Park</ENAMEX>, and the road crosses a small section of it, an area covered with woodland and scrub, with plenty of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">grey monkeys</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> encompasses and protects 760¬†sq¬†km of true rainforests, mangrove swamps, and woodlands, and is home to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">over 100¬†species</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> (including the endangered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bali Starling</ENAMEX>), as well as many indigenous <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Visitors</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> must be accompanied by an official <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> guide, and must be issued a park permit. Both guides and permits can be arranged for by travel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>, or at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Park Headquarters</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3¬†km</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2¬†miles</NUMEX>) south of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gillimanuk</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Labuhan Lalang</ENAMEX>, on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Terima Bay</ENAMEX> at the western tip of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bali</ENAMEX>, is the base for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> which make the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">half-hour</TIMEX> trip to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pulau Menjangan</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Deer Island</ENAMEX>). Mainly scrub-covered and only 3¬†km (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2¬†miles</NUMEX>) long, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Labuhan Lalang‚</ENAMEX>Äôs coral reefs and clear <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> are highly rated among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCUBA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">divers</ENAMEX>.
Across the western tip of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bali</ENAMEX>, mangrove swamps surround <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gillimanuk</ENAMEX>, not much more than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> wide <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>, a few homestays, and the ferry terminal for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Java</ENAMEX>. The silhouette of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gunung Merapi</ENAMEX>, still an active volcano, is often visible in the mist across the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>.
West of Denpasar
Fertile land and high <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rainfall</ENAMEX> have brought prosperity to this part of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bali</ENAMEX>, without the debatable benefits of tourism. In the main <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX>, you‚Äôll find more computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">suppliers</ENAMEX> than souvenir <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>. There is very little in the way of accommodations and not much choice when it comes to eating, but the region is rewarding to explore.
Mengwi
Just to the northwest of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kapal</ENAMEX>, there‚Äôs a major <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> junction. The right fork goes north to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bedugul</ENAMEX> (see page¬<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">†61</NUMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Singaraja</ENAMEX>, but you only have to go 3¬†km (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2¬†miles</NUMEX>) to reach the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mengwi</ENAMEX>, where you‚Äôll find one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bali‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">temples</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pura Taman Ayun</ENAMEX>, near the center of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, was built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1634</TIMEX> and renovated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1937</TIMEX>. It‚Äôs notable for its double <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">moat</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Every morning</TIMEX> as well as <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">late in the afternoon</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> use the wide outer <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">moat</ENAMEX> for washing themselves and their clothes. You can circle the outside of the wall that surrounds the inner <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">compound</ENAMEX> and look in at the cluster of merus (pagoda-like, multi-roofed <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">towers</ENAMEX>). Meru <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">towers</ENAMEX> may only contain an odd number of roofs.
Once the daily influx of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> begins, about mid-morning, an outrigger <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat shuttles</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> across the outer <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">moat</ENAMEX> to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">craft</ENAMEX> display and shop.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North of Mengwi</ENAMEX> (signposted, as it is situated off the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>) is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sangeh Monkey Forest</ENAMEX>, a grove of tall <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">nutmeg trees</ENAMEX> protected for their religious significance and also as a nature preserve. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> engage in their business, swinging from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> to branch, and they flock to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bukit Sari</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX>, while <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hawkers</ENAMEX> swarm around the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>. Remember to hide all portable possessions from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkeys</ENAMEX>.
Those in the mood to explore should head north from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sangeh</ENAMEX>, where the road climbs into lovely countryside and rarely visited <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX>. Eventually it peters out on the slopes of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mount Catur</ENAMEX>.
Marga
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November 1946</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ngurah Rai</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> were trapped by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> close to this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12¬†km</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">7¬†miles</NUMEX>) northwest of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mengwi</ENAMEX>. In an heroic but hopeless last stand, they were all killed (see page¬<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">†21</NUMEX>). The battlefield just north of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> is now marked by several memorials. A statue depicts a¬†group of defiant freedom <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fighters</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Margarana</ENAMEX> monument is a tall candi (or <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrine</ENAMEX>) whose columns carry the symbols of pancasila, the¬†five principles of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indonesian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> (see page¬<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">†37</NUMEX>). Carved panels record <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ngurah Rai‚</ENAMEX>Äôs message to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX>, demanding their withdrawal and ending with the words ‚ÄúSekali <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merdeka, Tetap</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Merdeka‚Äù (‚ÄúFreedom</ENAMEX> now, freedom forever‚Äù). Beyond the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrine</ENAMEX> is a field of memorials to all those who died for the cause of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bali‚</ENAMEX>Äôs independence¬†‚Äî¬<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">†1,372¬†men</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> in total. It looks like a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cemetery</ENAMEX>, but these are not actual graves. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> at the site is worth a visit for the photographs and other relics of the campaign.
If you have reliable transport and a good road map, head farther north into the hills for <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">16 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 miles</NUMEX>) along little-used <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pura Luhur</ENAMEX>, the chief <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> of the rajadom of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tabenan</ENAMEX>, beautifully set amid lush forest. Despite its ancient appearance, this is a modern reconstruction¬<ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">†‚Äî¬†lichens</ENAMEX> grow quickly in the high humidity.
Tanah Lot
Practically every brochure for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bali</ENAMEX> shows this exotic sea <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> on its rocky islet, often silhouetted against the setting sun. Inevitably, tour <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">buses</ENAMEX> converge here in late afternoon so everyone can take that same picture. It is 10¬†km (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">6¬†miles</NUMEX>) down a narrow side <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kediri</ENAMEX> to the coast, and there can be a long procession of traffic. You might like to plan a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">dawn</TIMEX> visit instead, avoiding at least some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hawkers</ENAMEX> who congregate later in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tanah Lot</ENAMEX> is believed to have been founded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16th century</TIMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Javanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priest</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nirarta</ENAMEX>, who dedicated it to the sea god. Now the sea threatens to undermine the rock on which it stands, and concrete breakwaters have been positioned to hold back the waves. Nothing, however, is done to hold back the commercial tide. Ever more souvenir stands and food stalls cluster as near as they can get, and the nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">coast</ENAMEX> is being developed as a huge, and controversial, resort <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>.
But the former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">raja‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tabanan</ENAMEX> goes about its business with few concessions to tourism. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> burned the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> here in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1906</TIMEX>, so the heart of the old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> is gone, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tabanan</ENAMEX> remains a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> for music and dance. Kerambitan, just off the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> to the southwest, is a pretty <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palaces</ENAMEX>, still the property of a princely <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>. Today, one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palaces</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Puri Anyar</ENAMEX>, acts as an aristocratic type of homestay, where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guests</ENAMEX> can experience the traditional hospitality that might have been extended to honored <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> in the past.
The main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> reaches the coast at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Soka</ENAMEX>, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> small beaches and occasional good surfing waves. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Balian Beach</ENAMEX> is similar, with informal bungalow accommodations. Experienced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">surfers head</ENAMEX> west to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Medewi</ENAMEX>, where simple but pleasant new cottage-style <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> face a mostly rocky shore with a small beach.
The sea temple at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rambut Siwi</ENAMEX>, off the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>, stands on a black rock overlooking the sandy shore. Some attractive <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> and a profusion of flowering <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> crown the cliff top.
Negara, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23¬†km</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">14¬†miles</NUMEX>) farther west, is known for its water-<ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">buffalo racing</ENAMEX>. The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX> traditionally ran in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX>, and the championships still take place then, but races for the benefit of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> are now staged <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year-round</TIMEX> on a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">track</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Perencak</ENAMEX>, outside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Negara</ENAMEX>. Tour <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> offer excursions from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kuta, Sanur</ENAMEX>, and the other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX>.
Lombok
Bali‚Äôs smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX> to the east, easily visible on a clear day, is at times billed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hopeful promoters</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">developers</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚Äúthe</ENAMEX> next <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bali</ENAMEX>.‚Äù That, however, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">paints</ENAMEX> a misleading picture; the scenery, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, their culture, and religion are all too different. There is less <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rainfall</ENAMEX> and the rainy season is prone to fail, leaving most of the island parched and dusty. It may be <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">only a 20-minute</TIMEX> flight away, or <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a few hours</TIMEX> by ferry, but it‚Äôs another world. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lombok</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">roughly 70¬†km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">43¬†miles</NUMEX>) from north to south and the same distance across. Its one great mountain, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gunung Rinjani</ENAMEX>, is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> highest in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indonesia</ENAMEX> and dominates the northern <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of the island. Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> live on the east-west plain across the middle, fertile after rain and sun-scorched by the dry season. The far south is arid, with low, scrub-covered hills and eroded valleys, rather like some parts of northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australia</ENAMEX>.
From a study of their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">naturalist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alfred Wallace</ENAMEX> divided the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indonesian</ENAMEX> islands into a western <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, regarded as part of southeast <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX>, and an eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, which belonged geographically to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Australia/Oceania</ENAMEX>. He then drew the line between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> through the deep <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lombok Strait</ENAMEX> separating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bali</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lombok</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX> is not quite so clear-cut now, but the basic principle of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚ÄúWallace Line‚</ENAMEX>Äù is still accepted.
For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many years</TIMEX>, the island of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lombok</ENAMEX> was the domain of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sasaks</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who had come from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asian</ENAMEX> mainland by way of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Java</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bali</ENAMEX>. They were animists who revered the spirits they believed to be in the living things and inanimate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX> around them. As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Islam</ENAMEX> spread through the islands (apart from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bali</ENAMEX>) some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lombok</ENAMEX> adopted it in a version of their own, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wektu Telu</ENAMEX>, which retained many influences of animism. Today, a majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are more or less orthodox <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslims</ENAMEX>: As you travel about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lombok</ENAMEX>, you will notice many exotic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> mosques with their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">domes</ENAMEX> and arabesque <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arcades</ENAMEX>, as well as the growing numbers of young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> who wear robes and headscarves.
The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> succession of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Balinese</ENAMEX> invasions started in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16th century</TIMEX>. For a while, most of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lombok</ENAMEX> was governed from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Karangasem</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bali</ENAMEX>. Later, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Balinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lombok</ENAMEX> became independent, and even attempted to capture Karangasem! The beliefs of the animist-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hindu Balinese</ENAMEX> and the animist-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim Sasaks</ENAMEX>, however, were not always in conflict; there was a lot of intermarriage. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Balinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minority</ENAMEX> mainly lives in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">west Lombok</ENAMEX> and is influential in commerce and tourism.
At <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the 19th century</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> took advantage of the conflict raging between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sasaks</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Balinese</ENAMEX>, joining in on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sasak</ENAMEX> side and then taking complete control. After the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> occupied <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lombok</ENAMEX> during <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> briefly returned, only to depart again when <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indonesia</ENAMEX> gained independence.
Where to Go in Lombok
You won‚Äôt find many notable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">temples</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palaces</ENAMEX>, or other historic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX>, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lombok</ENAMEX> are rewarded with the pleasures of the island‚Äôs relaxed, rustic ways: the sight of water buffaloes and their <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">calves</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">hens</ENAMEX>, and chicks dashing across your <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">path</ENAMEX>; sudden views of blue sea dotted with sails. Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> stay in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hotels</ENAMEX> alongside <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Senggigi</ENAMEX> beach, but the far south and the offshore <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gilis</ENAMEX> also have good beaches and snorkeling.
Some <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> are renowned for their traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">crafts¬†‚Äî¬†intricate basketry</ENAMEX>, weaving, pottery, or carving. A few of them have realized the chances of increasing the flow of tourist traffic, setting up <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stalls</ENAMEX> by the roadside or getting younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> to bring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> to have a look at the work going on. For an insight into village life, it‚Äôs worth inquiring about the timing of local market <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>, held in the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">mornings</TIMEX> once or twice a week in many <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Roads</ENAMEX> are refreshingly free of traffic; a prime source of motive power is still the tiny ponies pulling unlikely loads in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-wheeled traps.
Ampenan, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mataram</ENAMEX>, and Cakranegara
Flights land at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Selaparang Airport</ENAMEX>, on the northern outskirts of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lombok‚Äôs</ENAMEX> provincial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mataram</ENAMEX>. The ferries from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bali</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dock</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lembar</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6 miles</NUMEX>) to the south. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the most pleasant, exotic ways to arrive in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lombok</ENAMEX> is on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bounty</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mabua Express</ENAMEX> ferries. Faster and more comfortable (and more expensive) than the older ferries from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Padangbai</ENAMEX>, these leave <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bali</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Benoa Harbor</ENAMEX> and arrive at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bangsal</ENAMEX>, close to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gilli Islands</ENAMEX>. Small craft take you from the ferries to the beach at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bangsal</ENAMEX> or to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gilli Islands</ENAMEX>, avoiding the grungy <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lembar</ENAMEX>, and introducing you immediately to the more idyllic parts of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lombok</ENAMEX>.
Not so long ago, the old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ampenan</ENAMEX>, the administrative center of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mataram</ENAMEX>, and the commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">district</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cakranegara</ENAMEX> were completely separate. Now they have joined up in an urban sprawl, home to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a quarter of a million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. A long, broad avenue lined by an improbable number of government <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> links them all and then continues to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sweta</ENAMEX>, the island‚Äôs transport <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hub</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port</ENAMEX> area of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ampenan</ENAMEX> is crumbling and mostly disused, but the narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> of the old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> are livelier. Many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> here are descended from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">traders¬†‚Äî¬†noticeable</ENAMEX> in the well-attended mosques and the cries of the muezzins in their minarets calling the faithful to prayer. A¬†variety of so-called <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">‚Äúantique‚</ENAMEX>Äù <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> sell the odd interesting relic amid piles of dusty junk. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>, which is south of the center on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jalan Banjar Tilar Negara</ENAMEX>, gives an overview of the island‚Äôs culture, as well as its unique and volatile ecology.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mataram</ENAMEX> has the array of government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX> found in every <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indonesian</ENAMEX> provincial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX>, as well as tree-lined residential <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> with many opulent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cakranegara</ENAMEX> (or just <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Cakra¬†‚Äî¬†remember</ENAMEX> that it is pronounced <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚ÄúChakra‚Äù</ENAMEX>) grew up around the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Balinese</ENAMEX> rajas. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> it is the commercial center of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lombok</ENAMEX>. All that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">remains</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> of the royal compound is the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1744</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mayura Water Palace</ENAMEX>, the former meeting <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> of justice standing in the middle of a lake and reached by a causeway guarded by old cannons. This was the scene of a short-lived <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Balinese</ENAMEX> victory over <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1894</TIMEX>. The result was reversed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">only weeks later</TIMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> went on to take over the whole island.
Across the way, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pura Meru</ENAMEX>, the biggest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lombok</ENAMEX>, was built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1720</TIMEX>. It has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three meru</NUMEX>-topped <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrines</ENAMEX> dedicated to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brahma, Shiva</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vishnu</ENAMEX>. The huge wooden drums in the outer <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX> are sounded, calling the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hindu</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> to festivals and ceremonies. Just to the east, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sweta</ENAMEX> buzzes with bemos, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">buses</ENAMEX>, and pony-powered cidomos.
Near the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Capital</ENAMEX>
The hillside gardens and lake at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Narmada</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10¬†km</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">6¬†miles</NUMEX>) east of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cakranegara</ENAMEX>, were laid out for a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">raja</ENAMEX> to remind him of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gunung Rinjani</ENAMEX> and its crater lake when he became too infirm to make the journey to the real mountain. The resemblance is harder to see now that an extra pool and a rectangular swimming pool have been added.
To the north of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Narmada</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lingsar</ENAMEX>, a new <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">spring</TIMEX> is said to have burst into life to greet the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Balinese</ENAMEX> when they came to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lombok</ENAMEX>, and they chose the site for an ecumenical temple intended to bring together <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of different religions. The upper compound is reserved for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hindus</ENAMEX>. The pool in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Wektu</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Telu</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">home</ENAMEX> of big plump eels, overfed on offerings of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">boiled eggs</ENAMEX> which are conveniently sold by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendors</ENAMEX> at the gate. In another enclosure, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stones</ENAMEX> wound in white cloth with a yellow sash come from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gunung Rinjani</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Taoists</ENAMEX> have put mirrors there to repel the malevolent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spirits</ENAMEX>.
At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Suranadi</ENAMEX>, in the gardens just east of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lingsar</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX> are on the menu again, for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> of a pond in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX> of the Holy Eels. You can swim, too, in a separate <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">spring</TIMEX>-fed pool or at the old <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX>-built <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX>. You can also play <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">golf</ENAMEX> at the nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">country club</ENAMEX>.
Monkeys wait by the roadside for handouts as you approach <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gunung Pensong</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> located on top of a rocky outcrop <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6¬†km</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4¬†miles</NUMEX>) south of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital city</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mataram</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Senggigi Beach</ENAMEX> and the Gilis
Heading north along the coast from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ampenan</ENAMEX>, look for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pura Segara</ENAMEX>, a sea <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> on the shore near a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cemetery</ENAMEX>. Close by, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">villagers</ENAMEX> gather to haul the fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> up the beach and help sort the catch.
Batubolong temple <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stands</ENAMEX> perched on a rock¬†‚Äî¬†a good lookout point to watch the sunset over the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lombok Strait</ENAMEX>.
The prime place to stay is around <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Senggigi Beach</ENAMEX>, just north of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Batubolong</ENAMEX>. There are accommodations in all sizes strung out along a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10-km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6-mile</NUMEX>) strip of coast starting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about 8¬†km</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5¬†miles</NUMEX>) north of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ampenan</ENAMEX>. The beach shelves steeply in places and the coral reef or rocks can be just below the surface, so it‚Äôs advisable to wear rubber shoes.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North of Senggigi</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> is like <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> big giddy roller-coaster that passes some of the lovliest coastline in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indonesian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">archipelago</ENAMEX>. At times it climbs to the cliff tops, and then swoops down into bays. Tiny fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> hide among the palm <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> and the sea is flecked with bright lateen sails of prahus out after tuna and snapper.
Instead of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">coast</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>, tours from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senggigi</ENAMEX> and traffic from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mataram</ENAMEX> sometimes take the inland route via the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Pasuk Pass</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> ways meet at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pemenang</ENAMEX>, where a side <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> leads to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">harbor</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bangsal</ENAMEX>, the starting point for trips to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gilis</ENAMEX>. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Visitors</ENAMEX> often call them the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gili Islands</ENAMEX>, but gili means ‚Äúisland.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äù</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gili Air</ENAMEX> is nearest, about 3¬†km (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2¬†miles</NUMEX>) away. Next comes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gili Meno and then Gili Trawangan</ENAMEX>, the farthest out at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8¬†km</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5¬†miles</NUMEX>), and the biggest, although it‚Äôs only 21‚ÅÑ2¬†km (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">11‚ÅÑ2¬†miles</NUMEX>) long.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gilis</ENAMEX> are known for their tranquility, surrounded by sparkling waters. Snorkeling, diving, and sunning are the islands‚Äô chief activities. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> that ply the route from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bangsal</ENAMEX> to the islands wait for a full load of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15 to 20¬†people</TIMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August</TIMEX> that won‚Äôt take long, but out of season you can face a delay unless you pay for the empty <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">places</ENAMEX> or charter a whole <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> (fares are low and fixed).
There‚Äôs losmen or bungalow accommodations and a growing number of new, very comfortable small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> islands, as well as small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> where you can buy basic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX>, bottled <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, and cold <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drinks</ENAMEX>. Warungs serve simple <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meals</ENAMEX>, mostly the standard <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indonesian</ENAMEX>-style dishes and whatever fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> has come in.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mountain Treks</ENAMEX>
The silhouette of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gunung Rinjani</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3,726¬†m</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">12,200¬†ft</NUMEX>) tall, can be seen from every part of the island, sometimes as a single peak, other times like a line of broken teeth. An active volcano (although there has been no major eruption for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a century</TIMEX>), the mountain is sacred to both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sasaks</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Balinese</ENAMEX>, who make pilgrimages to its crater lake and hot springs. Recently it has begun to attract <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreigners</ENAMEX>, too, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> in the foothills to the south of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bayan</ENAMEX> are the most popular starting points. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trekking</ENAMEX> is only safe in the dry <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between June and September</TIMEX>.
A rough and narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> from the middle of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bayan</ENAMEX> ascends rapidly to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Batu Koq</ENAMEX>, and then continues to nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Senaru</ENAMEX>, where it ends. Those wanting to go farther have to walk. The original tiny <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> has traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Sasak</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> on stilts, surrounded by a wooden fence. Some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locals</ENAMEX> have opened homestays along the road, a few with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">warung</ENAMEX> attached. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guides</ENAMEX> and porters can be hired by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX>, and you can buy basic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> and rent camping gear, including <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tents</ENAMEX>. Take water-purifying <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tablets</ENAMEX>, warm clothes, and arrange for a small camping stove.
The main objective of most trekkers is the awesome crater with its big <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">C-shaped</ENAMEX> lake. It‚Äôs a hard day‚Äôs walk from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senaru</ENAMEX> before you reach the rim. The crater itself is 600¬†m (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2,000¬†ft</NUMEX>) deep, and the steep, quite slippery scramble down to the lake takes <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">several hours</TIMEX> more. Plan <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least a three-day</TIMEX> expedition (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> if you also want to climb to the top of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rinjani</ENAMEX>). Those with a lot less time and energy could take a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">half-hour</TIMEX> walk to a beautiful waterfall and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pools</ENAMEX> in the valley below <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senaru</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East</ENAMEX> Lombok
As in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bali</ENAMEX>, different areas specialize in particular crafts, but until recently it all happened behind closed doors. Now the increased tourist traffic has encouraged local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to set up <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stalls</ENAMEX> by the roadside, and some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> have become quite accustomed to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>.
At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sukarara</ENAMEX>, to the south of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mataram</ENAMEX>, you will find almost every <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> has an old-fashioned loom for weaving the gorgeous songket <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fabric</ENAMEX>, which mingles <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX> and silver threads with <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">cotton</ENAMEX>. Penujak, a little farther south, produces pottery, including some trick water pots which can be tipped upside down without spilling the contents. Invert them again and you can pour as normal. The secret of this maneuver is a clever <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">interior partition</ENAMEX>.
Beleke, east of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">market town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Praya</ENAMEX>, specializes in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">craft</ENAMEX> of intricate basketry. They say that it takes them a week to make a large tablemat. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rambitan</ENAMEX> is a traditional type of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sasak</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> with thatch-and-bamboo <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> and tall <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">barns</ENAMEX>, but it sees a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>, and you may well be besieged by souvenir <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sellers</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sade</ENAMEX> is similar but smaller. Look for the simple thatch-roofed mosques in both <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX>. 
Farther south, the dry scrub-covered hills slowly give way to semi-desert, with an occasional grove of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">coconut palms</ENAMEX> playing the role of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">oasis</ENAMEX>. Energetic resurfacing and new construction has transformed the road, but <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuta Beach</ENAMEX> is still far from resembling its namesake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bali</ENAMEX>. Most of the time, its white <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coral sands</ENAMEX> are largely deserted. Most accommodations are still in simple <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cottages</ENAMEX>, some with a modest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX> as well. Otherwise you can find a cheap warung. <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Novotel‚Äôs Mandalika Resort</ENAMEX>, designed to resemble a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sasak Village</ENAMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sands</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuta Beach</ENAMEX>, is the one upscale vacation <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> in the area. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hotels</ENAMEX> in the area can arrange transportation to some of the beautiful, isolated beaches nearby. The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> market at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">hamlet</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kuta</ENAMEX> is lively and interesting. Once a year in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few days</TIMEX> after the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> full moon of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX>, crowds gather on the beach for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bau Nyale</ENAMEX>. The all-night festival is timed to coincide with the hatching of strange <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worms</ENAMEX> from the sea¬†bed.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East of Narmada</ENAMEX>, near the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> that runs through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lombok</ENAMEX>, there is a cluster of craft <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX>. The baskets and tablemats from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Loyok</ENAMEX> are famous throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indonesia</ENAMEX>. In neighboring <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rungkang</ENAMEX>, they make smooth <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">jet</ENAMEX>-black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pots</ENAMEX> of all sizes and then weave a fine basket to fit tightly around them, using supple lengths of ultra-thin rattan.
On the southern <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">slopes</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gunung Rinjani, Tete Batu</ENAMEX> is a favorite local retreat, with an old hotel and a couple of homestays. Here you can walk to forest waterfalls, while the black <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkeys chatter</ENAMEX>, squeal, and swing in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Labuhan Lombok</ENAMEX> is a hot, windswept, dusty, end-of-the-world sort of spot, in spite of its picturesque stilt <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>. From here, ferries laden with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX>, motorbikes, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> sail several times a day eastward to the island of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sumbawa</ENAMEX> from a terminal 3¬†km (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2¬†miles</NUMEX>) from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX>.
