WHERE TO GO
A lthough a small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX> is blessed with incredible geographical diversity. Carved out of the western <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">sixth</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iberian</ENAMEX> peninsula, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> is quite easy to get around. Even a relatively short amount of time and distance covered allows <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> to sample varied regions and attractions, including famed beaches, rugged mountains, splendid <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">castles</ENAMEX>, traditional rural <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX>, and gorgeous medieval <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>. Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> still focus on the charming capital, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lisbon</ENAMEX>, and the alluring sunny beaches of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve</ENAMEX>, but there‚Äôs much more to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Lisbon</ENAMEX>
For years <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lisbon</ENAMEX> has enjoyed a reputation as a relatively quiet <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, without the hustle, bustle, and general hassle of other major <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>. While there are still ample remnants of that easy-going charm, the gap is quickly closing; the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> now hardly lacks for traffic and noise.
Portugal‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital city</ENAMEX> is the country‚Äôs largest, with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than 2 million</NUMEX>. Due to a massive earthquake that obliterated much of the ancient city, most of the architecture that remains is from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 18th century</TIMEX>. However, old sections of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> survive in the winding <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">alleys</ENAMEX> of the medieval and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moorish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">district</ENAMEX>, known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alfama</ENAMEX>. (The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> is covered in greater detail in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Berlitz Pocket Guide</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lisbon</ENAMEX>).
The center of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lisbon</ENAMEX> is small, compact, and easy to get around in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">just a few days</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> is built on <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">hills¬†‚Äî¬†by</ENAMEX> legend <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX>, but in fact many more¬†‚Äî¬†providing several splendid vantage points. Perhaps the best place to start your tour of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lisbon</ENAMEX> is from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moors‚</ENAMEX>Äô old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Castelo de S√</ENAMEX>£o <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jorge</ENAMEX>. The fall of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> to crusaders in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1147</TIMEX> proved crucial in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reconquest</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moors</ENAMEX>. From its ramparts you can take in the whole of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> and the broad <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rio Tejo</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">River Tagus</ENAMEX>), spanned by the longest suspension <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alfama & Baixa</ENAMEX> districts
Nearby, the atmospheric medieval <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alfama</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">district</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lisbon‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most picturesque and fascinating area. It spills down the side of a hill between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Castelo de S√</ENAMEX>£o <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jorge</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tagus</ENAMEX> with all the color and bustle of an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> bazaar. The bairro (district), in fact a legacy of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moors</ENAMEX>, is a charming labyrinth of crooked <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>, cobbled alleyways, decaying old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palaces</ENAMEX>, fish <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stalls</ENAMEX>, and fado music <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clubs</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alfama</ENAMEX> was one of the few areas to survive the earthquake. 
Another majestic view of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> is from a charming <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Miradouro de Santa Luzia</ENAMEX>, just down the hill from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lisbon‚Äôs S√© Patriarcal</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cathedral</ENAMEX>) appears out of nowhere at a bend in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> (most easily reached from the center by continuing east on the extension of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rua da Concei√ß√£o</ENAMEX>). Begun as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">fortress-church</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 12th century</TIMEX>, its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">towers</ENAMEX> and walls suggest a beleaguered citadel. Adjacent to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">cathedral</ENAMEX> is the lovely <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Igreja de Santo Ant√≥nio da S√©</ENAMEX>, named for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lisbon‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patron saint</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Anthony of Padua</ENAMEX>.
Just beyond the dense <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">quarters</TIMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alfama</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S√£o Vicente de Fora</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Vincent Beyond the Walls</ENAMEX>), an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italianate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> and monastic cloister. The latter is the true highlight: Its courtyards are lined with blue-and-white azulejos and the views from the roof are among the best in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>.
Down toward the river is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museu Nacional</ENAMEX> do <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Azulejo</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Azulejo Museum</ENAMEX>), devoted entirely to the art of painted and glazed ceramic tiles, a national art form. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">About 12,000</NUMEX> are on display here, from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15th-century</TIMEX> polychrome designs to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20th-century</TIMEX> art deco styles. A prized possession is the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lisbon Panorama</ENAMEX>, a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">36 m-</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">118 ft-</ENAMEX>) long tile composition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lisbon‚Äôs</ENAMEX> riverside as it looked before the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">1755 earthquake</ENAMEX>. Part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>, which occupies a former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">convent</ENAMEX>, is the fabulous interior of the small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Igreja da Madre de Deus</ENAMEX>, a heady mix of gilt <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rococo</ENAMEX> and gorgeous azulejos. 
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">district</ENAMEX> known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baixa</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lower City)¬†‚Äî¬†the low-lying area</ENAMEX> between hills on either <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">side¬†‚Äî¬†was</ENAMEX> devastated by the great earthquake of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1755</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marqu√™s de Pombal</ENAMEX> supervised the city‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reconstruction</ENAMEX>, redesigning it according to a geometric grid of broad <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">avenues</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baixa</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lisbon‚</ENAMEX>Äôs principal business district. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pra√ßa do Com√©rcio</ENAMEX>, a grand <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> with a vast triumphal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arch</ENAMEX>, is lined on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sides</ENAMEX> by gracious arcaded <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> (also called by its former name <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Terreiro do Pa√ßo</ENAMEX>), wholly wiped out by the great earthquake of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1755</TIMEX>, has seen its share of watershed political events: <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carlos</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> were felled by an assassin‚Äôs bullets there in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1908</TIMEX>, and it was the site of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> uprisings of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Carnation Revolution of 1974</ENAMEX>.
Ferries ply across the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tagus</ENAMEX> from a point near the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>, and from another to the west near the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cais do Sodr√</ENAMEX>© <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">railway station</ENAMEX>, where trains depart for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Estoril</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cascais</ENAMEX>. 
A wide pedestrian shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rua Augusta</ENAMEX>, leads from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pra√</ENAMEX>ßa do <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Com√</ENAMEX>©rcio through a stately arch to the central <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lisbon</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pra√ßa Dom Pedro IV</ENAMEX>, better known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rossio</ENAMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Common</ENAMEX>). Once the scene of bullfights, it now hosts a funfair and is a popular meeting point, ringed by caf√©s. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Theater</ENAMEX> is located here, and across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Esta√ß√£o do Rossio</ENAMEX> (with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trains</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sintra</ENAMEX> and other places), which looks something like a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moorish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> with horseshoe arches, just west of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">blocks</ENAMEX> north is another lively <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pra√</ENAMEX>ßa dos <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Restauradores</ENAMEX>, with its historic obelisk commemorating the overthrow of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish Hapsburg</ENAMEX> rule in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1640</TIMEX>. The main tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> is located here at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pal√°cio Foz</ENAMEX>, on the west side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>.
The broad and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">leafy Avenida da Liberdade</ENAMEX> runs for <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.6 mile</NUMEX>) north, flanked by gardens, ponds, and fountains, as far as the circular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Pra√ßa Marqu√™s de Pombal</ENAMEX> (also known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rotunda</ENAMEX>), where a statue of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dictator</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pombal</ENAMEX> gazes over the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North of Parque</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Eduardo VII</ENAMEX>, off <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Avenida Ant√≥nio Augusto Auiar</ENAMEX>, is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lisbon‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most remarkable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museu Gulbenkian</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the finest private collections in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> (since bequeathed to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX>), it was created as an exhibiton space for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of works of art acquired by the renowned <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Armenian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">billionaire</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Calouste Gulbenkian</ENAMEX>. A little further north you‚Äôll find the impressive <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Aguas Livres Aqueduct</ENAMEX>, which still carries <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> along its <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">18-km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">11-mile</NUMEX>) length to a point near the modern <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Amoreiras Shopping Center</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bairro Alto & Bel√</ENAMEX>©m
Back toward the river, and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">just</NUMEX> west of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pra√</ENAMEX>ßa do <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Com√</ENAMEX>©rcio is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lapa</ENAMEX>, an elegant residential neighborhood. Its standout attraction is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museu Nacional de Arte Antiga</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Museum of Ancient Art</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Portugal‚</ENAMEX>Äôs largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>. Among its masterpieces of international renown are The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adoration</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">St.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vincent</ENAMEX>, a multi-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> work attributed to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 15th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">master</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nuno Gon√ßalves</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Temptation of St. Anthony</ENAMEX>, a fantastic hallucination by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hieronymus Bosch</ENAMEX>, tempered with humor and executed with mad <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genius</ENAMEX>. 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bairro Alto</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Upper City</ENAMEX>) is a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">hilly</NUMEX> area full of evocative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> decorated with wrought-iron <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">balconies</ENAMEX> usually occupied by birdcages and flowerpots. At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">district</ENAMEX> is loaded with atmosphere: <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patrons</ENAMEX> tumble from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">theaters</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX>, and fado <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clubs</ENAMEX>. It‚Äôs a relatively harmless place by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX>, but you should exercise some care after dark. 
Perched on the edge of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bairro Alto</ENAMEX> is one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lisbon‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most evocative sights, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">shell</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 14th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Igreja do Carmo</ENAMEX>, which was packed with worshippers on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">All Saints‚Äô Day, 1755</TIMEX>, when the terrible earthquake brought the roof down. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> remains deliberately preserved as an atmospheric ruin. Nearby, the sumptuous <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Igreja de S√£o Roque</ENAMEX> features a lavish baroque <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">chapel of S√£o Jo√£o Baptista</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. John the Baptist</ENAMEX>) and a small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> of sacred art.
You can easily walk to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bairro Alto</ENAMEX> from the central squares in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baixa</ENAMEX>, but it‚Äôs also fun to go by tram or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> the landmark <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">30-m</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">98</NUMEX>-ft) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Elevador de Santa Justa</ENAMEX>, which you‚Äôll find just off Rossio <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>. The stately elevator, a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1902</TIMEX> Victorian marvel of iron and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glass</ENAMEX>, was built by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Raul Mesnier</ENAMEX> (not <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Gustave Eiffel</ENAMEX>, as many continue to believe). The longer, slower route back downhill meanders through the elegant shopping area of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chiado</ENAMEX>, now totally rebuilt after a drastic <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX> fire that swept through the district. 
Some <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4 miles</NUMEX>) west of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pra√</ENAMEX>ßa do <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Com√</ENAMEX>©rcio along the river lies the riverside <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">district of Bel√©m</ENAMEX>. Many of the great voyages of discovery set out from here in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 15th and 16th centuries</TIMEX>. The new sea routes produced a golden age of commerce, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Manuel</ENAMEX> built <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> magnificent monuments to commemorate the country‚Äôs achievements.
One is the small but exquisite <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Torre de Bel√©m</ENAMEX>, a romantic medieval fortress (particularly when floodlit by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>) erected in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1515</TIMEX> to defend the entry to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lisbon</ENAMEX> and one of the finest examples of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Manueline</ENAMEX> architecture (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>). 
By contrast, the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">majestic Mosteiro</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dos</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jer√≥nimos</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lisbon‚</ENAMEX>Äôs largest religious monument and a truly formidable example of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Manueline</ENAMEX> architecture. The imposing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> and its double-decker <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cloister miraculously</ENAMEX> survived the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">1755 earthquake</ENAMEX>. In addition to royal tombs, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monastery</ENAMEX> holds the relics of national <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heroes</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vasco da Gama</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Luis de Cam√µes</ENAMEX>. It also houses an archaeology <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>, and next door is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Museu da Marinha</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Naval Museum</ENAMEX>). 
Back down the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> toward <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lisbon</ENAMEX> is the highly popular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museu Nacional</ENAMEX> dos <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Coches</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Coach Museum</ENAMEX>), located in the former riding school of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bel√©m Royal Palace</ENAMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bel√</ENAMEX>©m‚Äôs best-known symbols is the modern <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Padr√</ENAMEX>£o dos <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Descobrimentos</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Monument to the Discoveries</ENAMEX>). The huge waterfront sculpture depicts <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prince</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry the Navigator</ENAMEX> at the prow of a stylized caravel jutting into the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tagus River</ENAMEX>. The figures just behind <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prince</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry</ENAMEX> represent noted explorers, map-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">makers</ENAMEX>, and astronomers whom he mobilized in order to launch <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX> into the history books.
Other attractions in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bel√</ENAMEX>©m include the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gulbenkian Institute‚Äôs Planetarium</ENAMEX> and the huge <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Centro Cultural de Bel√©m</ENAMEX>, home to concerts and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">art</ENAMEX> exhibits.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eastern Lisbon</ENAMEX>
At the extreme opposite of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lisbon‚</ENAMEX>Äôs newest attraction is the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> designed for the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World Expo ‚</ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Äô98</NUMEX>, which did much to reinvigorate the faltering industrial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">section</ENAMEX> in the eastern part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. Continuing to draw <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> to the riverfront <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parque das Na√ß√µes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nations Park</ENAMEX>) is its world-class <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">aquarium</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ocean√°rio de Lisboa</ENAMEX>, perhaps the world‚Äôs top <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">aquarium</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> is out of the way, but easily accessible by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metro</ENAMEX> (subway).
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LISBON ENVIRONS</ENAMEX>
Queluz
Just <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">14 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">8 miles</NUMEX>) west of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lisbon</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palacio Nacional de Queluz</ENAMEX>, home to the pretty pink palace commissioned by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pedro III</ENAMEX>. The sumptuous summer <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> was built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the second half of the 18th century</TIMEX> as an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> working <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX> for the royal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palace Gardens</ENAMEX> are the pride of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Queluz</ENAMEX>, with clipped <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">hedges</ENAMEX> in perfect geometric array, imaginative fountains, and armies of statues. 
Sintra
Though <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sintra</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">30 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">18 miles</NUMEX>) to the northwest of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lisbon</ENAMEX>, suffers the effects of its enduring popularity, it is one of the finest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX> to visit. Nestled into the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Serra de Sintra</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">25 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">16 miles</NUMEX>) northwest of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lisbon</ENAMEX>, it was once a coveted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> retreat for royals and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> is a romantic getaway for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> from all over the world. Clustered throughout the forested hillsides are old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palaces</ENAMEX> and estates with spectacular vistas. 
Located right in the center of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> is the spectacular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pal√°cio Nacional de Sintra</ENAMEX> (also called the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pa√ßo Real</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Palace</ENAMEX>), easily recognized by its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> huge, white conical chimneys. Used since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 14th century</TIMEX> as a stately <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> home for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">kings</ENAMEX>, its interiors and furnishings are remarkable, including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the oldest and most valuable collections of azulejos to be found in all of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX>.
A steep road of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hairpin</ENAMEX> turns leads up into the serra from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sintra</ENAMEX> to the town‚Äôs most spectacular monuments. The oldest is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Castelo</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dos</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mouros</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moors‚Äô Castle</ENAMEX>), erected during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 8th century</TIMEX> soon after the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Moors</ENAMEX> occupied <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX>. The dauntless <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Afonso Henriques</ENAMEX> conquered it for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christians</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1147</TIMEX>, a major victory in the reconquest of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX>. Those with the energy to do so should climb the ramparts to the top for incredible views of the entire forested area.
On the hilltop further up the same winding <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">over 450 m</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,500 ft</NUMEX>) above sea level, is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pal√°cio da Pena</ENAMEX>, an outrageous Victorian folly built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1840</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> is a bizarre and extravagant cocktail of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gothic</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manueline</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Moorish</ENAMEX> architecture fashioned as a love <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">nest</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Queen Maria II</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1834‚Äì1853</ENAMEX>) and her smitten <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferdinand</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Saxe-Coburg-Gotha</ENAMEX>. Inside, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> are a riot of imaginative, ornate, and in some cases suffocatingly sumptuous, details. 
A short hop from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sintra</ENAMEX> are the attractive village of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colares</ENAMEX>, the beach at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Praia das Ma√ß√£s</ENAMEX>, and the rugged coastline at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cabo da Roca</ENAMEX>, the westernmost point of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> mainland. Sintra‚Äôs helpful tourist information <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>, on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pra√ßa da Rep√</ENAMEX>∫blica in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the old quarter</TIMEX>, can direct you to any of these.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Estoril Coast</ENAMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Costa</ENAMEX> do <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Estoril</ENAMEX> (formerly called the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Costa</ENAMEX> do <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sol</ENAMEX>) begins just west of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lisbon</ENAMEX> and goes all the way around the tip of the peninsula to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guincho</ENAMEX> on the open <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX>. Those seeking pollution-free swimming (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">132</NUMEX>) usually head for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guincho</ENAMEX>, but the famous old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Estoril</ENAMEX> itself, some <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">24 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">15 miles</NUMEX>) from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lisbon</ENAMEX>, is still worth a visit. The beaches and resorts west of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lisbon</ENAMEX> are all accessible by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX> from the capital‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cais do Sodr√</ENAMEX>© <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX>.
While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Estoril</ENAMEX> is a full-scale <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">resort¬†‚Äî¬†cosmopolitan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sybaritic¬†‚Äî¬†Cascais</ENAMEX>, which sits on a pretty curved bay, leads a double life, as a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fishermen</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">kings</ENAMEX>, where the humble and the retiring rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coexist</ENAMEX> with camera-toting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX>.
The main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> is a charmer. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pa√</ENAMEX>ßos do <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Concelho</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Town Hall</ENAMEX>) has stately windows with iron railings, separated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panels</ENAMEX> of azulejos depicting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">saints</ENAMEX>. A forbidding <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">fort</ENAMEX>, known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cidadela</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">citadel</ENAMEX>), is one of the few <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> to have survived the earthquake and tidal wave of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1755</TIMEX>. The municipal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> down the road holds the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museu</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dos</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Condes de Castro Guimar√£es</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> with archaeological remains, art works, old furniture, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">silver</ENAMEX>. 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> west (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 km/2 miles</NUMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cascais</ENAMEX>) passes <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boca</ENAMEX> do <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Inferno</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mouth</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hell</ENAMEX>), a geological curiosity where, in rough weather, the waves send up astonishingly high spouts of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spray</ENAMEX> accompanied by ferocious sound effects. 
At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guincho</ENAMEX>, you have the choice of either a sandy beach or the rocks to fish from, but be careful: They face the open sea and it‚Äôs often rough. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South</ENAMEX> of the Tagus
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ponte 25 de Abril</ENAMEX>, across the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">River Tagus</ENAMEX>, became the longest suspension <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> when it was opened to traffic in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1966</TIMEX>. It leads to several destinations south of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lisbon</ENAMEX> popular with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> and international <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> alike.
The topographical highlight of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arr√°bida</ENAMEX> peninsula is undoubtedly the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Serra da Arr√°bida</ENAMEX> (site of a nature reserve), a mountain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> around <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">35 km</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">22 miles</NUMEX>) long which protects the coast from the strong north winds and accounts for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX> vegetation. The tiny little beach spot, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Portinho da Arr√°bida</ENAMEX>, is popular with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> weekenders. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Set√∫bal</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">district capital</ENAMEX>, is just a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20-minute</TIMEX> drive from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lisbon</ENAMEX> by motorway, longer if you take the picturesque route via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sesimbra</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arr√°bida.</ENAMEX> This is olive and citrus <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cows</ENAMEX> grazing among the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>. Set√∫bal is a conglomeration of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">market town</ENAMEX>, industrial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Portugal‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> largest fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port</ENAMEX>. 
Set√∫bal‚Äôs greatest historical and artistic treasure, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gothic Igreja de Jesus</ENAMEX>, was built around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1490</TIMEX> by the great <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boytac</ENAMEX>, who later built <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Lisbon‚</ENAMEX>Äôs glorious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jer√≥nimos Monastery</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX>). A dramatic main portal leads into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>, which boasts <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> inspired elements of decoration: <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">azulejos</ENAMEX> on the walls, and stone pillars like twisted strands of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">clay</ENAMEX>, fragile-looking in spite of their obviously solid dimensions.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North of Lisbon</ENAMEX>
In modest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX>, the dimensions and extravagance of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">convent</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mafra</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">40 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">25 miles</NUMEX>) to the northwest of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lisbon</ENAMEX>, are quite staggering. The riches are attributable to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jo√£o V</ENAMEX>, who in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1711</TIMEX> conceived this project to celebrate the long-awaited birth of his <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Princess</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">D. Maria</ENAMEX>, after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three years</TIMEX> of marriage. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">convent</ENAMEX> took <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13 years</TIMEX> to build and employed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 50,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time. Its huge cost gave rise to a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> saying that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jo√</ENAMEX>£o transformed the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diamonds</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brazil</ENAMEX> into the rocks of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mafra</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">convent library</ENAMEX> is the undisputed highlight; it has a vaulted ceiling, a precious <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wood</ENAMEX> floor, and tall shelves housing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30,000</NUMEX> books, making it the largest <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-room <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX>. Visits to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Mafra Palace</ENAMEX> are by guided tour only (English-speaking at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">11am and 2:30pm</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX>; closed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX>), and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">last about an hour</TIMEX>.
Another <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6 miles</NUMEX>) to the coast is the fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> and growing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ericeira</ENAMEX>, a natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">port</ENAMEX>. The old section is a winsome <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of cobbled <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> winding between white-washed <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cottages</ENAMEX>, everything clean, neat, and treasured by both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhabitants</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> alike. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Estremadura</ENAMEX> and Ribatejo
The historic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> north of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Lisbon¬†‚Äî¬†Estremadura</ENAMEX>, between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tagus</ENAMEX> river and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">coast</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ribatejo</ENAMEX>, extending into the agricultural central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">plains¬</ENAMEX>†‚Äî¬†possess some of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Portugal‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most important monuments and most interesting and attractive <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX>. 
√ìbidos & the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coast</ENAMEX>
Almost too perfect to be true, the high medieval walls of √ìbidos completely encircle a jewel of a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>. Equally hard to believe, this inland <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> was once a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX> and coastal fortress until the sea inlet here silted up, leaving the quiet √ìbidos lagoon cut off and the shoreline <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">nearly 10 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6 miles</NUMEX>) away. 
Traditionally the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> was given as a wedding gift from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">King of Portugal</ENAMEX> to his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bride</ENAMEX>. An entrance at the north end is guarded by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 13th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX>, which has been adapted as one of the more luxurious and perennially full pousadas (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">174</NUMEX>). The narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> inside the town‚Äôs walls are enchanting, all lined with white-washed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> decorated with colorful <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>. It‚Äôs a safe bet that √ìbidos has never looked so neat and clean in all its history, so it‚Äôs inevitably jammed with curious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> at times. 
At street level, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rua Direita</ENAMEX>, the main drag, runs from one gate to the other. Just down from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX>, the parish <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Igreja de Santa Maria</ENAMEX>, has handsome blue <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">azulejos</ENAMEX>, an odd blue-painted ceiling, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">gilded tomb</ENAMEX> in the north wall. Afonso V married his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cousin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isabel</ENAMEX> in this small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1441</TIMEX>, when they were mere <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> (he was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>, she all of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX>).
Due west on the coast, the old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peniche</ENAMEX> was once an island. The port‚Äôs imposing fortifications were built by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> during its period of rule in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16th century</TIMEX>. The fishing harbor is usually jammed with colorful, storm-battered <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">craft</ENAMEX> and flanked by excellent informal fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">fort</ENAMEX> nearby held political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prisoners</ENAMEX> during the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salazar</ENAMEX> r√©gime; now it‚Äôs a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> as well as a display area for local crafts and traditions. In fine weather you might wish to take a trip to the island of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Berlenga</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">12 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">7 miles</NUMEX>) offshore. With <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monastery</ENAMEX> ruins and an impressive <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">fort</ENAMEX> that still stands, it‚Äôs now a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">sanctuary</ENAMEX> for seabirds.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alcoba√ßa</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Batalha Abbeys</ENAMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">admirable abbeys¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Portugal‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most moving <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">monuments¬†‚Äî¬†are</ENAMEX> found inland north of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">√ìbidos</NUMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> is the former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cistercian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monastery</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mosteiro de Santa Maria de Alcoba√ßa.</ENAMEX> Built to celebrate a victory, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1147</ENAMEX> battle in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dom Afonso Henriques</ENAMEX> took over the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santar√</ENAMEX>©m from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moors</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> remains the largest in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX>. 
In the transept, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 30 m</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">100 ft</ENAMEX>) apart, are the tombs of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Pedro I and In√</ENAMEX>™s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Castro</ENAMEX>, their effigies facing each other and surrounded by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attendant angels</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pedro</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">In√™s</ENAMEX> lived a tragic love story that ended with her <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">murder¬†‚Äî¬†ordered</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pedro‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Afonso IV</ENAMEX>. The lovers‚Äô tombs are decorated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Portugal‚</ENAMEX>Äôs greatest medieval stonecarving. The monastery‚Äôs so-called <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Cloister of Silence</ENAMEX>, ordered by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Dom Dinis</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 14th century</TIMEX>, is a model of harmony and simplicity. 
Farther north (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">16 km/9 miles</NUMEX>) is the even more impressive, many-turreted and buttressed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mosteiro da Batalha</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Battle Monastery</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">King Jo√</ENAMEX>£o I ordered the construction of this Gothic masterpiece in gratitude for the victory over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Juan</ENAMEX> I of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Castile</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Battle of Aljubarrota</ENAMEX> nearby in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1385</TIMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX>). 
In the center of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Capela do Fundador</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Founder‚Äôs Chapel</ENAMEX>), a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tomb</ENAMEX> contains the remains of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jo√£o</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">queen</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philippa</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lancaster</ENAMEX>; their effigies lie side by side, hand in hand. Family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">nearby¬†‚Äî¬†niches</ENAMEX> in the walls hold the tombs of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, most notably that containing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prince</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry the Navigator</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Portugal‚Äôs Unknown Soldiers</ENAMEX> are buried in the monastery‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chapterhouse</ENAMEX>. This vaulted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20 sq m</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">65 sq ft</NUMEX>), was a great engineering wonder in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">its day</TIMEX> (around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1400</TIMEX>). Due to fears that the unsupported ceiling would collapse at any time, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX> is said to have employed only convicts under sentence of death to work on the project.
Be sure not to miss the unfinished chapels, open to the sky, at the east end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> but visited from the outside.
The quintessential fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nazar√©</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Portuguese ‚ÄúNazareth</ENAMEX>,‚Äù is now a thriving commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX>. However, some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fishermen</ENAMEX> here continue to wear the colorful local dress, black stocking-caps and plaid trousers, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> still appear in black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shawls</ENAMEX>, bright aprons, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> petticoats (one for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each day of the week</TIMEX>). 
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S√≠tio</ENAMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">90-m</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">300-ft</ENAMEX>) cliff at the north end of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nazar√©</ENAMEX>, offers an excellent vantage point over the green hilly countryside, the tiled roofs of the neatly packed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">mile</NUMEX> after mile of beach open to the full force of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic Ocean</ENAMEX>.
F√°tima
Set in bleak hill country <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 135 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">84 miles</NUMEX>) north of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lisbon</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F√°tima¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†once just a poor village¬†‚Äî¬†is one of the most important <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> of pilgrimage in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catholic</ENAMEX> world, along with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lourdes</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santiago de Compostela</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>.
On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13 May 1917</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shepherds</ENAMEX> claimed they saw a series of miraculous visions of the Virgin <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary¬†‚Äî¬†said</ENAMEX> to disclose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> secrets, or prophecies, to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">children¬†‚Äî¬†followed</ENAMEX> by a solar phenomenon witnessed by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October of the same year</TIMEX>. (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> died of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pneumonia</ENAMEX> soon after these inexplicable events; the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lucia</ENAMEX>, now in her <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">90s</NUMEX>, has been a cloistered <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Carmelite</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nun</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Coimbra</ENAMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1929</TIMEX> and makes very few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> appearances.)
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">The 20th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">neo-Baroque</ENAMEX> basilica that draws so many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">faithful</ENAMEX>, said to be twice as big as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Peter‚</ENAMEX>Äôs in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX>, faces an immense but rather plain <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>. Pilgrimages are held on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 13th</TIMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every month</TIMEX>, with the most important observances on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that date</TIMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX>. Yet even on an ordinary <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekday</TIMEX>, scattered <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">believers</ENAMEX>, some kneeling in penitence, come to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">F√</ENAMEX>°tima to pay homage to the Virgin <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary</ENAMEX>. 
Tomar
Sitting astride the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">River Nab√£o</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tomar</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">34 km/21 miles</NUMEX> east of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">F√°tima</ENAMEX>) is one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Portugal‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most fascinating <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX>. 
Tomar‚Äôs pleasant central <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pra√ßa da Republica</ENAMEX>, is flanked by the elegant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manueline</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S√£o Jo√£o Baptista</ENAMEX>, with an unusual octagonal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">belfry</ENAMEX> and intricate <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">portico</ENAMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th-century</TIMEX> town hall. The statue in the center of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plaza</ENAMEX> tells the real story of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, though. Beneath a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX> of ever-present pigeons, it depicts <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gualdim Pais</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grand Master of the Portuguese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> of the crusading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Order of the Knights Templar</ENAMEX>, to whom the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> was granted in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1157</TIMEX>.
Unusual for a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> so dominated by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crusaders</ENAMEX>, a small <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sinagoga</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">synagogue</ENAMEX>) survives on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rua</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joaquim Jacinto</ENAMEX>, just off the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> has a high vaulted ceiling, along with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">clay pots</ENAMEX> embedded in the walls to improve the acoustics (classical concerts are now occasionally held here). A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> displays old <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tombstones</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Yom Kippur</ENAMEX> was celebrated here for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">500 years</TIMEX>.
The standout sights, however, are up on the hill above <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Templars‚</ENAMEX>Äô old stronghold, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UNESCO</ENAMEX> World Heritage sites <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Castelo dos Templ√°rios</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Templars‚Äô Castle</ENAMEX>) and the accompanying <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Convento do Cristo</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Convent of Christ</ENAMEX>), overlook <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tomar</ENAMEX> from wooded heights. Behind crenellated walls, the outstanding <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Convento do Cristo</ENAMEX> is one of the highlights of central <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX>.
At the heart of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> is the original <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Templar</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>, the fascinating <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Charola</ENAMEX>, a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>-sided structure based on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Church</ENAMEX> of the Holy Sepulchre (built over <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christ‚Äôs</ENAMEX> tomb) in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jerusalem</ENAMEX>. Knights once attended services here on horseback. In its interior is a gilded octagonal structure, which appears almost more pagan than <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX>-looking. Recently completed restoration has revived the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Charola‚</ENAMEX>Äôs esoteric paintings. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-storied nave, added by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Manuel I</ENAMEX>, is divided into an upstairs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">choir</ENAMEX> and a chapterhouse underneath.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the finest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manueline</ENAMEX> windows in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX> is carved in the western wall of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chapterhouse</ENAMEX>, encrusted with profusely carved marine motifs. The grand Renaissance-style <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Claustro Principal</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Great Cloister</ENAMEX>) was added in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16th century</TIMEX>. 
Halfway up the wooded road to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Convento de Cristo</ENAMEX> is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ermida da Nossa Senhora da Concei√ß√£o</ENAMEX>, a handsome little basilica in classic <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> style.
From <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tomar</ENAMEX> an enjoyable excursion is to the fairytale <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Almourol</ENAMEX>, marooned on an island in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tagus</ENAMEX>. Just upriver is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abrantes</ENAMEX>, with its own <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> overlooking the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Santar√©m</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">78 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">48 miles</NUMEX>) northeast of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lisbon</ENAMEX>, is the ancient capital of the agricultural <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ribatejo</ENAMEX>, whose lifeblood is the mighty River Tagus. 
Few of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santar√</ENAMEX>©m‚Äôs monuments have survived, although the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jesuit</ENAMEX> seminary and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> on the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>, the triangular <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Largo S√° da Bandeira</ENAMEX>, has an impressive <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">baroque fa√ßade</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North</ENAMEX> of the city <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 15th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Igreja de Gra√ßa</ENAMEX>, with its magnificent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gothic</ENAMEX> rose window, amazingly carved from a single piece of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stone</ENAMEX>. In the south of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marvila</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>, built in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manueline</ENAMEX> style, with fine <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">azulejos</ENAMEX>. Across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> is an interesting archaeological <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> in a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Romanesque</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>. 
A fine panoramic view can be had from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Portas do Sol</ENAMEX> miradouro (belvedere), a garden surrounded by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moorish</ENAMEX> walls overlooking the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">River Tagus</ENAMEX> and the extensive plains of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ribatejo</ENAMEX>. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phoenician</ENAMEX> dye <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> was recently discovered on the grounds.
In this agricultural land, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bulls</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX> can be seen grazing all over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ribatejo</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vila Franca de Xira</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">45 km/28 miles</NUMEX> down the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tagus</ENAMEX> in the direction of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lisbon</ENAMEX>) is a modest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, but the center of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> bullfighting. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Every July</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX>, a festival with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pamplona</ENAMEX>-style bull-running through the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> (called a largada) accompanies the bullfights. 
The tranquil <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goleg√</ENAMEX>£ explodes once a year, when the important <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Feira Nacional</ENAMEX> do <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cavalo</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Horse Fair</ENAMEX>) is held in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November</TIMEX>. If you can‚Äôt be here when all the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">breeders</ENAMEX> are, at least have a look at the fine portal of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Igreja Matriz</ENAMEX> and a couple of small art <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX> in town, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> the remarkable <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Museu de Fotografia Carlos Relvas</ENAMEX>.
Numerous migratory <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> can be seen in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tagus Estuary Natural Reserve</ENAMEX>, an important wetlands whose <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX> are in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alcochete</ENAMEX>.
The Beiras
The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> ancient provinces known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beiras</ENAMEX> together make up the broad swathe of land lying between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tagus</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Douro</ENAMEX> rivers. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beiras</ENAMEX> means ‚Äúedge,‚Äù revealing the boundary position these <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">provinces</ENAMEX> have long occupied between northern and southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX>. Each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">provinces</ENAMEX> retains its own distinctive character.
The lovely university <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coimbra</ENAMEX> dominates the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beira Litoral</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coastal Beira</ENAMEX>). The neighboring coastline forms part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Costa de Prata</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Silver Coast</ENAMEX>) and has largely escaped development, though it does have resorts at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Figueira da Foz</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aveiro</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inland</ENAMEX> is the spectacular terrain of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beira Alta</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Upper Beira</ENAMEX>). Small granite hills begin to develop into great mountains dressed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">pine trees</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> is small and the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> few, despite the strange beauty of the landscape, with its giant boulders and flowery meadows. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Serra da Estr√</ENAMEX>™la is the backbone of the area and offers a host of wonderful valleys and waterfalls for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hikers</ENAMEX>, fortified by the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">area‚Äôs fabulous cheese</ENAMEX>.
Further south, the mountains give way to the agricultural plains of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beira Baixa</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lower Beira</ENAMEX>), which lacks the monuments and mountains of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX>, but still maintains an unspoiled way of life.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coimbra</ENAMEX> and Around
The magnificent university <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coimbra</ENAMEX>, the country‚Äôs capital during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 12th and 13th centuries</TIMEX>, has been the pillar of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> intellectual life since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1290</TIMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> it is a lively and prosperous <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, swimming with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>. 
The famous <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Universidade de Coimbra</ENAMEX> is the country‚Äôs oldest. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">university</ENAMEX> sits on top of a hill in the old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, high above the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">River Mondego</ENAMEX>. Wending their way up to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University</ENAMEX> are several small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> that hide rep√∫blicas (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">halls</ENAMEX> of residence similar to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">fraternities</ENAMEX> and sororities) and numerous small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX> that reverberate to the strains of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coimbra‚</ENAMEX>Äôs own distinctive version of fado (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">128</NUMEX>).
The principal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University</ENAMEX> is marked by a belltower and surrounded by historic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sides</ENAMEX>. At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one end</TIMEX> is the spectacular baroque <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Biblioteca Joanina</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX>), constructed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1720</TIMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jo√£o V‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Brazilian</ENAMEX> wealth (also instrumental in building the great <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mafra</ENAMEX>; see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42</NUMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> exquisitely gilded and painted <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chambers</ENAMEX> house <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 300,000</NUMEX> leather-bound texts in many languages. On the same side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX> are the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museu de Arte Sacra</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum of Sacred Art</ENAMEX>), recently closed for restoration, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Capela de S√£o Miguel</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">St. Michael‚Äôs Chapel</ENAMEX>), with fine azulejos and a massive baroque organ. Directly ahead is the highly ornate ceremonial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sala dos Capelos</ENAMEX>, the heart of university life (it‚Äôs where degrees are given out).
The nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museu Nacional de Machado</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Castro</ENAMEX>, housed in the former <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">archbishop‚Äôs palace</ENAMEX>, exhibits an excellent collection of medieval sculpture and religious paintings. Among the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">museum‚Äôs complex</ENAMEX> of historic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> are a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moorish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> crypt in a fascinating warren of underground passages.
On either side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coimbra‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> cathedrals, the classical-baroque <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S√© Nova</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Cathedral</ENAMEX>) and the vastly more interesting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S√© Velha</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Old Cathedral</ENAMEX>). The fine <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Romanesque</ENAMEX> bulk of the old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">cathedral</ENAMEX> is reminiscent of the early crusading cathedrals of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lisbon</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Porto</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> detail has been added around the portals, but the interior remains fairly stark. A chapel to the right contains a collection of impressive life-size <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stone</ENAMEX> carvings of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Twelve Disciples</ENAMEX>. Be sure not to miss the peaceful <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Romanesque</ENAMEX> cloister.
The single-nave <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Igreja de Santa Cruz</ENAMEX>, built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1131</TIMEX>, is renowned for its dazzling Manueline detail, including an elaborate <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">portico</ENAMEX> and carved pulpit. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> holds the tombs of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Portugal‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">kings</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Afonso Henriques</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Sancho I</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Claustro del Silencio</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cloister of Silence</ENAMEX>) is lined with pretty arches and colorful azulejos. Down towards the river, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jardim Bot√¢nico</ENAMEX>, with <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> collected from across <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Portugal‚</ENAMEX>Äôs far-flung <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX>, is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Portugal‚</ENAMEX>Äôs largest. 
Across the river are the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Convento de Santa Clara</ENAMEX>-a-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Velha</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Old St.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Claire Convent</ENAMEX>, long under extensive restoration aimed at rescuing it from the river), where the lifeless <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">In√™s de Castro</ENAMEX> was crowned (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45</NUMEX>), and the newer, uphill <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Convento de Santa Clara</ENAMEX>-a-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nova</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Convent</ENAMEX>), where the silver tomb of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isabel</ENAMEX>, the sainted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">queen</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Dom Dinis</ENAMEX>, is located. Nearby is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quinta das L√</ENAMEX>°grimas estate, now an elegant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">In√™s</ENAMEX> was reputedly murdered. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legend</ENAMEX> holds that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">garden‚Äôs ‚Äúpool</ENAMEX> of tears,‚Äù immortalized in the epic poem by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Luis de Cam√µes</ENAMEX>, is stained deep red by the actual blood of the doomed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lover</ENAMEX>. 
Also on the south side of the river is a good spot for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX> dos <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pequinitos</ENAMEX>, a children‚Äôs theme <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> where many of the country‚Äôs greatest and most typical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> are reproduced in miniature.
Coimbra Environs
Portugal‚Äôs largest and finest <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> ruins lie <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">17 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 miles</NUMEX>) south of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coimbra</ENAMEX>, at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conimbriga</ENAMEX>, close to the pottery <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Condeixa</ENAMEX>-a-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nova</ENAMEX>. Though the extensive site is still being excavated, remnants of fountains, thermal pools, a sophisticated heating system, a large villa, and spectacular colorful <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosaics¬†‚Äî¬†some</ENAMEX> of the finest under roofing at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Casa das Fontes¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†have been unearthed. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conimbriga</ENAMEX> had become a significant <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> bc, though many of the greatest finds here date to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 2nd and 3rd centuries</TIMEX> ad. A large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> displays some of the valuable finds from the area.
Along the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mondego</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">28 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">17 miles</NUMEX>) west of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coimbra</ENAMEX>, is the sturdy and imposing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Montemor-o-Velho</ENAMEX> (the home <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of the wanderer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fern√£o Mendes Pinto</ENAMEX>), affording superb views. Here, too, is the fine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manueline</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santa</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maria de Alc√°√ßova</ENAMEX>, founded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1090</TIMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Portugal‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">forests</ENAMEX>, land that inspires an almost mystical reverence for its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX>, is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">25 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">15 miles</NUMEX>) north of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coimbra</ENAMEX>, at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bu√ßaco.</ENAMEX> The forest is home to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 700</NUMEX> types of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>, and was once the preserve of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Benedictine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monks¬†‚Äî¬†women</ENAMEX> were not allowed to enter. Footpaths meander all over the thick, tranquil forest, ideal for long walks. Tucked within the forest is the celebrated, fantastically ornate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hotel Palace</ENAMEX> do <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bu√ßaco</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">175</NUMEX>), formerly a royal <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> retreat, and a curious stone <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monastery</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mosteiro dos Carmelitas</ENAMEX>. For further relaxation, the nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Luso</ENAMEX> is full of elegant <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">casino</ENAMEX>, and thermal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">spas</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coast</ENAMEX>
The prettiest stretch of coast in the south of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beira Litoral</ENAMEX> is near the ancient pine forest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pinhal de Leiria</ENAMEX>; superb beaches can be found at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S√£o</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pedro de Moel</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">21 km/13 miles</NUMEX> north of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nazar√©</ENAMEX>).
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Figueira da Foz</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">42 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">26 miles</NUMEX>) to the west of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coimbra</ENAMEX> at the mouth of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mondego River</ENAMEX>, has developed from a fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> into a lively resort popular with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX>. The town beach is large, and separate smaller beaches cater to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">surfers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Praia de Mira</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">35 km/22 miles</NUMEX> north of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Figueira</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6 km/4 miles</NUMEX> west of the inland <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mira</ENAMEX>) is located by a small lagoon. Characterized by its wooden <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stilt-houses</ENAMEX>, it lacks the lively nightlife or accommodations of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Figueira</ENAMEX> (camping is available), though it does have unspoiled and uncrowded beaches and dunes.
The main <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> along this stretch of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">coast</ENAMEX> is historic <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aveiro</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">52 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">32 miles</NUMEX>) to the south of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Porto</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">29 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">18 miles</NUMEX>) north of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mira</ENAMEX>. Aveiro‚Äôs unique way of life has developed around its lagoon (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ria</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> was an important <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port</ENAMEX> until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1575</TIMEX>, when a sandbar formed across the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">River Vouga</ENAMEX>, cutting the port off from the sea and creating a vast lagoon. A <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canal</ENAMEX> was cut in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1808</TIMEX>, and the ria was traversed by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX>-style <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canals</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridges</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Municipal Museum</ENAMEX>, in the old <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Convento de Jesus</ENAMEX>, displays religious art, including the massive <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Chapel</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Princesa Santa Joana</ENAMEX>. The tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Rua Jo√£o Mendon√ßa</ENAMEX> can arrange boat trips to explore extensive salt <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pans</ENAMEX> and see the rich variety of birdlife.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beira Alta</ENAMEX>
On the way from Coimbra towards <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Viseu</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">87 km/54 miles</NUMEX> northeast), the land becomes emphatically rural. Small terraced <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">farms</ENAMEX>, accompanied by stone <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>, donkeys, and grape vines, sit among forested hills. This is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">D√£o</ENAMEX> wine region, whose oaky red <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wines</ENAMEX> are named after the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">River D√£o</ENAMEX>, a tributary of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mondego</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viseu</ENAMEX> is a dignified and historic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, supposedly home to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Viriathus</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lusitanian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hero</ENAMEX> who organized the opposition to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> invasion of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">147</NUMEX> bc. The scenic old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> is centered around the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pra√ßa da S√©</ENAMEX>, with its central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pillory</ENAMEX> and wealth of historic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>. The bulky twin-towered cathedral, originally <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Romanesque</ENAMEX>, was redesigned in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th century</TIMEX>. The classical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cloister</ENAMEX> has Ionic columns on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> level and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Doric</ENAMEX> on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>. The other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>, the bright white <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Igreja Miseric√≥rdia</ENAMEX>, features a terrific baroque fa√ßade but an unprepossessing interior.
The top sight in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Viseu</ENAMEX>, and one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Portugal‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most important art <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX>, is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museu de Gr√£o Vasco</ENAMEX>, which inhabits the former <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">archbishop‚Äôs palace</ENAMEX> next to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">cathedral</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vasco Fernandes</ENAMEX>, more commonly referred to as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gr√£o Vasco</ENAMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Great</ENAMEX>), founded the city‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> of painting in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16th century</TIMEX>. Huge, bold panels of his work are on view, including <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúS√£o Pedro</ENAMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚Äù ‚ÄúPentecost,‚Äù</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúAssun√ß√£o da Virgem</ENAMEX>,‚Äù as are those of the various <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Flemish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> who influenced the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viseu School</ENAMEX>, and those of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vasco‚</ENAMEX>Äôs great <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rival</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gaspar Vaz</ENAMEX>. Perhaps the most interesting exhibit is the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>-panel depiction of the life of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christ</ENAMEX>, painted by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gr√£o Vasco</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1501‚Äì1506</NUMEX> and transferred from the altar of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Viseu cathedral</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 18th century</TIMEX>. 
The Planalto
Towards the northeast of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beira Alta</ENAMEX> is the barren plateau of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Planalto (‚ÄúHigh Plain‚Äù</ENAMEX>), a wild, cold, and sparsely populated region, but important enough to have been fought over by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>. The plateau‚Äôs isolation attracted many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> fleeing the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Inquisition</ENAMEX>. The atmospheric walled <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trancoso</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">43 km/26 miles</NUMEX> to the north of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guarda</ENAMEX>) records this heritage in the stone <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">carvings</ENAMEX> above the doorways of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>. From <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">miles</NUMEX> around, you can see the powerful <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> walls and strong keep built by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Dom Dinis</ENAMEX> to fortify the border against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Almeida</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">65 km/40 miles</NUMEX> east) also boasts well-preserved fortifications, a legacy of its position virtually on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> border. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> is enclosed within <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">star</ENAMEX>-shaped fortifications, reminiscent of those at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Elvas</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alentejo</ENAMEX>. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Serra da Estr√</ENAMEX>™la
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Serra da Estr√™la</ENAMEX>, just southwest of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guarda</ENAMEX>, offers <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Portugal‚</ENAMEX>Äôs highest mountains, at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,991</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6,532 ft</NUMEX>), and some fantastic scenery for hiking through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parque Natural</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Natural Park</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seia</ENAMEX> makes a good base to explore the serra, as does <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Penhas da Sa√∫de</ENAMEX>, the site of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Portugal‚</ENAMEX>Äôs only ski <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX>. 
Linhares, which dates to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1169</TIMEX>, is one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Portugal‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most charming <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX>. Its moss-covered stone <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> and tiny cobbled <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> are preserved <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>-like, though it still seems like a real <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Linhares</ENAMEX> boasts a stretch of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> and a scenic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">medieval castle</ENAMEX> with splendid views of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">granite</ENAMEX> peaks and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rio Mondego valley</ENAMEX>. Details of hiking <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">routes</ENAMEX> are available at the tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Guarda</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Covilh√£</ENAMEX>, or at the park information <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gouveia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manteigas</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seia</ENAMEX>.
Some <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">12 miles</NUMEX>) from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guarda</ENAMEX> is tiny <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Belmonte</ENAMEX>, with a carefully restored <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Jewish Quarter</TIMEX>, home to this day to a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Covilh√£</ENAMEX>, a further <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">12 miles</NUMEX>) south, has become a base for exploring the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Serra</ENAMEX> because of its location close to the highest peaks and the ski fields. This mountainous area produced several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">explorers</ENAMEX> who would help form the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">empire</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">From Covilh√£ came P√™ro de Covilh√£</ENAMEX>, who explored <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ethiopia</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 15th century</TIMEX>, and born in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Belmonte</ENAMEX> was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pedro √Ålvares Cabral</ENAMEX>, who discovered <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brazil</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1500</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beira Baixa</ENAMEX>
Throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lower Beira</ENAMEX>, agricultural plains and orchards stretch out between rocky hills and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> of ancient settlements.
The main <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> in the region is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Castelo Branco</ENAMEX>, invaded by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> so often that little of historical interest survives. It is still a pleasant <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, with small cobbled alleyways leading up to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ruined ‚ÄúWhite Castle‚Äù</ENAMEX> at the highest point of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pa√ßo Episcopal</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Bishop‚Äôs Palace</ENAMEX>) is home to a regional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>, displaying a splendid collection of highly elaborate colchas (bedspreads), as well as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16th-century</TIMEX> tapestries. The elegant formal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palace Gardens</ENAMEX> are laid out with an array of baroque statues, sculpted <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">hedges</ENAMEX>, fountains, and pools. The nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Miradouro de S√£o Gens</ENAMEX> affords a good view of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>.
The atmospheric and intensely <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monsanto</ENAMEX>, located <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 50 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">31 miles</NUMEX>) to the northeast of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Castelo Branco</ENAMEX>, balances on a dramatic rocky outcrop between massive boulders. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> are too narrow for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX>, but a short walk to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> at the top is worth the effort for the impressive stonework and the view. A beautiful, but roofless, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Romanesque</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> can also be seen. A new pousada has just opened here.
THE <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NORTH</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Porto</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Douro Valley</ENAMEX>
Portugal‚Äôs prosperous second <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Porto</ENAMEX> (also written <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Oporto</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, meaning ‚Äúthe <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Port‚Äù</ENAMEX>), hugs a gorge at the mouth of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Douro</ENAMEX> river. The former <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> settlement of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Portus</ENAMEX>, it combined with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calus</ENAMEX>, its twin <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> on the opposite <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX>, to become known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Portucale</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early Middle Ages</TIMEX>. 
Despite its history and economic importance, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Porto</ENAMEX> is industrious and less self-conscious than <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lisbon</ENAMEX>. Even with splendid <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridges</ENAMEX> crossing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Douro</ENAMEX> and a red-roofed jumble of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> creeping up the hillside, its attractions are less obvious than the capital‚Äôs. Still, many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> develop a real attraction to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. Walking is the best way to explore it, despite the many hills that spill down to the river. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> has a new sense of vitality, with a spate of new architecture, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">art galleries</ENAMEX> and chic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>. Porto was named <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Capital of Culture</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>.
The river that flows all the way to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> border has always been the source of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Porto‚</ENAMEX>Äôs wealth. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Douro snakes</ENAMEX> past the terraced <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">vineyards</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Douro Valley</ENAMEX>. Those vineyards produce fine table <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wines</ENAMEX> and, most famously, the rich fortified <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> known as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">port</ENAMEX> (which took its name from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>). Traditionally <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">port wine</ENAMEX> was shipped downriver in oak barrels loaded on barcos rabelos (flat-bottomed square-sailed <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX>) to be stored in the cool and damp <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port lodges</ENAMEX> (merchants‚Äô <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">warehouses</ENAMEX>) in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Vila Nova de Gaia</ENAMEX>, across the river from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Porto</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wines</ENAMEX> are still stored there, even though they are now transported by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">truck</ENAMEX>.
Porto
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, which began down by the river, has expanded considerably beyond the old walls. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pra√ßa da Liberdade</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Liberty Square</ENAMEX>) in the upper level now marks the center of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>. Not far from here is the main tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>, up Avenida dos <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aliados</ENAMEX> and beside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">City Hall</ENAMEX>, at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Rua Clube Fenianos 25</ENAMEX>. For a splendid view over <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Porto‚</ENAMEX>Äôs colorful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">jumble</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> and crumbling facades, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> west out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pra√ßa</ENAMEX>, down <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Rua Cl√©rigos</ENAMEX>, and climb the church belltower of the imposing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baroque Igreja de Cl√©rigos.</ENAMEX> 
A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">blocks</ENAMEX> east of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> (and south of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pra√ßa da Liberdade</ENAMEX>) is the airy and ornate <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Esta√ß√£o de S√£o Bento</ENAMEX>, far too handsome to be a mere railway <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hub</ENAMEX>. Completed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1916</TIMEX>, its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lobby</ENAMEX> is decorated with wonderful azulejo (tile) panels depicting important scenes from the city‚Äôs history, making it a legitimate tourist attraction.
Just south of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">railway station</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cathedral District</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">The 12th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Romanesque S√</ENAMEX>© (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cathedral</ENAMEX>) is bare and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">austere¬†‚Äî¬†more fortress</ENAMEX> than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 18th century</TIMEX>, an attempt was made to improve its plodding appearance with some baroque additions, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> remains rather lifeless. Inside the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">cathedral</ENAMEX>, a beautiful baroque silver altarpiece is worth a look, as is the rose window. Within these granite walls, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jo√</ENAMEX>£o I married his <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bride</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philippa</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lancaster</ENAMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1387</TIMEX> (the scene is depicted in azulejos in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">S√£o Bento</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">railway station</ENAMEX>), thus sealing the ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">alliance</ENAMEX> between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">England¬†‚Äî¬†an</ENAMEX> alliance with particular strength in Porto due to the overwhelming <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> involvement in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">port wine</ENAMEX> trade.
Nearby, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Casa-Museu Guerra Junqueiro</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guerra Junqueiro Museum</ENAMEX>) on <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Rua de Dom Hugo</ENAMEX> is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 18th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poet</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guerra Junqueiro</ENAMEX>. The charming <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> displays his furniture and collection of art. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Clara</ENAMEX>, a bit east of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">cathedral</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Largo</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1 de Dezembro</ENAMEX>, remains a bit of a secret and a little difficult to find. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> on the exterior and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rococo</ENAMEX> within, its exuberantly carved interior is definitely worth seeking out.
The riverside quay, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cais da Ribeira</ENAMEX>, is an intriguing and slightly grungy area popular with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diners</ENAMEX>. The old docks hold innumerable seafood <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>. Tour <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> tie up here and offer short river tours, beneath the city‚Äôs scenic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridges</ENAMEX>, as well as week-long trips up the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Douro</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">R√©gua</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">67</NUMEX>). The impressive <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ponte Dom Lu√≠s I</ENAMEX> (a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">172-m</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX> built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1886</TIMEX>) looms over the colorful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ribeira</ENAMEX> and spans the river to the south <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX>, where the port <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">lodges</ENAMEX> (cavas) of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vila Nova de Gaia</ENAMEX> are located (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">59</NUMEX>). 
Just uphill from the river is the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bolsa</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">district</ENAMEX>, named after the elegant <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19th-century</TIMEX> Stock Exchange on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pra√</ENAMEX>ßa do <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Infante Dom Henrique</ENAMEX>. The ornate <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Neo-Classical</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> no longer functions as a stock exchange, but guided tours show <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> around the opulent interior. The highlight is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sal√£o √Årabe</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arab Room</ENAMEX>), where the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moorish</ENAMEX> style of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alhambra</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Granada</ENAMEX> was lavishly recreated.
Next door is the city‚Äôs finest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Igreja de S√£o Francisco</ENAMEX>, on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rua do Infante D. Henrique</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Conventionally Gothic</ENAMEX> on the outside, the church‚Äôs interior is like an explosion in a gold <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factory</ENAMEX>. Gilded rococo details swathe the walls from ground to ceiling. The most impressive feature is the ‚ÄúTree of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesse</ENAMEX>,‚Äù an elaborately carved, gilded and painted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th-century</TIMEX> wood sculpture on the northern wall. The attention-getting piece depicts the family geneaology of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christ</ENAMEX>. Opposite the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> is a small but interesting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> with relics of the old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monastery</ENAMEX> and catacombs.
Also near the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bolsa</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Casa do Infante</ENAMEX>, supposedly the site, if not the actual <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry the Navigator</ENAMEX> was born (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>). This entire <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">block</ENAMEX> was recently under extensive restoration to become a large city <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Citizens</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Porto</ENAMEX> are very proud of their association with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry</ENAMEX>, especially since their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> was where the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">fleet</ENAMEX> for the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1415</TIMEX> assault on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ceuta</ENAMEX> was fitted out. For this patriotic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">venture</ENAMEX> against the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Moors of North Africa</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Porto</ENAMEX> surrendered the finest cuts of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meat</ENAMEX> in their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">navy</ENAMEX> and lived on tripe instead, thus earning their honorable nickname of tripeiros (literally ‚Äútripe <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">eaters</ENAMEX>,‚Äù as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Porto</ENAMEX> are commonly known).
Some of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Porto‚</ENAMEX>Äôs other interesting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX> are northwest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town center</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museu Soares</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dos</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reis</ENAMEX> (on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rua Dom Manuel II</ENAMEX>) is a wonderful collection of fine art housed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">an 18th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Pal√°cio dos Carrancas</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 15th</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 20th centuries</TIMEX> are well represented, including paintings by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Josefa de √ìbidos</ENAMEX> and sculptures by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Soares dos Reis</ENAMEX>. Look for his <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O Desterrado</ENAMEX>, a thoughtful work in marble. Also on display are goods that once formed the basis of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> trade with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Orient</ENAMEX>, especially <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ceramics</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museu Rom√¢ntico/Solar</ENAMEX> do <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vinho do Porto</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Romantic Museum</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Port Institute</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quinta da Macieirinha</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Rua Entre-Quintas 220</ENAMEX> (west of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cl√©rigos</ENAMEX>), displays a collection of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19th-century</TIMEX> art and furniture in the last home of the deposed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">King of Sardinia</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Downstairs</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Solar</ENAMEX> do <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vinho do Porto</ENAMEX>, where you will find <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of port vintages waiting to be sampled.
Further removed but well worth seeking out if you have an interest in modern art and architecture, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Funda√ß√£o Serralves</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rua D. Jo√£o de Castro</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">210</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 3 km/2 miles</NUMEX> west of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Torre de Cl√©rigos</ENAMEX>) has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> primary parts. One is a stark modern <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">shell</ENAMEX> built by the famed local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect √Ålvaro</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Siza Vieira</ENAMEX> and the other a fabulous pink 1930s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Art Deco</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>, surrounded by lovely gardens and a park populated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">goats</ENAMEX>. Both exhibition spaces house temporary shows by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> and international contemporary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vila Nova de Gaia</ENAMEX>
The lower level of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Dom Lu√≠s I Bridge</ENAMEX> leads to the wine cellars of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vila Nova de Gaia</ENAMEX>, which are the low <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> on the southern <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX>. The familiar and less familiar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> names¬†‚Äî¬†such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Taylor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Osborne</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ramos Pinto¬†‚Äî¬†appear</ENAMEX> painted in white and neon signs on the roofs. From the upper level of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX> is a wonderful view of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> on both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX>.
Although it is no longer required by law, most <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port</ENAMEX> is still blended, stored, and aged in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">port wine</ENAMEX> lodges of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gaia</ENAMEX> (as the riverfront <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> is commonly called). Almost all were founded after the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Treaty of Methuen</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1703</TIMEX>, under which the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> agreed to reduce the tariffs on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">port wine</ENAMEX> imports. Most winemaker <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> offer free tours of their lodges, explaining the production process, types of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">port</ENAMEX>, and the effects of river floods, and offer visitors a free sample. Whether you tour one of the large-scale international <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port producers</ENAMEX> (such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sandeman</ENAMEX>) or the smaller, more intimate lodges of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> family-owned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cal√</ENAMEX>©m or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fonseca</ENAMEX>, a visit is a good introduction to the wonders of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">port</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coastal Excursions Near</ENAMEX> Porto
Porto‚Äôs nearest beaches lie to the west, where the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Douro</ENAMEX> passes a large sandbar and meets the sea at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Foz do Douro</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mouth</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Douro</ENAMEX>). In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th century</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Foz</ENAMEX> was a very popular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX>, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> is now heavily polluted. Nevertheless, the beaches and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> still make an enjoyable day out, and a scenic old tram (number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>) provides excursions from the resort to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Castelo do Queijo</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cheese Castle</ENAMEX>).
Further north, the beach <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minho‚Äôs Costa Verde</ENAMEX> are at least clean, even if none too warm. The nearest <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Porto</ENAMEX> is the twin <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> area of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vila</ENAMEX> do <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conde/P√≥voa de Varzim</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">27 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">16 miles</NUMEX>) to the north. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vila do Conde</ENAMEX> is the decidedly more pleasant and less developed of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">P√≥voa do Varzim</ENAMEX> is a short walk north from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vila</ENAMEX> do <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conde</ENAMEX>, but is a much livelier and more built-up <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX>, with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">casino</ENAMEX>. An interesting diversion inland from here is to Rates, where you can add a dash of culture to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the days</TIMEX> spent on the beach by looking around the beautiful <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Romanesque</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Douro Valley</ENAMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Douro Valley</ENAMEX> extending along the river east toward the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> border is one of the most attractive regions in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX>, sprinkled with small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX>, impressive quintas (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agricultural estates</ENAMEX>), and beautifully terraced <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">vineyards</ENAMEX> that dramatically hug the river as it courses through the valley. Cruises run from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ribeira</ENAMEX> waterfront in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Porto</ENAMEX>, up to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">R√©gua</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pinh√£o</ENAMEX>, some lasting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a day</TIMEX> and others an entire week. Others run <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between Pinh√</NUMEX>£o all the way to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pocinho</ENAMEX>, near the border with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>. Alternatively, you can travel up or down the length of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Douro Valley</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">train¬†‚Äî¬†a spectacular ride¬†‚Äî¬†or meander</ENAMEX> through the region by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>. For additional information, contact the tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Porto</ENAMEX>.
Upriver from the sandbank at its mouth, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Douro</ENAMEX> runs between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Porto</ENAMEX> and the port <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">lodges</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vila Nova de Gaia</ENAMEX>, passing beneath a series of impressive <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridges</ENAMEX> and on towards <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">port-wine</ENAMEX> territory. The railway line from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Porto</ENAMEX> skips the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">60 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">37 miles</NUMEX>) of the river¬†‚Äî¬†but this is the least interesting stretch. The line eventually joins the river near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ribadouro</ENAMEX>, proceeding along the northern <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX>, past small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">fields</ENAMEX> where the haystacks, set on cross-shaped supports, look from a distance like scarecrows.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Attractive Amarante</ENAMEX> sits on a gorge of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T√¢mega</ENAMEX> (a tributary of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Douro</ENAMEX>) and makes a good stop if you are driving along the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Porto towards Mes√£ Frio and R√©gua</ENAMEX>. Baronial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansions</ENAMEX> with gaily painted balconies overlooking the river line the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>. Rising above a handsome stone arched <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">leafy park</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> of the former <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monastery</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S√£o Gon√</ENAMEX>ßalo is well worth a visit, especially if you are looking for love: It hosts a pilgrimage in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June</TIMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> seeking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husbands</ENAMEX> (with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> of phallic-shaped cakes‚Äîa remarkably literal step in the mating dance).
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">river bends</ENAMEX> and twists, widens and narrows among green terraced hills. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port</ENAMEX> trade prompted the growth of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peso da R√©gua</ENAMEX> (usually called just <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">R√©gua</ENAMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">70 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">43 miles</NUMEX>) east of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Porto</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">R√©gua</ENAMEX> was once the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX> used to ship young <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wines</ENAMEX> downriver in barcos rabelos (flat-bottomed wooden <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX>) to <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Vila Nova de Gaia</ENAMEX>. Though the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">railways</ENAMEX> took over for transport from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pinh√£o</ENAMEX> (at the confluence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Douro and Pinh√</ENAMEX>£o rivers), and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> goes mostly by <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">R√©gua</ENAMEX> remains an important transportation and commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hub</ENAMEX>.
What the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> lacks in beauty it makes up for in industry. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">port winemakers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Casa do Douro</ENAMEX>, remains in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">R√©gua</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> can pick up a map of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Port Wine Route</ENAMEX> there). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sandeman</ENAMEX> operates a large modern <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">winery</ENAMEX> just across the river, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cockburns</ENAMEX> is up the hill overlooking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">R√©gua.</ENAMEX> 
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mes√£o Frio</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">12 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">7 miles</NUMEX>) west of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">R√©gua</ENAMEX>, is the gateway to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Douro</ENAMEX>. Sitting high above the river, amidst the rambling hills of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Serra do Mar√£o</ENAMEX>, it is an excellent place to relax. There are a number of beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solares</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">manor houses</ENAMEX>), some of which offer accommodations.
The prettiest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> in the area is the affluent <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">center</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lamego</ENAMEX>, south of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Douro</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">13 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">8 miles</NUMEX>) from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">R√©gua.</ENAMEX> Although technically part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beiras</ENAMEX> region, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lamego‚</ENAMEX>Äôs soul belongs to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Douro</ENAMEX>. As well as growing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">grapes</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">port</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lamego</ENAMEX> also produces a fine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">champagne</ENAMEX>-like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Raposeira</ENAMEX>. Lamego was once a pilgrimage <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>, a heritage reflected in one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Portugal‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most famous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Baroque Nossa Senhora dos Rem√©dios</ENAMEX> and the stunning stone staircase that climbs the hill. Inspired by another <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrine</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bom Jesus</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">76</NUMEX>) near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Braga</ENAMEX>, the monumental staircase is lined with statues, azulejos, fountains, and chapels. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">penitents</ENAMEX> still heroically climb the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">600-plus</NUMEX> steps on their knees, especially during the great <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> pilgrimage on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lamego</ENAMEX> has a wealth of handsome <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Baroque</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansions</ENAMEX>, as well as a scenic <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> and a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">S√©</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cathedral</ENAMEX>) with a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museu de Lamego</ENAMEX> in the old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bishop‚Äôs palace</ENAMEX> houses a fine collection of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Flemish</ENAMEX> tapestries and religious statues, as well as paintings by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gr√£o Vasco of the Viseu</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">56</NUMEX>).
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pinh√£o</ENAMEX>, upriver from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">R√©gua</ENAMEX> (both the train trip and drive along the river in this stretch are stunning), is an enjoyable little <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> with deep connections to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">port wine</ENAMEX> trade. The tiny <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train station</ENAMEX> displays azulejos depicting the harvest, and many important quintas owned by the biggest <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">port</ENAMEX> concerns, as well as independently owned <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">vineyards</ENAMEX>, hug the hills near here. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Taylor</ENAMEX>, one of the major wine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">players</ENAMEX>, recently opened an excellent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pinh√£o</ENAMEX>, the appropriately named <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Vintage House</ENAMEX>. 
From <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pinh√</ENAMEX>£o to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pocinho</ENAMEX>, the train snakes along the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Douro‚</ENAMEX>Äôs switchbacks with stunning views at every turn (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 hours</TIMEX> roundtrip). Another good route is north to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tua</ENAMEX>. If you want to get closer to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> production, you‚Äôll need to have a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> or arrange a tour with one of the quintas or local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX>. Other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> ensconced in the craggy green hills and pretty terraced <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">vineyards</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alij√≥, S√£o Jo√</ENAMEX>£o <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">da Pesqueira</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sabrosa</ENAMEX>. 
Having little to do with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX>, but plenty to do with the historic underpinnings of this region, are the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">archaeological park</ENAMEX> and sublime <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Paleolithic</ENAMEX> rock drawings near <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vila Nova de Foz C√¥a</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">8 km/5 miles</NUMEX> south of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pocinho</ENAMEX>). Discovered only in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX>, the engravings of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">deer</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">goats</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX> constitute the largest outdoor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Paleolithic</ENAMEX> rock art in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. Visits are by guided tour only, through the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">foundation</ENAMEX> overseeing the project. Attendance is strictly limited, and slots to visit the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> are often reserved <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX> in advance. Visit the Web site of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Parque Arqueol√≥gico do C√¥a</ENAMEX> <www.ipa.min-cultura.pt/coa> to arrange visits in advance, or stop by the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vila Nova de Foz C√¥a</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Av</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gago Coutinho</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> A; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tel</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">351/279 768 260/1</NUMEX>). Visits last <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a couple of hours</TIMEX> (to each site, arranged separately) and transportation to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> is included. 
The Minho
The lush northwestern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Minho</ENAMEX> north of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Porto</ENAMEX> is one of the most beautiful regions of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX>. The intensely green area is renowned for its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">mountains</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">forests</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">vinho verde (‚Äúgreen wine‚Äù</ENAMEX>), and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Costa Verde (‚ÄúGreen Coast‚Äù</ENAMEX>).
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Portugal</ENAMEX> originated in this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">corner</ENAMEX> just below <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Galicia</ENAMEX>, the one-time <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Celtic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">settlement</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>. It was recaptured from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moors</ENAMEX> early in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian Reconquest</ENAMEX> campaign and, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Afonso Henriques</ENAMEX> declared himself the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1139</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Minho</ENAMEX> became the independent <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Portucale</ENAMEX> (covering an area from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Douro</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">River Minho</ENAMEX>). Numerous splendid monuments survive in two beautiful historic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guimar√£es</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Braga</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> is reputed to be one of the most religious and conservative in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX>. 
Guimar√£es
A large sign in the center of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guimar√£es</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">49 km/30 miles</NUMEX> northeast of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Porto</ENAMEX>) declares <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚ÄúAqui Nasceu Portugal‚Äù (‚ÄúHere</ENAMEX> was born <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Portugal‚Äù</ENAMEX>), testament to the historic nature of this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medieval gem</ENAMEX> of a small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. 
The city‚Äôs compact yet sturdy <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> seems to have grown out of the rocky hillock. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Seven</NUMEX> towers protect a large central keep lined with unusual triangular battlements that look like serrated teeth. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Afonso Henriques</ENAMEX>, the first <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">King of Portugal</ENAMEX>, is said to have been born in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> and baptized nearby, in the small <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Romanesque</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Igreja de S√£o Miguel do Castelo</ENAMEX>.
Just down the hill is the massive <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Pa√</ENAMEX>ßo dos <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Duques de Bragan√ßa</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ducal Palace</ENAMEX>), a mix between a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ch√¢teau</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">crusader castle</ENAMEX>. Once the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">home</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dukes of Bragan√ßa</ENAMEX>, it fell into disrepair and was reconstructed from ruin in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1930s</TIMEX>. Though the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reconstruction</ENAMEX> is not historically accurate, a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">45-minute</TIMEX> tour of the interior is interesting for the large collection of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antiques</ENAMEX>.
The historic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city center</ENAMEX> runs down the hill from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> along the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rua de Santa Maria</ENAMEX> to a series of beautiful medieval squares surrounded by old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">townhouses</ENAMEX>. The triangular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Largo de Santiago</ENAMEX> is flanked by the arcaded <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Old Town Hall</ENAMEX> and a series of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">townhouses</ENAMEX> converted into the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pousada da Oliveira inn</ENAMEX>.
Through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arcades</ENAMEX> is the central <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Largo da Oliveira</ENAMEX>, where the excellent <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Museu Alberto Sampaio</ENAMEX> is located in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nossa Senhora da Oliveira</ENAMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Collegiate Church of Our Lady of the Olive Tree</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum houses</ENAMEX> stone carvings from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">convent</ENAMEX> in a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cloister</ENAMEX>, as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ceramics</ENAMEX>, and religious items. There is also a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">room</ENAMEX> devoted to the battle of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aljubarrota</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX>); exhibits include the shirt worn by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jo√</ENAMEX>£o I during the fray.
The other notable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Guimar√</ENAMEX>£es is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museu de Martins Sarmento</ENAMEX>, named for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">excavator</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cit√¢nia de Briteiros</ENAMEX>, an ancient settlement of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Celto-Iberians</ENAMEX>. Artifacts displayed, recovered from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Briteiros</ENAMEX> and other sites, include carved stone <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lintels</ENAMEX>, tools, and several fascinating sculptures, such as the enormous pre-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman Colossus</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pedralva</ENAMEX>.
In the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Penha Hills</ENAMEX> above the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> is the lovely <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mosteiro de Santa Marinha da Costa</ENAMEX>, founded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 12th century</TIMEX>. This lovely former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monastery</ENAMEX> has been remarkably restored to form one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Portugal‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most evocative pousadas. The views of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guimar√</ENAMEX>£es down the hill are outstanding. The most enjoyable way up to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Penha</ENAMEX>, which is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 miles</NUMEX>) by <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>, is to take the fast <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">telef√©rico</ENAMEX> (cable <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>). Catch it at the end of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rua de Doutor Jos√© Sampaio</ENAMEX>. 
Near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Guimar√</ENAMEX>£es
Just <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">15 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">9 miles</NUMEX>) from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guimar√</ENAMEX>£es on the way to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Braga</ENAMEX> is the prehistoric site of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Briteiros</ENAMEX>, set on a rocky hillside overlooking a series of valleys and forested hills. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Inhabited by Celt-Iberians</ENAMEX> from around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 4th century</TIMEX> bc to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 4th century</TIMEX> ad, the entire hillside is covered with the remains of the best-preserved cit√¢nia (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Celtic</ENAMEX> hill settlement) in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX>. The walls of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than a hundred</NUMEX> circular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> are visible¬†‚Äî¬†two have been rebuilt to give an idea of what the settlement once looked like¬†‚Äî¬†in addition to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX>, drainage channels, and a defensive wall. A hike downhill leads to a mysterious structure that has been interpreted both as a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">burial chamber</ENAMEX> and as a bath <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> (it now appears to be the latter). The most impressive artifacts from the site can be viewed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Martins Sarmento Museum</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guimar√£es.</ENAMEX>
Braga
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gracious</ENAMEX> and bustling <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Braga</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">22 km/13 miles</NUMEX> northwest of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guimar√£es</ENAMEX>) is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 12th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ecclesiastical center</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> famous for its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holy Week</ENAMEX> celebrations (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">136</NUMEX>). It has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 30</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX> to bolster its religious reputation. The old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, which is peppered with several fine <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">turn-of-the-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">caf√</ENAMEX>©s on or near <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Pra√ßa Rep√∫blica</ENAMEX> (including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caf√© Astoria</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A Brasileira</ENAMEX>), is a delight to wander around.
The original <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Romanesque</ENAMEX> exterior of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S√©</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cathedral</ENAMEX>) has been embellished over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</TIMEX> in a number of styles. Inside are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> extravagant golden organs, replete with trumpets, a carved <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">choir</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brazil</ENAMEX> wood, and a painted ceiling flanking the nave near the entrance. The true wealth of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Archbishopric of Braga</ENAMEX>, though, can be glimpsed in the cathedral‚Äôs stunning but somewhat disheveled <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Museu de Arte Sacra</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum of Religious Art</ENAMEX>), crammed with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX> and silver pieces, including the cross that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cabral</ENAMEX> took on his pioneering voyage to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brazil</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1500</TIMEX>, polychromatic figures, and azulejos. Across a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX> are <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of 14th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chapels</ENAMEX>, one with a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tomb</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> of the first <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">King of Portugal</ENAMEX> and the other a mummified <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">archbishop</ENAMEX> who died in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1397</TIMEX>.
The pedestrian-only <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rua do Souto</ENAMEX> runs right through the middle of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, passing the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> of the former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Archbishop‚Äôs Palace</ENAMEX>, nowadays a library, and an old medieval keep. Before reaching the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pra√ßa da Republica</ENAMEX>, you will find the tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>, housed in a marvelous art deco <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Braga</ENAMEX> is known for its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX>, but it has many splendid <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Baroque</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansions</ENAMEX> as well. Just west of city <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palacio dos Biscainhos</ENAMEX>, built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th century</TIMEX> (the decoration is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th-century</TIMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> reflects the refined lifestyle enjoyed by the nobility, with azulejo panels showing falconry, displays of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">porcelain</ENAMEX>, and delightful gardens. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South of Pra√</ENAMEX>ßa <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">da Rep√∫blica</ENAMEX>, the magnificently blue-tiled <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Casa do Raio</ENAMEX>, known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Casa do Mexicano</ENAMEX>, is now a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>. 
Beyond <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Braga</ENAMEX> is one of the north‚Äôs most frequently photographed sights, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 18th-century</TIMEX> pilgrimage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bom Jesus</ENAMEX> do <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Monte</ENAMEX>, situated in the mountains <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 miles</NUMEX>) east of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Braga</ENAMEX>. The twin-towered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baroque</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> is principally notable for the grand staircase that leads up to it. It is lined with chapels featuring the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stations of the Cross</ENAMEX>, lichen-covered statues, urns, and fountains. The devout climb all the way up on their knees; the less committed can walk or take the funicular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">railway</ENAMEX> and stay in one of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> located at the top.
Barcelos
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">West of Braga</ENAMEX> toward the coast is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barcelos</ENAMEX>, home of the country‚Äôs largest agricultural fair (held <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every Thursday</TIMEX> in the massive open <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Campo da Rep√∫blica</ENAMEX>). Every kind of animal and myriad produce from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Minho</ENAMEX> is on sale, as well as the famous pottery and handicrafts of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barcelos</ENAMEX>.
In one corner of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> is the beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nossa Senhor Bom Jesus da Cruz</ENAMEX>, an octagonal baroque <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>. The old part of town continues on down to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">River C√°vado</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Palace of the Counts</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barcelos</ENAMEX> overlooks the river, but was abandoned after the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">1755 earthquake</ENAMEX>. Its shell now houses the various stone artifacts making up the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museu Arqueol√≥gico</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Minho Coast</ENAMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minho‚Äôs Costa Verde</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Green Coast</ENAMEX>) is low-key compared with the crowded beaches of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve</ENAMEX>. Beautiful beaches run in a virtually unbroken sweep from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Porto</ENAMEX> all the way up to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Galician</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX>) border on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">River Minho</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> isn‚Äôt overly touristed, though; it isn‚Äôt unusual to see oxen pulling <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">carts</ENAMEX> piled high with seaweed for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fertilizer</ENAMEX>.
The only major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> along this coastline is the splendid <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Viana do Castelo</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">60 km/38 miles</NUMEX> north of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Porto</ENAMEX>), which is much more than just beaches. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viana</ENAMEX> is bounded by the estuary of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">River Lima</ENAMEX> to the south and by the wooded <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Monte de Santa Luzia</ENAMEX> to the north. The triangular <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pra√ßa da Rep√</ENAMEX>∫blica forms the center of the historic old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, around which are a series of pal√°cios constructed during <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Viana‚</ENAMEX>Äôs heyday in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 15th century</TIMEX> as a bacalhau fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">center</ENAMEX>. Especially interesting are the fine <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance Miseric√≥rdia</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Almshouse</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gothic Igreja Matriz</ENAMEX>.
Rising above <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viana</ENAMEX> is the scenic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Monte de Santa Luzia</ENAMEX>. Like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bom Jesus</ENAMEX>, it has a pilgrimage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> on the summit and a funicular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">railway</ENAMEX>, though no grand staircase. Though the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> itself isn‚Äôt remarkable, the views from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plaza</ENAMEX> in front take in the north and south coast, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">River Lima</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viana</ENAMEX> itself. There is also a fine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">177</NUMEX>) and an excavated <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">cit√¢nia</NUMEX> (pre-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> hillfort) faintly reminiscent of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Briteiros</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">73</NUMEX>).
Viana‚Äôs main beach lies to the south, across the estuary at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Praia do Cabedelo</ENAMEX>, accessible by ferry or <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road bridge</ENAMEX>. Heading north along the coast from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Viana</ENAMEX> there is little sand, but the rocks are popular for fishing. The small, quaint resort <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vila Praia de √Çncora</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">16 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 miles</NUMEX>) further up the coast.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">River Lima</ENAMEX>
Inland from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Viana do Castelo</ENAMEX>, the beautiful flat <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lima Valley</ENAMEX> runs east through a gentle agricultural landscape dotted with haystacks. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Romans</ENAMEX> settled this attractive area and built a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ponte de Lima</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">23 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">14 miles</NUMEX>) upstream from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Viana</ENAMEX>. A <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX> (ponte) still spans the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lima</ENAMEX>, though the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> is perhaps better known for its ancient bi-monthly market. The hills on the north side offer scenic walks, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ponte de Lima</ENAMEX> has an excellent choice of accommodations in old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">manor houses</ENAMEX>, part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Turismo de Habita√ß√£o</ENAMEX> plan (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Accommodations</ENAMEX>, page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">147</NUMEX>).
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ponte de Barca</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">18 km/11 miles</NUMEX> further east along the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lima</ENAMEX>) is also an appealing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Home</ENAMEX> to a fine <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX>, it also hosts a bi-monthly market by the river. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> serves as a good base for some pleasant hill walks, past small, unspoiled <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Minho</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Peneda-Ger√™s National Park</ENAMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lima Valley</ENAMEX> continues east towards the river‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>, passing through the wild and wonderful <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Peneda-Ger√™s National Park</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> is one of the most visited parts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Minho</ENAMEX>, yet it is very easy to hike up into the mountains and find yourself alone with the mountain <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">goats</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> boasts mountains, river valleys, megalithic monuments (antas), waterfalls, and small mountain <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">hamlets</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Fifteen</NUMEX> species of wild <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> are unique to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>. Numerous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tracks</ENAMEX> crisscross the area, passing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">reservoirs</ENAMEX> that are perfect for a dip after a long day‚Äôs hike.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> is divided into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> parts: the much-visited <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Serra do Ger√™s</ENAMEX>, and the quieter, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">wilder Serra da Peneda</ENAMEX> to the north. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Caldas do Ger√</ENAMEX>™s is the principal tourist base, a slightly tattered <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">spa</ENAMEX> town. Hiking advice is available from the park information <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>, and the tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> can provide details of local accommodations and outdoor activities, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horse</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trekking</ENAMEX>. The nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miradouro do Ger√™s</ENAMEX> has a splendid view over much of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>. 
The best approach to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">northern Peneda</ENAMEX> section of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> is from either <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mon√ß√£o</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Melga√ßo</ENAMEX>, on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">River Minho</ENAMEX>. The main point of access for the eastern part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Caldas do Ger√™s</ENAMEX>, but there is another fascinating route starting from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chaves</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">83</NUMEX>), in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tr√</ENAMEX>°s-os-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Montes</ENAMEX>, that crosses a truly remote area passing by the gigantic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pis√µes</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dam</ENAMEX>.
The River Minho
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">River Minho</ENAMEX> forms the northern border between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Minho</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Galicia</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>). Its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX> are lined by numerous beautiful walled <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> and powerful fortresses. The charming <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vila Nova de Cerveira</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 20 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">12 miles</NUMEX>) northeast from the coastal <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vila Praia de √Çncora</ENAMEX>, is typical of them, with thick town walls and a regular ferry service across the river to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>. Inside the walls of the old fortress is a luxurious pousada.
Farther upriver, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Valen√ßa do Minho</ENAMEX> boasts dramatic and powerful defensive walls (also housing a pousada). Within is a well-preserved <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of winding <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> and quaint <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Tr√°s-os-Montes</ENAMEX>
The name given <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tr√°s-os-Montes¬†‚Äî¬†literally</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚ÄúBeyond the Mountains‚Äù¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†suggests how remote, and even forgotten, it is, even in this small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. Portugal‚Äôs poorest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> is one of deep river valleys separated by rocky hilltops and dense forests. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> retains a sleepy medieval air. Some modernization is occurring thanks to development funds from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Union</ENAMEX> and the influence of returning <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">migrants</ENAMEX>, but the countryside is still dominated by a traditional agricultural and peasant way of life.
The land is divided by temperature: the northern part, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Terra Fria (‚ÄúCold Land‚Äù</ENAMEX>), experiences very harsh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winters</TIMEX>, while <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Terra Quente (‚ÄúHot Land‚Äù</ENAMEX>) is more temperate, containing large <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">vineyards</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Upper Douro Valley</ENAMEX>. The white almond blossoms in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">spring</TIMEX> are one of the most sublime sights in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX>.
The region‚Äôs overpowering isolation is very evident on curvy backroads, where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drivers</ENAMEX> must contend with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> straggling along the side with hoes hoisted over their shoulders, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> carrying bunches of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branches</ENAMEX>, and serious-looking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX> towing donkey-led <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">carts</ENAMEX>. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vila Real</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southwest</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vila Real</ENAMEX> is the largest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> in the region, with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30,000</NUMEX>. Mostly modern and industrial, it sits on the edge of the impressive deep gorge of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">River Corgo</ENAMEX>, a tributary of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Douro</ENAMEX>. A scenic way of reaching <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Vila Real</ENAMEX> is as a passenger on the narrow-gauge <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peso da R√©gua</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">68</NUMEX>) in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Douro Valley</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vila Real</ENAMEX> itself is somewhat less than fascinating, but it‚<ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">Äôs</ENAMEX> surrounded by several interesting sights nearby, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alv√£o</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mar√£o</ENAMEX> mountain ranges rise abruptly just outside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, making this an excellent base for hiking and climbing. 
At the center of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> is the broad <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avenida Carvalho Ara√∫jo</ENAMEX>, where you will find the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">cathedral</ENAMEX> and the tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> in an old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansion</ENAMEX>. If you continue south, you will pass <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 14th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Capela de S√£o Bras</ENAMEX> and be rewarded by a fine view of the gorge.
The top sight in the area is the magnificent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Baroque</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">manor house</ENAMEX> known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Solar de Mateus</ENAMEX>, just <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 miles</NUMEX>) from <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Vila Real</ENAMEX>. The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 18th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italianate</ENAMEX> fa√ßade is familiar to many: It appears on bottles of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mateus Ros√©</ENAMEX> (although there is no connection) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Portugal‚</ENAMEX>Äôs long-standing top export. You can take a guided tour of the interior, which has several notable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">salons</ENAMEX> and a well-stocked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX>, but the exterior and formal gardens are the standout features.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chaves</ENAMEX> and Environs
Beyond <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Vila Real</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tr√°s-os-Montes</ENAMEX> becomes noticeably wilder. The main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chaves</ENAMEX> follows a scenic route along the valley of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corgo</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vidago</ENAMEX> is an elegant <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">spa</ENAMEX> town, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">17 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">11 miles</NUMEX>) before <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chaves</ENAMEX>, boasting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Edwardian Palace Hotel</ENAMEX>, gardens, and a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX>-hole <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">golf course</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">spa</ENAMEX> is only open in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX>.
Chaves, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a mere 12 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">7 miles</NUMEX>) from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>, is a quiet place¬†‚Äî¬†at least now that it isn‚Äôt suffering repeated attacks from the invading <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX>. The last military attack took place in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1912</TIMEX>, but waves of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shoppers</ENAMEX> still invade the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> every <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekend</TIMEX> in search of bargain prices on a number of goods. The town‚Äôs strategic role as a border-crossing is reflected in its name (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chaves means ‚ÄúKeys‚Äù</ENAMEX>) and by its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two 17th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">fortresses</ENAMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Forte de S√£o Francisco</ENAMEX> has been converted into a superior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX>). There is also a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14th-century</TIMEX> keep, which <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> houses an interesting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Military Museum</ENAMEX>.
Chaves was an important <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">spa town</ENAMEX>, known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aquae Flaviae</ENAMEX>, and its hot springs (good for rheumatism and gout) remain open in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Romans</ENAMEX> also built a bridge over the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">River T√¢mega</ENAMEX>, which is still in use and retains its ancient milestone. You can learn more about the town‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> past in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Museu da Regi√£o Flaviense</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Regional Museum</ENAMEX>) on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Pra√ßa Cam√µes</ENAMEX>. The attractive, well-maintained old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> also has several interesting medieval squares and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> fine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX>.
Long before the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Romans</ENAMEX> arrived, the region‚Äôs prehistoric <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhabitants</ENAMEX> left a series of carvings on a massive granite <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">boulder</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Outeiro Machado</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 miles</NUMEX>) outside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chaves</ENAMEX>. The carved symbols are believed to have been associated with rituals involving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sacrifice¬†‚Äî¬†easy</ENAMEX> to believe in this otherworldly setting.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bragan√ßa</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northeast</ENAMEX>
The route from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chaves</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bragan√</ENAMEX>ßa is particularly attractive: the road winds over mountain passes, through pine <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">forests</ENAMEX>, and past the spines of bare, rocky hillsides. The new and partially completed <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> of returned emigrants stand out from the simple <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> strung alongside fields still worked by donkey plow.
Bragan√ßa is a remote <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">outpost</ENAMEX>, but one with a grand history. It was here that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Catherine</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bragan√ßa</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles II</ENAMEX>, was born. She took with her to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX> the custom of drinking <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX>, and control of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bombay</ENAMEX>, thus beginning England‚Äôs interest in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Catherine‚Äôs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> served as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rulers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Portugal</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1640 and 1910</TIMEX>, but they preferred their estate at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vila Vi√</ENAMEX>ßosa in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alentejo</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">95</NUMEX>) to this lonely vastness.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> is dominated by its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Citadel</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cidadela</ENAMEX>), one of the best-known in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX>, and by the bleak surrounding hills. The fortress encloses a small, medieval village of white-washed <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> still raise eyebrows. The central keep sits on the highest ground and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> an interesting <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Museu Militar</ENAMEX>, tracing the course of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> military <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concerns</ENAMEX> from prehistoric times right through to the colonial wars of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1970s</TIMEX>. In front of the keep is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Portugal‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most curious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pelourinho</ENAMEX>, which stands on top of a primitive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">granite boar</ENAMEX> (porca), carved in prehistoric times. 
Also within the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Igreja de Santa Maria</ENAMEX>, with its wavy entrance columns and a lovely painted ceiling. Next door stands a rare example of a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Meeting House</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Domus Municipalis</ENAMEX>), the only surviving <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Romanesque</ENAMEX> civic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX>. It has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sides</ENAMEX>, and the upper floor, decorated with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Romanesque</ENAMEX> arches under a timber roof, was used for assemblies, while the lower floor served as a water cistern.
In the lower <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, the unusual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museu Regional Abade de Ba√</ENAMEX>ßal is located in the former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bishop‚Äôs Palace</ENAMEX>. The abbot was quite a collector; on display are an eclectic mix of local archaeological finds, clerical items, regional paintings, and costumes. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX> worth a look are the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance Igreja de S√£o Bento</ENAMEX>, with its contrasting ceiling, part <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moorish</ENAMEX> carved <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wood</ENAMEX> and part trompe l‚Äôoeil; and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Igreja de S√£o Vicente</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pedro</ENAMEX> I claimed to have married <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">In√™s de Castro</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45</NUMEX>).
The barren and wild <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parque Natural de Montesinho</ENAMEX> lies between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bragan√ßa</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>, and is home to a number of small, isolated <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> that have striven to keep up their traditions of communal ownership and pre-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> ritual. They share this landscape with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">wolves</ENAMEX> and boars. For hardcore <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hikers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montesinho</ENAMEX> is a delight. For details of campsites, visit the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park office</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bragan√ßa.</ENAMEX> The tiny <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rio de Onor</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">24 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">15 miles</NUMEX>) to the northeast, is a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> that time forgot and a geographical oddity. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> straddles the border: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> is in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> (where <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">it‚Äôs</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rihonor de Castilla</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Locals</ENAMEX> have long gone back and forth between <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX>, with intermarriage between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> nationalities common.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miranda do Douro</ENAMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">About as far</NUMEX> east as you can get in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tr√</ENAMEX>°s-os-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Montes</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miranda do Douro</ENAMEX> stands poised at the edge of the great gorge of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alto Douro</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Upper Douro</ENAMEX>). Halfway across the modern <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dam</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> begins.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Miranda</ENAMEX> itself is officially a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúcity</ENAMEX>,‚Äù even though it has only <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 2,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhabitants</ENAMEX>. Their low white-washed <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> and cobbled <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> were long ago enclosed by walls to keep the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> out¬†‚Äî¬†a purpose that failed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1762</TIMEX>, when a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> blew up the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX>, leaving it a fairly uninspiring ruin.
The event led <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miranda</ENAMEX> to lose its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bishop</ENAMEX>, who decamped to the safety of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bragan√ßa.</ENAMEX> The cold, dark and austere <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">S√©</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cathedral</ENAMEX>) remains. In the right-hand <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">transept</ENAMEX>, in a glass case, is a curiosity, a small statue of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Menino Jesus da Cartolina</ENAMEX>. Sporting hand-tailored clothes of a tiny dandy (complete with top hat and several sets of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Baby Liberace</ENAMEX> doll clothes at the ready) the little figure commemorates a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy-hero</ENAMEX> who is said to have saved the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Locals</ENAMEX> believed he was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus</ENAMEX> in disguise.
On <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Largo Dom Jo√</ENAMEX>£o <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">III</ENAMEX>, at the center of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, is the excellent <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Museu da Terra de Miranda</ENAMEX>, displaying a selection of traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mirand√</ENAMEX>™s costumes, ancient ritualistic figures, furniture, and folklore objects. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miranda</ENAMEX> has its own culture and a distinctive dialect, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mirand√™s</ENAMEX>, that freely combines <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX>, and even some <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hebrew</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> is also renowned for its festivals and unique sword <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dancers</ENAMEX>, called the pauliteiros.
The gorge itself is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 2 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 mile</NUMEX>) away, down a twisting <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>. The rocky hillsides on both sides of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dam</ENAMEX> are home to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 80</NUMEX> species of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX>, as well as flocks of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sheep</ENAMEX>. Cruise <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> on the dammed side of the gorge take trips upriver. On the other side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dam</ENAMEX>, the river snakes its way through <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX>-wine <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> down to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Porto</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southeastern Tr√</ENAMEX>°s-os-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Montes</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mirandela</ENAMEX> is a pleasant <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">hub</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">region‚Äôs road system</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">54 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">33 miles</NUMEX>) southeast of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chaves</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">64 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">40 miles</NUMEX>) southwest of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bragan√ßa</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">70 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">43 miles</NUMEX>) northeast of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Vila Real</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> lies among orchards in the valley of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tua</ENAMEX> river. The bridge over the river is a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15th-century</TIMEX> construction, built on a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> base. The old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of cobbled <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> is dominated by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th-century</TIMEX> town hall, home of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T√</ENAMEX>°vora <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> until the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marqu√™s de Pombal</ENAMEX> had them all executed on a trumped-up charge of treason. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Modern Art Gallery</ENAMEX> is worth a visit.
Halfway between <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vila</ENAMEX> Real and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mirandela</ENAMEX> is the small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mur√ßa</ENAMEX>, most famous for its prehistoric carved stone <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pig</ENAMEX>, which can be found on a platform in the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>.
Farther south and east, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Upper Douro</ENAMEX> region, the climate is noticeably warmer. The eccentrically named <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Freixo</ENAMEX> do <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Espada-√†-Cinta (‚ÄúAsh Tree of the Belted Sword‚Äù</ENAMEX>) is where, according to legend, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 13th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Dom Dinis</ENAMEX> hung his <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">sword</ENAMEX>. He also built the town‚Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX>-sided <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> has an enviable collection of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manueline</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> and attracts hordes of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the spring</TIMEX> to see flowering almond blossoms in the local orchards. The impressive <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Igreja de Matriz</ENAMEX> (the parish <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>) was rebuilt in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1520</TIMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manueline</ENAMEX> style and has a magnificent painting attributed to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gr√£o Vasco</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">56</NUMEX>).
Alentejo
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">‚Äúland</ENAMEX> beyond the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tagus‚Äù</ENAMEX> (alem <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tejo</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Arabic</ENAMEX>) is a hot and dusty plain, sheathed in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wheat</ENAMEX>, olive and cork <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>, separating <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lisbon</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve</ENAMEX>. Though it frequently gets passed over by those hell-bent on getting to the southern beaches, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alentejo</ENAMEX> is one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Portugal‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most fascinating and historic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX>. 
Although it accounts for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately one third</NUMEX> of the country‚Äôs land area, these vast, sun-baked plains are sparsely populated. The slow-moving lifestyle has given rise to jokes about its equally slow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhabitants</ENAMEX> (such as the one about the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Alentejano</ENAMEX> who keeps an empty bottle in the fridge for his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> who don‚Äôt <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drink</ENAMEX>). In fact, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alentejo</ENAMEX> is far more sophisticated and varied than it may first appear, with an excellent wine-making tradition, large aristocratic estates, and some of the country‚Äôs historic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">√âvora</ENAMEX>. Massive medieval fortresses stand watch atop steep hills along the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> border, and ancient dolmens¬<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">†‚Äî¬†megalithic stones¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†dot the countryside. And for those who absolutely must see the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alentejo</ENAMEX> has its own costa, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Costa Azul</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Blue Coast</ENAMEX>, a lower-key version of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve</ENAMEX>.
√âvora
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">√âvora</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">150 km/93 miles</NUMEX> east of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lisbon</ENAMEX>) is the acclaimed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">star</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alentejo</ENAMEX>. Originally a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> settlement and center of learning, √âvora is now a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of splendid <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>, mostly dating from its heyday as the base of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House of Aviz</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rulers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 14th century</TIMEX> until the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Hapsburgs</ENAMEX> took over in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1581</TIMEX>). By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th century</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">√âvora</ENAMEX> had lost influence and development came to a halt, preserving the city‚Äôs distinctive <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pal√°cios</ENAMEX> for posterity.
The major sights are enclosed within <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> rings of concentric walls and tucked among √âvora‚Äôs great maze of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moorish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">alleys</ENAMEX> and squares (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">pra√ßas</ENAMEX>). The distinctive main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pra√ßa do Giraldo</ENAMEX>, is marked by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moorish</ENAMEX> arches and an attractive <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16th-century</TIMEX> fountain in its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>. The tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> is located here.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">√âvora‚Äôs Templo Romano</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roman Temple</ENAMEX>), sometimes called the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diana</ENAMEX>, dates to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 2nd</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3rd century</TIMEX> ad. Its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> Corinthian columns rise skyward from a platform that was in use <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">as recently as the 19th century</TIMEX> as a slaughterhouse.
Next to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX> is the elegant <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pousada dos L√≥ios</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">178</NUMEX>), a state-owned inn that was formerly a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">convent</ENAMEX>. Abutting the pousada is the privately owned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S√£o Jo√£o Evangelista</ENAMEX> (also known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L√≥ios</ENAMEX>, the old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> of the same <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">convent</ENAMEX>). Inside are some of the country‚Äôs finest examples of azulejo tilework, created in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 18th century</TIMEX> by the celebrated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ant√¥nio Oliveira Bernardes</ENAMEX> and depicting the life of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S√£o Louren√ßo</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Lawrence</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> holds several other surprises. Hidden beneath trapdoors on either side of the aisle are a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Moorish cistern 15 m</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> ft) deep and a collection of monks‚Äô bones in the ossuary. There are also confession holes that open onto the pousada‚Äôs cloister, from where you can spy on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diners</ENAMEX>.
The nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">S√©</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cathedral</ENAMEX>), begun in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1186</TIMEX>, betrays its crusading origins with its fortress-like <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Romanesque</ENAMEX> style. Note the statues of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Twelve Apostles</ENAMEX> by the door and their odd gargoyle <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>. The impressive eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX> was rebuilt by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Friedrich Ludwig</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Convent</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mafra</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42</NUMEX>), using the multicolored marble of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alentejo</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">cathedral</ENAMEX> has an especially beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gothic</ENAMEX> cloister and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sacred Art Museum</ENAMEX>, with an extraordinary impressive collection of relics and clerical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vestments</ENAMEX>. The upper <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">choir</ENAMEX> is exquisitely carved, with a great <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> organ dating to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1562¬†‚Äî¬†one</NUMEX> of the oldest in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Igreja de S√£o Fransisco</ENAMEX> holds <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of √âvora‚Äôs greatest (and most macabre) attractions, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Capela</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dos</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ossos</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Chapel</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bones</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">chapel</ENAMEX> is a large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">room</ENAMEX> wholly constructed with the bones of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5,000 monks</NUMEX>; skulls form the window frames and femurs cover the columns. Over the entrance is a spooky sign that reminds <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> of their own mortality: <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚ÄúN√≥s ossos que aqui estamos</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pelos</ENAMEX> vossos <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">esperamos‚Äù (‚ÄúWe bones</ENAMEX> that are here, await the arrival of yours‚Äù).
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Museu de √âvora</ENAMEX>, not far from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">cathedral</ENAMEX>, is housed in the old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">archbishop‚Äôs palace</ENAMEX>. It has an important collection of paintings by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Flemish</ENAMEX>-inspired ‚ÄúPortuguese <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">School</ENAMEX>,‚Äù the finest being a polyptych of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> panels depicting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Life</ENAMEX> of the Virgin from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 15th‚Äìlate 16th century</TIMEX>. The altarpiece was removed from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S√</ENAMEX>© in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1717</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> also contains an eclectic mix of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stone</ENAMEX> sculptures, including some <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> tombstones, several <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> votive inscriptions, and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">medieval tomb carvings</ENAMEX>.
There are several other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> of interest, as well as the old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">university</ENAMEX>, but beyond its admirable register of historical monuments, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">√âvora</ENAMEX> remains a thoroughly charming small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> to stroll and take in at a leisurely pace. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rua 5 de Outubro</ENAMEX>, a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">long</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">thoroughfare</ENAMEX> leading to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pra√ßa do Giraldo</ENAMEX>, is the main shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>. 
Rest of the Alentejo
The fine white-washed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arraiolos</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">21 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">13 miles</NUMEX>) north of √âvora, is famed for its carpet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">workshops</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">town‚Äôs handwoven wool</ENAMEX> rugs, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moorish</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Persian</ENAMEX> style, have been made here since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th century</TIMEX>. While they aren‚Äôt cheap (though cheaper here than elsewhere), they are extremely beautiful.
Another excellent day <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">trip from √âvora</ENAMEX> is to the megaliths near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Reguengos de Monsaraz</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">36 km/22 miles</NUMEX> to the southeast). These baffling prehistoric monuments, or dolmens, consist of standing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stones</ENAMEX> (menhirs) and stone circles (cromlechs) that look like spin-offs from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stonehenge</ENAMEX> (ask the tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> in √âvora for a pamphlet on these and other dolmens in the area as well as for precise directions).
Near the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> border is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monsaraz</ENAMEX>, a quietly stunning fortified <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">hilltop</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> with cobbled <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> and spectacular views over the plains. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> (now occasionally hosting bullfights) is one in the long <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> of fortifications built by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Dom Dinis</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 14th century</TIMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Marble Towns</ENAMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">About 46 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">28 miles</NUMEX>) northeast of √âvora, marble supplants more mundane building materials for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palaces</ENAMEX>, thanks to the great number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">quarries</ENAMEX> found at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Estremoz, Borba</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vila Vi√ßosa</ENAMEX>.
The largest of these quarries is near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Estremoz</ENAMEX>, a walled <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> full of gleaming white marble stretching above the plains. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rossio</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pra√ßa Marqu√™s de Pombal</ENAMEX>) forms the heart of the lower <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> and is home to the hustle and bustle of a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> market, one of the region‚Äôs liveliest, where you can buy the famous pottery of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Estremoz</ENAMEX>, tasty local <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cheese</ENAMEX>, and any of the other agricultural products of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alentejo</ENAMEX>. There is a tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>, as well as an interesting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museu Rural</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rural Museum</ENAMEX>) displaying a wealth of idiosyncratic local gadgets and pottery. Also here is the beautiful marble-faced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C√¢mara Municipal</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Town Hall</ENAMEX>), converted from an old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">convent</ENAMEX>, with impressive azulejo panels.
The upper <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> is reached through medieval walls. Lording over the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 13th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Torre das Tr√™s Coroas</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> keep, or <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Tower of Three Crowns</ENAMEX>), visible for <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">miles</NUMEX> around. Inside is the azulejo-covered <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">chapel of Rainha Santa Isabel</ENAMEX>, dedicated to the memory of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Dom Dinis‚</ENAMEX>Äôs sainted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">queen</ENAMEX>. To <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> side is the white-marble <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Palace</ENAMEX>, now one of the country‚Äôs finest and most in-demand pousadas.
Borba, on the road to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Elvas</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>, is more down-to-earth, though its marble <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> betray the source of the local wealth: The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Borba</ENAMEX> make their living from extracting marble from quarries, as well as producing fine red and white <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wines</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Every November</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> hosts a gregarious <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> festival. 
Just up the road, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4 miles</NUMEX>) away, is a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> marble <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vila Vi√ßosa</ENAMEX>. The pretty <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> is most remarkable for its impressive <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Pa√ßo Ducal</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ducal Palace</ENAMEX>) of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bragan√</ENAMEX>ßa <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, the last of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Portugal‚</ENAMEX>Äôs royal dynasties. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pa√ßo</ENAMEX> used to be the favorite country <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, who often preferred hunting in the enormous surrounding <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> to the fuss of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lisbon</ENAMEX> or the cold of their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bragan√</ENAMEX>ßa in northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">84</NUMEX>). The guided tour (in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> only) provides an intimate glimpse of the royal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartments</ENAMEX> as they would have appeared before the assassination of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carlos</ENAMEX> I in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1908</TIMEX>. Next door to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> is the pousada, in a gorgeously restored <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">convent</ENAMEX>. 
Further east, and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">nearer</NUMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>, is the mighty frontier fortress <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Elvas</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> walls¬†‚Äî¬†among the best-preserved in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Portugal¬†‚Äî¬†were</ENAMEX> modernized in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th century</TIMEX> and given the characteristic star shape that distinguishes the work of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vauban</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX>. From the ramparts are superb views of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> plains and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> across the border. Nearby is the oldest section of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, with steep cobblestoned <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> and hanging laundry. Extending from the city‚Äôs walls is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aqueduto da Amoreira</ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">aqueduct</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">some 7 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4 miles</NUMEX>) long that took <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">124 years</TIMEX> to complete. The town‚Äôs largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>, on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pra√ßa da Rep√∫blica</ENAMEX>, is the richly painted <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nossa Senhora da Assun√ß√£o</ENAMEX>, with an elaborate Manueline portal and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">belltower</ENAMEX> overlooking the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nossa Senhora dos Aflitos</ENAMEX>, another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> closer to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX>, has an octagonal shape that reflects the influence of the architecture of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Knights Templar</ENAMEX>, and the remarkable <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dome</ENAMEX> is covered in beautiful <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">azulejos</ENAMEX>. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Northeastern Alentejo</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Portalegre</ENAMEX> is the prosperous, no-nonsense capital of the northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alentejo</ENAMEX>, located near the hills and neolithic monuments of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Serra de S√£o Mamede</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">59 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">36 miles</NUMEX>) north of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Estremoz</ENAMEX>. Its past wealth, based on carpet and silk production, accounts for the graceful <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansions</ENAMEX> lining the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rua 19 de Junho</ENAMEX>. By far the most interesting sight in town, though, is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">F√°brica Real de Tape√ßarias</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tapestry Factory</ENAMEX>), housed in a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jesuit</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>, where <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozens</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> use great handlooms to weave carpets from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of different shades of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wool</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Horse</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fans</ENAMEX> should be sure to visit <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alter do Ch√£o</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">33 km/20 miles</NUMEX> southeast of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Portalegre</ENAMEX>), the location of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coudelaria de Alter Real</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Stud Farm</ENAMEX>), where <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Portugal‚Äôs finest horses</ENAMEX> are bred. If you arrive in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX> you can watch the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lusitanian</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alter do Ch√</ENAMEX>£o <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX> being fed. There is also an interesting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> has a fine restored <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fl√¥r da Rosa</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crato</ENAMEX> are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> small agricultural <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> west of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Portalegre</ENAMEX>. In the former is one of the best examples of how the state pousada <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> is adapting modern architecture to historic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>. The inn now occupying <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 14th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Convento de Fl√¥r da Rosa</ENAMEX> is extraordinary. Outside of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, on the road to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aldeia da Mata</ENAMEX>, is one of the best-preserved dolmens in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX>, a mysterious prehistoric chamber sitting unobtrusively in rolling pastoral lands. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Crato</ENAMEX> is a stately <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> with an interesting <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Varanda do Gr√</ENAMEX>£o Prior, with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stone arches</ENAMEX> under a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terrace</ENAMEX> once used for outdoor <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mass</ENAMEX>, and a municipal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> of local handicrafts and artifacts <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> doors down. Above <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> are the curious ruins of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX>, now undergoing extensive restoration. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North of Portalegre</ENAMEX> is the pleasant town <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Castelo de Vide</ENAMEX>, whose <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> is surrounded by gleaming <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> that nuzzle against the steeply sloping hill. Further down the hill, the winding alleyways of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Judiaria</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Jewish Quarter</TIMEX>) have survived and make a great place for wandering. Among these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> is the country‚Äôs oldest surviving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">synagogue</ENAMEX> (dating from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 13th century</TIMEX>). For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX> the fresh springs at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fonte de Vila</ENAMEX>, close to the handsome main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pra√ßa Dom Pedro V</ENAMEX>, have been another of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Castelo de Vide‚</ENAMEX>Äôs many attractions.
A steep winding road leads to the dramatically situated medieval walled <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">village Marv√£o</ENAMEX>. Perched on an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outcrop</ENAMEX> overlooking <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>, the easygoing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> is the highest in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX> (at <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">862 m/2,800 ft</NUMEX>). <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">The 13th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> walls appear woven right into the natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rock</ENAMEX>; the views from atop the ramparts, of both the white-washed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> and surrounding area, are stunning. It‚Äôs not hard to understand why the fortress proved virtually impenetrable. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marv√£o</ENAMEX> has almost all the charm of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">√ìbidos</NUMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43</NUMEX>), but without the slickness or tour <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bus</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowds</ENAMEX>. Just outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> entrance is a handsome <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museu Municipal</ENAMEX>, with nice archaeological finds, religious artifacts and altarpieces, and regional costumes. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baixo</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lower</ENAMEX>) Alentejo
Of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> origin (it was a regional <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> under <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Julius Caesar</ENAMEX>), the agricultural <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beja</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">78 km/48 miles</NUMEX> south of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">√âvora</NUMEX>) is at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">hub</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX> that lead to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lisbon</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve</ENAMEX>, and across the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alentejo</ENAMEX>. The old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> is particularly attractive.
The decoratively crenellated <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Torre de Menagem</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> dates to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 13th century</TIMEX> and provides a good lookout over the extensive wheatfields of the region. The city‚Äôs most interesting sight is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Convento de Nossa Senhora da Concei√ß√£o</ENAMEX>, with its fine Manueline carving, bright <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moorish</ENAMEX>-style azulejos, splendid <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Baroque chapel</ENAMEX>, and an explosion of rococo gold leaf. The former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">convent houses</ENAMEX> an interesting regional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> with a good archaeological and painting collection. There is also a unique <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Museu Visig√≥tico</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Visigothic Art Museum</ENAMEX>) in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santo Amaro, Beja‚</ENAMEX>Äôs oldest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>. The new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pousada de S√£o Fransisco</ENAMEX> has been admirably converted from another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">convent</ENAMEX>, once derelict.
The charming, sleepy <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Serpa</ENAMEX> rises neatly above the plains, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">30 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">18 miles</NUMEX>) east of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beja</ENAMEX>, on the route to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>. Beyond the formidable <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Porta da Beja</ENAMEX>, a monumental gate in the city <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wall</ENAMEX>, small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> wend among bright white <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>. Many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> hide small <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cheese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factories</ENAMEX>, which produce <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Serpa‚Äôs famous ewe‚Äôs milk cheese</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">town‚Äôs castle</ENAMEX> was partially destroyed by a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> attack in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1707</TIMEX>, but still affords enjoyable views. The walls continue past a privately owned <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansion</ENAMEX> and on to a slender <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">aqueduct</ENAMEX>, which ends in an ancient well with a working <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX>-pulley system for drawing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>. A small ethnographic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> displays the wares of the agricultural and industrial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> of the area.
From <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Serpa</ENAMEX> a rewarding drive takes you south toward the eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Algarve</ENAMEX>, through a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">hilly</NUMEX> and sparsely populated landscape where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shepherds</ENAMEX> tend their flocks. Along the way is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M√©rtola</ENAMEX>, an ancient white-washed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> founded by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phoenicians</ENAMEX>, built up by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Romans</ENAMEX>, and later seized by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moors</ENAMEX>. Perched on a ridge at the junction of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">River Guadiana</ENAMEX> and the smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oeiras</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> is protected by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moorish</ENAMEX> walls and topped by a rather dilapidated <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> with a profusion of storks‚Äô nests. 
M√©rtola bursts with history: Its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Igreja Matriz</ENAMEX>, betrays a previous incarnation as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX> with a prayer niche (mihrab), while the town hall (now a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>) is constructed on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> foundations. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Guadiana River</ENAMEX> continues as far as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve</ENAMEX>, forming part of the border with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> that follows its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX> is one of the most beautiful access routes between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alentejo</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coastal</ENAMEX> Alentejo
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alentejo coast</ENAMEX>, a popular holiday destination with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX>, has a character slightly different from that of the even more popular <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Algarve</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> here is colder, and the winds and waves greater, but it is also noticeably quieter, more relaxed, and less expensive. Often the best beaches are those near a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">river estuary</ENAMEX>, thus giving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> the choice of surfing in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX> or swimming in the calmer waters of the river.
The northernmost point of the coastal <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alentejo</ENAMEX> is the narrow, sandy peninsula of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tr√≥ia</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">46 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">28 miles</NUMEX>) northwest of the attractive <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alc√</ENAMEX>°cer do <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sal</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tr√≥ia</ENAMEX> has beaches on both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sado</ENAMEX> estuary and the ocean, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> has been heavily developed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX> to accommodate ferries from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Set√∫bal</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41</NUMEX>). Even so, it is worth visiting the remains of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cetobriga</ENAMEX>. You can escape the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowds</ENAMEX> on the beaches of the ocean side.
Further to the south and slightly inland is the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Santiago do Cac√©m</ENAMEX>, hemmed in by low-lying hills on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sides</ENAMEX> and crowned by a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">hilltop</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX>, which holds a macabre <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cemetery</ENAMEX> full of disinterred bones. Scattered about the surrounding hills is a profusion of windmill towers which, without their white canvas sails, look for all the world like ancient cannons. The lagoons of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santo Andr√©</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Melides</ENAMEX> are both easily accessible from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Santiago do Cac√</ENAMEX>©m and boast long stretches of beach, ocean, and lagoon swimming, and small beachside communities.
THE ALGARVE
To many international <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX>, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Portuguese</ENAMEX> see the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve</ENAMEX> as a distinct anomaly. The area‚Äôs distinctive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> owes much to its strong <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Moorish</ENAMEX> heritage and its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX> climate, so different from most other parts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. 
The region‚Äôs popularity with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vacationers</ENAMEX> has produced an explosion of purpose-built <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">holiday</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve</ENAMEX> is blessed with a number of spectacular beaches, a wonderfully sunny climate, many excellent sporting <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX>, and even a handful of quiet and untouristed areas.
Access from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve</ENAMEX> to another is along the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">EN125</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>, which runs most of the length of the coast. The section of coast stretching from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Faro</ENAMEX> eastwards to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>, known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sotavento Coast</ENAMEX>, is made up of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX> marshes and lagoons, with beautiful sandy beaches on the barrier islands just offshore. The most intensively developed part stretches westward from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Faro</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Portim√£o.</ENAMEX> Here the long beaches are all backed by scores of busy, large-scale tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX>.
The more dramatic <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Barlavento Coast</ENAMEX> extends west from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Portim√£o</ENAMEX>, and is characterized by a twisting shoreline indented with coves and wind-sculpted cliffs. The coast comes to an end at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cabo S√£o Vicente</ENAMEX>, known to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">medieval Portuguese</ENAMEX> as the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">End of the World</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">west</ENAMEX> coast of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve</ENAMEX> is wilder, colder, windier, and considerably emptier, even though it has its fair share of wonderful beaches. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inland</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">you‚Äôll</ENAMEX> find <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moorish</ENAMEX> monuments, numerous fruit orchards, and the scenic wooded hillsides of the serras that separate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alentejo</ENAMEX>. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barlavento Coast</ENAMEX>
The hardscrabble <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sagres</ENAMEX> and the area around it are remote, rugged, and desert-like, with only a relative smattering of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> aimed at <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX>. It is like the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Algarve‚Äôs outpost</ENAMEX>, which is precisely why it has so many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">admirers</ENAMEX>. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prince Henry the Navigator</ENAMEX> established his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navigation School</ENAMEX> here (though some protest that it was farther east, near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lagos</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> has a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">picturesque</ENAMEX> working harbor and a cute little square, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pra√ßa Rep√∫blica</ENAMEX>, and is ringed by informal (and, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX>, hopping) nightspots.
The best beaches near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sagres</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mareta, Martinhal, Beliche, Tonel</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Telheiro</ENAMEX>, are sheltered and not overcrowded. Beyond the village of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sagres</ENAMEX>, a great, rocky peninsula hangs above a brooding ocean. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sailors</ENAMEX> are said to have set up <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camp</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fortaleza de Sagres</ENAMEX> (fortress) that sits on the promontory, though little of the original structure has survived. Inside is a small <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">chapel</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nossa Senhora da Gra√ßa</ENAMEX>, and what looks to be a huge stone sun dial, known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosa dos Ventos</ENAMEX> (rose <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">compass</NUMEX>). 
A <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">couple of kilometers</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">one mile</NUMEX>) west of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sagres</ENAMEX> are the more authentic remains of another fortress, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fortaleza do Beliche</ENAMEX>. At the tip of the windswept <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">cliffs of Cabo de S√£o Vicente, the lighthouse</ENAMEX>, built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1904</TIMEX> on the site of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">convent chapel</ENAMEX>, has a beam visible <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">up to 96 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">60 miles</NUMEX>) away. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lagos</ENAMEX>, the principal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> of the western <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Algarve</ENAMEX>, is the rare beach <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> that offers something for everyone. By night <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lagos</ENAMEX> is lively, with outdoor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX> terraces and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bars</ENAMEX>, and by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX> it combines a rich historical past with a busy present. Attractive beaches are on the outskirts of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, so it is not a classic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> in the mold of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Praia da Rocha</ENAMEX>. 
The well-restored fortress, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Forte da Ponte da Bandeira</ENAMEX>, once guarded the entrance to the harbor in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th century</TIMEX>. Many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> rising towards the top of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> are narrow, cobbled, and more accustomed to donkeys than rental <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX>. Though <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lagos</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> still retains a good part of its original walls¬†‚Äî¬†most of them from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16th century</TIMEX>, but part-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> in places¬†‚Äî¬†they have been rebuilt and expanded over the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX>. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lagos</ENAMEX> was an important trading <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX> under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moors</ENAMEX>, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> enjoyed its heyday after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reconquest</ENAMEX>, when it was proclaimed the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve</ENAMEX>. On <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rua General</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alberta da Silveira</ENAMEX>, the tiny chapel <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Igreja de Santo Ant√≥nio</ENAMEX>, an exuberant gilt Baroque work and one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve‚</ENAMEX>Äôs finest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX>, was rebuilt soon after the earthquake. The entrance to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> is actually through the curious and eclectic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> next door, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Museu Regional de Lagos</ENAMEX>. Rooms display sacred art, archaeological remains, the original charter of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lagos</ENAMEX>, holy <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">vestments</ENAMEX>, and a bizarre collection of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">creatures</ENAMEX>, like a science experiment gone bad: an <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX>-legged goat <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX> preserved in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">formaldehyde</ENAMEX>, a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-eyed <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sheep</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> faces. 
The main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lagos</ENAMEX> is the charming, cobbled <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rua 25 de Abril</ENAMEX>, packed with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX>, and antiques and ceramics <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>. The beaches near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lagos</ENAMEX> range from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meia Praia</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1.6 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 mile</NUMEX>) to the east, a long (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4 km/2 miles</NUMEX>) flat stretch, to pocket-sized coves <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">just</NUMEX> west of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. Weird and wonderful rock formations, and steep cliffs that glow orange at sunset, have made them some of the most photographed in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Praia de Dona Ana</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Praia do Camilo</ENAMEX>, both small, pretty, and crowded (street signs indicate the way to each).
At the southern tip, just before the road turns west to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sagres</ENAMEX>, are the coast‚Äôs most spectacular sights. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ponta da Piedade</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Point of Piety</ENAMEX>) is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> of all stack and cliff formations along the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve</ENAMEX>, a stunning terracotta <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridges</ENAMEX>, terraces, and grottoes. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Portim√£o</ENAMEX>, second only to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Faro</ENAMEX> in size in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve</ENAMEX>, is the most workmanlike <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> on the coast. But nestled around it are some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve‚</ENAMEX>Äôs finest beaches, and that has transformed the area into one of the coast‚Äôs most popular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Praia da Rocha</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Praia Tr√™s Irm√£os</ENAMEX> in particular are lined with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> and beach-goers.
Most of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Portim√£o‚Äôs</ENAMEX> local color is down by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port</ENAMEX>, a haven of fishing activity. The top <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>-canning spot on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve, Portim√</ENAMEX>£o is renowned for its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> specializing in sardinhas grelhadas (grilled sardines). In the center of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Largo</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1¬∞ de Dezembro</ENAMEX> is a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> splendid blue-and-white azulejo benches, each illustrating a pivotal event in the history of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX>. Along <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Rua Machado</ENAMEX> dos <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Santos</ENAMEX> is the handsome <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Igreja de Nossa Senhora da Concei√ß√£o</ENAMEX>, sitting atop a small hill and incline of steps. The yellow and white <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>, originally constructed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 15th century</TIMEX>, has a beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gothic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">portico</ENAMEX> with carved <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capitals</ENAMEX>, though it looks like a colonial church you might find in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brazil</ENAMEX>, due to its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reconstruction</ENAMEX> and remodeling in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 18th and 19th centuries</TIMEX>. 
From the center of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> to the waterfront, especially if it‚Äôs anywhere near time for lunch or dinner. You can almost follow your nose toward the heady aroma of grilled sardines. It will take you to the dockside, lined with simple <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> after the other, all serving an abundance of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">delicious</ENAMEX>, smoky sardines (and other fresh-caught <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>). 
Just <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 miles</NUMEX>) down river from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Portim√</ENAMEX>£o is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Praia da Rocha</ENAMEX>, which became a holiday <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> for wealthy <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> back at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the 19th century</TIMEX>. It was ‚Äúdiscovered‚Äù by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1930s</TIMEX>, when this ‚Äúbeach of rocks,‚Äù strewn with <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">extravagantly</ENAMEX> shaped eroded stacks, provided an inspirational refuge for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intellectuals</ENAMEX>. The <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">long, 2-km</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1-mile</NUMEX>) golden beach remains the main attraction. At the very eastern end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX>, guarding the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">River Arade</ENAMEX>, is the historic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fortaleza de Santa Catarina de Ribamar</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Catherine‚Äôs Fortress</ENAMEX>), built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1621</TIMEX> to defend <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Silves</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Portim√£o</ENAMEX> against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moors</ENAMEX>. 
The opposite end of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Praia da Rocha‚</ENAMEX>Äôs long stretch is known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Praia do Vau</ENAMEX>. The splendid rock formations and coves continue, but this end of the beach is quieter and less developed than the eastern end.
Just west, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Praia de Tr√™s Irm√</ENAMEX>£os is the slightly upscale beach <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cousin</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Praia da Rocha</ENAMEX>. The eastern end of the beach is a beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cove</ENAMEX>, hemmed in by cliffs and ochre rocks. Beyond it, the beach stretches to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alvor</ENAMEX>, a classic Algarvian fishermen‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX>. Narrow cobbled <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> plunge downhill to a quay and market where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boats bob</ENAMEX> at anchor on a wide, marshy lagoon. At the top of the hill, on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rua da Igreja</ENAMEX>, is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Igreja Matriz</ENAMEX>, a charming <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>, with a delicately carved <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manueline</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">portico</ENAMEX>, perhaps the finest on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve</ENAMEX>. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North of Portim√£o</ENAMEX>, and extending across the western <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX>, is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Serra de Monchique</ENAMEX>, a mountain range that protects the coast from the hot plains farther north. The serra is a verdant landscape of cork, pine, and chestnut <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>, and low-lying areas are covered in blankets of colorful wildflowers. 
The first stop on the scenic journey along <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">route 266</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">spa</ENAMEX> village of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caldas de Monchique</ENAMEX>, known since <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> times for its therapeutic waters. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North of Caldas</ENAMEX>, the road weaves uphill quickly, rising <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">300 m</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,000 ft</NUMEX>) in <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 miles</NUMEX>) past terraced <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">farmlands</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">forests</ENAMEX> of eucalyptus, <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">oak</ENAMEX>, and cork. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monchique</ENAMEX> is a small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">market town</ENAMEX>, known for its handicrafts and the famous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Manueline</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">portico</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">its 16th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Igreja Matriz</ENAMEX>. 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> continues upwards, towards <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">F√≥ia</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost 915</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3,000 ft</NUMEX>) above sea level, affording one of the best views in southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX>. On a clear day you can see from the bay of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Portim√</ENAMEX>£o to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Sagres</ENAMEX> peninsula, and pick out the rocky outcrops of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lagos</ENAMEX> beaches.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Silves</ENAMEX> is the former <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Moorish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve</ENAMEX>. More than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eight centuries ago</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Silves</ENAMEX> (then known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chelb</ENAMEX>) was one of the strongest outposts in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iberia</ENAMEX>, a magnificent <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palaces</ENAMEX>, gardens, bazaars, and a huge red <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> on a hill. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Silves</ENAMEX> is now just a dusty backwater, but the glorious setting remains. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Castelo</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dos</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mouros</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moors‚Äô Castle</ENAMEX>) took shape after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reconquest</ENAMEX>, though it preserves distinctly <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Moorish</ENAMEX> lines. Next to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> is the impressive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gothic S√© Velha</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Old Cathedral</ENAMEX>) of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Silves</ENAMEX>, built by the liberating <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crusaders</ENAMEX>. Opposite the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S√</ENAMEX>© is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Igreja da Miseric√≥rdia</ENAMEX>, with a classic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manueline</ENAMEX>-style side door. The imposing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Torre√£o da Porta da Cidade</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Turret of the City Gate</ENAMEX>) gives you a good idea of how seriously defense of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> was taken. 
The charming <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carvoeiro</ENAMEX>, an archetypal small <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Barlavento</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX>, has a tiny beach at the bottom of a pretty valley. The original village of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carvoeiro</ENAMEX> is now fairly commercialized, but to many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> it remains one of the coast‚Äôs most attractive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inland</ENAMEX>, just off the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>, is the attractive little village of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Porches</ENAMEX>, with some classic, white <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Algarvian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> and filigreed chimneys. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Porches</ENAMEX> is famous throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Port</ENAMEX>-ugal for its hand-painted pottery, though you won‚Äôt find much in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> itself. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> of greatest renown are along the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">EN 125</ENAMEX> route. 
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the most photographed beaches along this stretch is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nossa Senhora da Rocha</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Our Lady of the Rock</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rock</ENAMEX> in question is a promontory, boldly jutting out into the sea, surmounted by a little white fishermen‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>. 
The beach of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Arma√ß√£o de P√</ENAMEX>™ra is one of the longest in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Algarve¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†a flat, golden stretch to the east, picturesque rock stacks and small coves to the west. The massive development on the east end of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, though, has pretty much run roughshod over the natural beauty of the area, all but eclipsing the former fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX>.
Albufeira, at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time a picturesque fishermen‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, has grown wildly in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX> to become the leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve</ENAMEX>. Its cliff-top position and labyrinthine <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> plan provided an easily defensible spot for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moors</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Albufeira</ENAMEX> proved one of the last <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> to fall during the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reconquest</ENAMEX>. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Modern Albufeira</ENAMEX> has fallen prey to mass tourism¬<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">†‚Äî¬†bars</ENAMEX>, caf√©s, and nightspots pump out music day and night. The excellent beaches west of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> are relatively uncrowded. The best are <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">S√£o Rafael</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coelha, Castelo</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gal√©</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> small, beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coves</ENAMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the most picturesque <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX> is the lovely village <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alte</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 30 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">18 miles</NUMEX>) north of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Albufeira</ENAMEX>. The architectural highlight of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> is the beautiful <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Igreja Matriz</ENAMEX>, entered through a classic Manueline portal. The rest of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alte</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve</ENAMEX> of picture postcards¬†‚Äî¬†white-washed <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> along narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>, colorful windows, filigreed chimney pots, and red-tiled roofs. 
Loosely grouped with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Albufeira</ENAMEX> are beaches to the east. Here, the coastline features the last of the dramatic rock formations that have made the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve</ENAMEX> so famous. Fal√©sia is a beautiful beach framed by high cliffs, but to get to it you need to negotiate the grounds of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sheraton Algarve</ENAMEX>, whose elevator down to the beach is for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guests</ENAMEX> only. There are more excellent beaches at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santa Eulalia, Balaia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Praia da Oura</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S√£o Jo√£o.</ENAMEX> The center of activity along this beach <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hinterland</ENAMEX> is the infamous <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚Äústrip‚Äù¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">long</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> of bustling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, and nightspots leading up to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">hilltop area</ENAMEX> known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montechoro</ENAMEX>. 
Nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vilamoura</ENAMEX> is a wholly planned and sanitized tourist undertaking with high-rise <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> and sprawling villas that line manicured <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">golf courses</ENAMEX> to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">19th</NUMEX>-hole <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">club bar</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve‚</ENAMEX>Äôs biggest marina. It‚Äôs a major draw for those who have their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clubs</ENAMEX> ready for a golfing vacation; several of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve‚</ENAMEX>Äôs best courses have been sculpted out of the area. 
A little farther west, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Quarteira</ENAMEX>, once a quiet fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX>, is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> virtually unrecognizable, subsumed under an onslaught of rows and rows of apartment <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">East of Vilamoura</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quarteira</ENAMEX>, the terrain begins to change. The rugged, rocky lines of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Barlavento</ENAMEX> coast west of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Faro</ENAMEX> give way to long flat beaches of the east. 
The small crossroads <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Almancil</ENAMEX> has <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, caf√©s, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX>, many of which are dedicated to serving <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expatriates</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">A few miles</NUMEX> south on the coast are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most luxurious and exclusive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vale do Lobo</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quinta do Lago</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vale do Lobo</ENAMEX> is a maze-like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">villa community</ENAMEX> with a nice beach and a variety of <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">golf</ENAMEX> and tennis resort <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quinta do Lago</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a few miles</NUMEX> down the coast, has one of the finest golf <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve</ENAMEX>, designed delicately along the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Ria Formosa Nature Preserve</ENAMEX>. The beach can be reached across a long, nostalgic wooden <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX> that crosses over wetlands and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bird sanctuaries</ENAMEX>. 
Back toward <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Almancil</ENAMEX> is one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve‚</ENAMEX>Äôs top attractions. <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">About 16 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 miles</NUMEX>) west of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Faro</ENAMEX>, a simple white <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> stands out on a small hill overlooking the thundering <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">highway</ENAMEX>. A sign simply says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúS</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Louren√ßo‚Äù¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†indicating the turn-off to <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">S√£o Louren√</ENAMEX>ßo do <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matto</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Church of St. Lawrence of the Woods</ENAMEX>). Inside is one of the most extraordinary displays of azulejo design you‚Äôll ever see. Every <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">square inch</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baroque</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">church¬†‚Äî¬†its</ENAMEX> walls, vaulted ceiling, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cupola¬†‚Äî¬†is</ENAMEX> covered with hand-painted, blue-and-white ceramic tiles. Most date from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 18th century</TIMEX> and depict biblical scenes detailing the life of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Lawrence</ENAMEX>. The ensemble is a stunning sight, not to be missed.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Loul√©</ENAMEX>, north of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Almancil</ENAMEX>, is a prosperous <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> known for its leather, lace, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">copper</ENAMEX> goods. Tour <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> come from far and wide to shop at the colorful, bustling market. Just below the permanent market <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">halls</ENAMEX> on the main <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pra√ßa da Rep√∫blica</ENAMEX>, you‚Äôll find a well-preserved section of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">medieval castle</ENAMEX> walls (which were much damaged by the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">1755 earthquake</ENAMEX>). Also worth visiting are the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Igreja Matriz</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S√£o Clemente</ENAMEX>), a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Gothic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th-century</TIMEX> azulejo tiles; the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Convento da Gra√ßa</ENAMEX>, with a terrific <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Manueline</ENAMEX> portal; and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ermida de Nossa Senhora da Concei√ß√£o</ENAMEX>, a small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> prized for its Baroque altar and ceramic tiles. 
In the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> directly below the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> walls, you may well hear the sounds of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">craftsmen</ENAMEX> beating <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">copper¬†‚Äî¬†from</ENAMEX> whom you can buy direct. If you are in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve</ENAMEX> in springtime, don‚Äôt miss the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Loul√© Carnival</ENAMEX>. The parades, ‚ÄúBattle of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Flowers</ENAMEX>,‚Äù and musical celebrations are the best of their kind in the region.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S√£o Br√°s de Alportel</ENAMEX> is another <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">market town</ENAMEX> and site of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> government pousadas (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">inns</ENAMEX>) along the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve</ENAMEX>, in the midst of rolling orchards of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fig</ENAMEX>, olive, and orange <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>. You may wish to pay a visit to the charming <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Museu Etnogr√</ENAMEX>°fico do <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trajo Alg√°rvio</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum of Algarvian Costumes</ENAMEX>), where exhibits of local dress are well staged in a large, old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">90 m</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">100 yds</NUMEX>) or so off the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>.
On the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> toward <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Faro</ENAMEX> is a pair of historical sights. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pal√°cio de Est√≥i</ENAMEX> is a most curious find. The charming <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rococo</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX>, found through a small side gate just to the left of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> steps in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town center</ENAMEX>, once belonged to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dukes of Est√≥i</ENAMEX>. Begun in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-18th century</TIMEX>, it‚Äôs now abandoned and visibly dilapidated, and only the gardens are open to the public. Yet it is a spectacular sight. Its faded glory includes balustrade terraces and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">staircases</ENAMEX> with splendid bursts of bougainvillea, busts of historic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> impaled on the parapets, brightly colored wall tiles, and formal gardens. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> aims to construct a pousada (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inn</ENAMEX>) here. 
The dusty <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Villa Romana de Milreu</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> ruins of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Milreu</ENAMEX>) are <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1.5 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 mile</NUMEX>) down the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> toward <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Faro</ENAMEX> (a small sign on the side of the road reads <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚ÄúRuinas de Milreu‚Äù</ENAMEX>). The tall, semi-circular tower ruin is thought to have been a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> to pagan <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water gods</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time; however, by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fifth century</TIMEX> it had clearly been converted to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>.
Faro, the provincial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve</ENAMEX>, is bypassed by many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX>, though the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> has a greater wealth of cultural and historic monuments than any other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Algarvian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> and a picturesque old <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">quarter</TIMEX>.
The main entrance to the circular old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, near the harbor, is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arco da Vila</ENAMEX>, a charming arch and bell <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX>. Beyond the arch, a cobbled <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>, worn slick by centuries of tramping feet, leads up to the splendid expanse of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Largo da S√©</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Cathedral Square</ENAMEX>)‚Äîbest seen in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the evening</TIMEX> when floodlit and free of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX>. 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">S√©‚Äôs unusual cathedral</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX>, main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">portico</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">interior chapels</ENAMEX> are all that remain of the original <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Gothic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>. Inside is one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most important collections of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17th- and 18th-century</TIMEX> sacred art. Climb the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> for fine views over the whole of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Faro</ENAMEX>. 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Convento de Nossa Senhora da Assun√ß√£o</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Convent of Our Lady of the Assumption</ENAMEX>), the first <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve</ENAMEX>, contains what is arguably the most beautiful cloister in southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">convent</ENAMEX> has been beautifully restored as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> devoted to archaeology, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Museu Arqueol√≥gico Infante Dom Henrique</ENAMEX>. The principal exhibit is a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2,000-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> floor <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">mosaic</TIMEX> measuring <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> ft) long and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3 m</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> ft) wide. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central Faro‚</ENAMEX>Äôs main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">thoroughfare</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rua de Santo Ant√≥nio</ENAMEX>. At its far end is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museu Etnogr√°fico</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ethnographic Museum</ENAMEX>), with displays of local handicrafts and reconstructions of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> in a typical Algarvian <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> sits on the edge of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Faro‚Äôs Mouraria</ENAMEX>, or old Moorish <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">quarter</TIMEX>. The new <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, an expansion dating from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th century</TIMEX>, is west of here. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Igreja de S√£o</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pedro</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Church</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">St. Peter</ENAMEX>), built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16th century</TIMEX>, has a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">carved Baroque retable</ENAMEX> and a couple of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rococo</ENAMEX> chapels.
But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Faro‚</ENAMEX>Äôs finest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Igreja do Carmo</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Carmelite</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Church</ENAMEX>). The promise of its twin <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">belltowers</ENAMEX> and stately fa√ßade is matched by a beautiful gilded interior, but the greatest attraction is the macabre <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Capela dos Ossos</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Chapel</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bones</ENAMEX>). <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">This 19th-century</TIMEX> curiosity, like a similar chapel in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of √âvora farther north, is constructed of the skulls and bones of monks, unearthed from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">friars‚Äô cemetery</ENAMEX>. Depending on your tolerance for such things, it is either fascinating or sick beyond belief.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sotavento Coast</ENAMEX>
Heading east from the provincial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Faro</ENAMEX>, the first settlement of any size you will come to is the colorful fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Olh√£o.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Olh√£o</ENAMEX> used to be described as the ‚Äúlittle white <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cubist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve</ENAMEX>,‚Äù its architecture likened to that of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">North African</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX>. The parish <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> (which also goes by the name of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nossa Senhora do Ros√°rio</ENAMEX>) was founded by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">King Dom Pedro II</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1698</TIMEX>. The small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chapel</ENAMEX> at the rear, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nossa Senhora</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dos</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aflitos</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Our Lady of the Afflicted</ENAMEX>), is where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> often pray when their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fishermen husbands</ENAMEX> are away at sea.
Instead of the red-tiled roofs and filigreed chimneys seen elsewhere in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Olh√</ENAMEX>£o skyline comprises flat-topped roofs of terraces called <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">a√ßoeitas</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Olh√£o fish</ENAMEX> market is one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve‚</ENAMEX>Äôs best, especially famous for its mussels and other shellfish. 
With its triumverate of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moorish, Reconquista</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> roots clearly visible, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tavira</ENAMEX>, one of the true gems of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve</ENAMEX>, is one of the region‚Äôs most historically rich <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1500s</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tavira</ENAMEX> had the largest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve</ENAMEX>. This tuna-fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port</ENAMEX> with its self-assured <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of historic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX>, imposing classical-style <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansions</ENAMEX>, and beautiful riverfront gardens probably dates back ar least as far as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phoenicians</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carthaginians</ENAMEX>. In fact, its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX>-arched stone <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> origin is still in use. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tavira‚Äôs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX>, in the center of the casco hist√≥rico (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">old quarter</TIMEX>), was a defensive <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> built by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moors</ENAMEX>. The walls look directly onto the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Igreja de Santa Maria do Castelo</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Church of St. Mary of the Castle</ENAMEX>), most likely built on the site of the old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gothic</ENAMEX> portal is the only original <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13th-century</TIMEX> element of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> to have survived the devastating <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1755</TIMEX> earthquake. Across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>, the ochre-colored former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">convent</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Convento da Gra√ßa</ENAMEX>, is being converted into a pousada (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inn</ENAMEX>) by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>.
Just down the hill, off <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Rua Galeria</ENAMEX> near the river, is the beautiful <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Igreja da Miseric√≥rdia</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Church of Mercy</ENAMEX>), a spectacular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> edifice with a carved <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">portico</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rua da Liberdade</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tavira‚</ENAMEX>Äôs main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>, is lined with stately <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansions</ENAMEX>. 
A nice excursion from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tavira</ENAMEX> is to the nearby island <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ilha de Tavira</ENAMEX>, where there is a huge and thoroughly appealing beach backed by sand dunes. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jetties</ENAMEX> leave from a point, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quatro √Åguas</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a couple of kilometers</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">one mile</NUMEX>) east of town.
Back on the mainland, a turn-off of the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> east (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">EN-125</ENAMEX>, still!) of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tavira</ENAMEX> leads a small number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cacela Velha</ENAMEX>, a perfectly enchanting little white-washed village overlooking the sea. It has an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>, a telephone <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">booth</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cemetery</ENAMEX>, an old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">well</ENAMEX>, and a handful of well-tended, blue-and-white houses festooned with <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">East</ENAMEX> of here lie the high-rise canyons of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Monte Gordo</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">raison d‚Äô√™tre</ENAMEX> of all the development is a long but not especially attractive sandy beach, which stretches undisturbed for some <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6 miles</NUMEX>). 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Guadiana River</ENAMEX>, which runs into the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 miles</NUMEX>) east of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Monte Gordo</ENAMEX>, served as a natural frontier for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 2,000</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, forming the boundary between the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">provinces</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lusitania</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baetica</ENAMEX> (southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>). This geographical context explains the strategic importance of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Castro Marim</ENAMEX>, a fortress <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> occupied by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moors</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five centuries</TIMEX>. 
A little to the south, the sleepy but quietly dignified <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vila Real de Santo Ant√≥nio</ENAMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Town of St. Anthony</ENAMEX>) is the last of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Algarve‚Äôs</ENAMEX> beach <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> before <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> was built from scratch in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">just five months</TIMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1774</TIMEX>, aping the grid layout of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lisbon‚Äôs Baixa</ENAMEX> (lower <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">city</ENAMEX>). The town <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pra√ßa do Marqu√™s do Pombal</ENAMEX>, is the tour de force of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Vila Real</ENAMEX>, with black-and-white <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pavement radiating</ENAMEX> from an obelisk in the center of the square like rays from the sun. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vila Real de Santo Ant√≥nio‚</ENAMEX>Äôs main appeal is the ferry to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ayamonte</ENAMEX> across the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">The trip</ENAMEX> takes <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">just 20 minutes¬</TIMEX>†‚Äî¬†less time than it would take to drive to and over the new bridge¬†‚Äî¬†and the white <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ayamonte</ENAMEX> is a fine sight as you approach it from the river. Crossing into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>, you will need to take your passport.
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">North</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sagres</ENAMEX>, along the west coast, is the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve</ENAMEX> that may well escape intensive development, simply because, although the beaches are pleasant and the coastline dramatic, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> is colder and the wind stronger. For those interested in surfing or solitude, this coast may be ideal. Aljezur‚Äôs ruined <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moorish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> looks over the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, which makes a good base for neighboring beaches, such as the enormous rocky cove at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arrifana</ENAMEX> and the wider dune beach of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Monte Clerigo</ENAMEX>, both of which also have their own small tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX>. Further north, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Odeceixe</ENAMEX> is a pretty village set in a small river valley, which continues down to a wide cliff-backed beach at the estuary.
