Where to Go
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Puerto</ENAMEX> Vallarta
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Puerto Vallarta‚</ENAMEX>Äôs mix of small-town charm and sophisticated services seems to captivate its <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">visitors¬†‚Äî¬†it</ENAMEX> has the highest rate of return <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> of any beach <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>. It‚Äôs easy to understand why: The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> itself has a picture-postcard <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">appeal¬†‚Äî¬†whitewashed houses</ENAMEX> with red-tile roofs and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">balconies</ENAMEX> filled with <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> sit along neat rows of cobblestone streets¬†‚Äî¬†and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> here are renown for their gentle friendliness and understated hospitality. Essentially, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Vallarta</ENAMEX> is a place where it‚Äôs easy to feel both relaxed and welcome.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX> there has been a significant shift away from the traditional attractions of sunny beaches and generous margaritas to an outstanding array of ecologically sensitive excursions and soft adventures. With the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sierra Madre</ENAMEX> mountains dominating the eastern horizon, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vallarta</ENAMEX> sits at the center of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">26 miles</NUMEX> of beaches that border <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Banderas Bay</ENAMEX>, giving it a natural appeal. The varied geography attracts <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hikers</ENAMEX>, mountain <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bikers</ENAMEX>, sea kayakers, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">whale</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">watchers</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">divers</ENAMEX>.
The cultural scene has blossomed as well, with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Vallarta¬†‚Äî¬†as</ENAMEX> it is called by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">locals¬†‚Äî¬†now</ENAMEX> considered among the country‚Äôs leading art <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX>. Especially during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the winter months</TIMEX>, an almost constant succession of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">gallery</ENAMEX> openings and exhibitions attracts creative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">talent</ENAMEX> from throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Americas</ENAMEX>. The culinary <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX> has taken numerous awards and accolades back to this seaside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, where <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 250</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> offer gourmands their own piece of paradise. Yet what makes this place overwhelmingly attractive is its total lack of pretense and completely comfortable <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ambiance¬†‚Äî¬†it</ENAMEX> remains down-to-earth, genuinely casual, and simply irresistible.
Though some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">travelers</ENAMEX> have expressed concern that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vallarta</ENAMEX> has grown too much in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX>, the town‚Äôs geography has imposed clear boundaries, allowing development to gradually expand to the north and south of the central downtown area. Within the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> itself, the city <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> has strict guidelines that ensure the architectural integrity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vallarta</ENAMEX>, and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX> has implemented a successful campaign to maintain the cleanliness of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>.
The expansion in services has been welcome. Along with the exceptional range of dining options and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">galleries</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vallarta</ENAMEX> has a bounty of new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> and services, with a sizzling nightlife accented by an excellent live music scene. Taxis are plentiful and inexpensive, as are public <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">buses</ENAMEX>, making it easy to explore this paradise.
Neighborhoods 
Yes, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Vallarta</ENAMEX> is still small enough to charm. It neatly divides itself into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> key areas. Knowing the particulars of each area, helps you select a place to stay that best fits your preferences.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nuevo Vallarta</ENAMEX> is found to the north of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto</ENAMEX> Vallarta international <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX>, and is actually located in a different <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nayarit</ENAMEX>. A planned <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX>, it has evolved into a sister destination of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Vallarta</ENAMEX>, with ultra-modern <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX>, many of them all-inclusive, dominating the wide, beautiful, stretch of beach. This <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">area</ENAMEX> has a secluded sense of privacy; however, to date, it offers little in the way of dining, shopping, or nightlife outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX>. A new festival shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>, slated to open in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer of 2000</TIMEX>, should increase these options, and transportation into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Vallarta¬</ENAMEX>†‚Äî¬†about <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 minutes</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">taxi¬†‚Äî¬†is</ENAMEX> readily available. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nuevo Vallarta</ENAMEX> is also the place to kayak a lagoon or swim with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dolphins</ENAMEX>.
Located <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">just</NUMEX> north of downtown, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marina Vallarta</ENAMEX> is the site of modern <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> and wide beaches. It is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> within a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX>, with a championship <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">golf course</ENAMEX>, ample tennis <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX>, and an exclusive marina filled with yachts, sailing vessels, and charter <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX>. Surrounding the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">marina</ENAMEX> are numerous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boutiques</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, and travel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>, plus all types of services to accommodate arriving <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cruisers</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Condominiums</ENAMEX>, many available for vacation rental, surround the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">marina</ENAMEX> as well. This fashionable neighborhood is a favorite with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>, and offers the best array of activities and entertainment for the younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traveler¬</ENAMEX>†‚Äî¬†including a water <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> and mammoth video arcade and entertainment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">center</ENAMEX>. Since this development sits on a swampy area that has been filled in, the beaches in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Marina Vallarta</ENAMEX> are less attractive than those in other areas of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, and are occasionally very rocky. The grand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> make up for this with their dazzling pools, but anyone whose heart is set on true ‚Äúbeach time‚Äù should consider another option.
Vallarta‚Äôs original <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> were constructed along the stretch of wide, soft sandy strand that extends from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX> into the central downtown area. Along the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hotel Zone</ENAMEX>, there‚Äôs an ample mix of excellent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX>, and this area is also a great place for recreational <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">watersports</ENAMEX> and convenient to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vallarta‚</ENAMEX>Äôs many treasures. This is also the section of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Terminal Mar√≠tima</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marine Terminal</ENAMEX>) is located, docking point for cruise <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX> as well as the numerous excursion <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Centro</ENAMEX>, the historic downtown area, is known for its traditional white <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>, cobblestone <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>, and the malec√≥n, the broad seaside <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">walkway</ENAMEX> bordered by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vallarta‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most populated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bars</ENAMEX>, and the centerpiece of local life and many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitor</ENAMEX> photos. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> evenings in particular¬†‚Äî¬†the traditional <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</TIMEX> for a family <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">stroll¬†‚Äî¬†are</ENAMEX> perfect for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> watching. All along the malec√≥n, public sculptures are dotted, many backed by local legends or lore. The recently installed grouping of sea fantasy sculptures by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">master</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alejandro Colunga</ENAMEX> regularly attracts a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">crowd¬†‚Äî¬†sitting</ENAMEX> on, climbing over, or simply gazing upon these whimsical works of art. This is home for most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">galleries</ENAMEX>. Also known as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Viejo Vallarta</ENAMEX> it is comprised of the signature cobblestone village extending to the north and south of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cuale River</ENAMEX>, and it exemplifies <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> at its traditional best.
The best known image of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Vallarta</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iglesia de Guadalupe</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guadalupe Church</ENAMEX>), dedicated to the Virgin of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guadalupe</ENAMEX>, and topped by a copy of the crown worn by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Empress Carlota</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1860s</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Wife</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Emperor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maximillian</ENAMEX>, the only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emperor</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> to be appointed by a foreign power, she is considered to be a tragic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heroine</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golden angels</ENAMEX> hold up the bell <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX>, and the interior is decorated with a few muted murals. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> overlooks <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Vallarta‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plaza</ENAMEX> with its central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bandstand</ENAMEX> and adjacent <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palacio Municipal</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">City Hall</ENAMEX>). This <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plaza</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> of plazas throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>; what reminds you that you are in an international tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> are the surrounding signs for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Burger King</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Subway</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hooters</ENAMEX>.
Just beyond the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plaza</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cuale River</ENAMEX>, and in its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">shady retreat¬†‚Äî¬†an</ENAMEX> island, found between the two traffic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridges</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Birds twitter</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> read the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX> over a cup of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX>, and a little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> plays with an iguana outside a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop</ENAMEX> that sells the same reptiles stuffed. At the western end of the island, the small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Museo R√≠o Cuale</ENAMEX> features archeological artifacts found in the region. Adjoining the upper <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX>, the municipal mercado (market) has a range of handicrafts for sale, with traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX> sold on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX>.
Overlooking the river, and set back behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>, is the neighborhood known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gringo Gulch</ENAMEX>, site of the famed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Burton-Taylor</ENAMEX> homes. A pink-hued replica of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Bridge of Sighs connects</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these two villas</TIMEX>. Depending on the prevalent mood of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">caretaker</ENAMEX>, you may be able to view the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">interior¬†‚Äî¬†eerily</ENAMEX> preserved in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">manner¬†‚Äî¬†by forking</ENAMEX> over <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">US$5</NUMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South of El Centro</ENAMEX>, yet still considered to be a part of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Viejo Vallarta</ENAMEX>, is the area alternately known as <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚ÄúLos Muertos‚Äù</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚ÄúZona Rom√°ntica</ENAMEX>.‚Äù The neighborhood is named for the main beach in town, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Muertos</ENAMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dead)¬†‚Äî¬†however</ENAMEX>, the city <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fathers</ENAMEX> prefer a kinder, gentler nomenclature, and have unsuccessfully tried to rename it <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚ÄúZona Rom√</ENAMEX>°ntica,‚Äù and the beach, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">‚ÄúPlaya del Sol‚Äù</ENAMEX> (just so you‚Äôll know when you see the many <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> signs). From family-run beachfront <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> to eclectic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">inns</ENAMEX> poised on the surrounding hills, here is where you feel the essence of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Vallarta‚Äôs charms¬†‚Äî¬†the</ENAMEX> area preferred by independent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">travelers</ENAMEX> and repeat <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>. New <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sidewalk caf√©s</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bookstores</ENAMEX>, and martini <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX> have popped up along the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Olas Altas</ENAMEX>, giving it a decidedly bohemian, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">funky</ENAMEX> feel. This part of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> also is home to <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚ÄúRestaurant Row‚Äù</ENAMEX> (along <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Basilio Badillo</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockin‚</ENAMEX>Äô Row (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ignacio L. Vallarta</ENAMEX>, just beyond the southbound <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX>). This perpendicular meeting of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> contains something for every taste and budget, in both dining and nightlife.
Immediately south of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Viejo Vallarta</ENAMEX> is the fashionable residential neighborhood of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conchas Chinas</ENAMEX>, with numerous villas for rent, and a few <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> set into the cliffside. Extending from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conchas Chinas</ENAMEX> along the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Shore</ENAMEX>, the landscape changes to dramatic mountains that tumble toward the sea. Tucked into the private coves of this coast, you‚Äôll find a collection of full-service <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> made to order for honeymoons and romantic escapes. At the end of this stretch of shore, you‚Äôll come to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mismaloya Bay</ENAMEX>, where you can still climb up the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">ridge</ENAMEX> to the ruins of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">set</ENAMEX> built for the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Night of the Iguana</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Day Trips</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto</ENAMEX> Vallarta 
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yelapa</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern Beaches</ENAMEX>
A <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> ride away from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vallarta, Yelapa</ENAMEX> offers a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robinson Crusoe‚</ENAMEX>Äìstyle getaway for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX> trips or overnight stays. No electricity and no <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX> keep it a secluded, funky beach community, populated in part by ex-pats and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX>. The other south shore beaches are <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Las Animas</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quimixto</ENAMEX>, appropriate for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX> trips only. These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> offer palapa beach dining, and as tropical a setting as you can dream up. <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Las Animas</ENAMEX> has the better beach for swimming and sunning, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quimixto</ENAMEX> has a beautiful waterfall that you can reach by walking <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 30 minutes</TIMEX> inland along a well-marked trail. The coves surrounding <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quimixto</ENAMEX> are also noted by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">divers</ENAMEX> and snorkelers for their excellent underwater vistas. These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> beaches may all be reached by excursion <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX>, or for longer, less structured stays, take the water <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">taxi</ENAMEX> from either the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rosita</ENAMEX> (malec√≥n) , or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Muertos</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pier</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern Beaches</ENAMEX> and Towns 
Further north beyond <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nuevo Vallarta</ENAMEX> are a succession of small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> and relatively undeveloped beaches, in easy reach by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>. Just <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a few kilometers</NUMEX> to the east, traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> farming life goes its unhurried way up steep mountain <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX> where views can be superb and well worth the extra drive. The simple and the sensational seem to coexist so easily here.
Bucer√≠as is a breezy beach community known for its fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oysters</ENAMEX> and the palapa <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> on its wide, white-sand beach. Independent small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> and rental <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> provide overnight accommodations.
At the very northern top of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Banderas Bay</ENAMEX>, where the bay, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific Ocean</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sea of Cortez</ENAMEX> meet, lies <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Punta Mita</ENAMEX>. Long known as a place of high spiritual energy, this is now the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">home</ENAMEX> of a new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Four Seasons Resort</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Nicklaus</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">golf course</ENAMEX>, with more high-end development planned. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sayulita</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> intriguing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> located north of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Banderas Bay</ENAMEX>, on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific Ocean</ENAMEX>. These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> beach <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> offer quiet, rustic alternatives to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Vallarta</ENAMEX>. Both offer limited, mostly casual beach dining, and are popular with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">surfers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">backpackers</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mountain Villages</ENAMEX>
Throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th century</TIMEX>, the picturesque mountain village of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Sebasti√°n</ENAMEX> was one of the most populated <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>, renown for its mining activity. Now, it resembles a quiet ghost <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, locked in time. Limited overnight accommodations are available. Notable is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hacienda Jalisco</ENAMEX>, the old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> of mining activity, and now an inn run by ex-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pat Bud Acord</ENAMEX>. He has welcomed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Huston</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Burton</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elizabeth Taylor</ENAMEX> among his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guests</ENAMEX>.
Another mountain <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> located in the high <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sierra</ENAMEX>, east of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Vallarta</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Talpa</ENAMEX>. Accessible by a short flight or a long and winding mountain <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>, this traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> is known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">home</ENAMEX> of the Virgin of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Talpa</ENAMEX>, one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mexico‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most noted religious icons, and a popular pilgrimage destination.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Costa Alegre</ENAMEX> and Manzanillo
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Costa</ENAMEX> Alegre 
The coastal area between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Vallarta</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Manzanillo</ENAMEX>, with its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of coves and pristine beaches backed by mountainous jungle terrain, is commonly known as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Costa Alegre</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Costa Careyes</ENAMEX>. This <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">area</ENAMEX> has become a haven for both discriminating <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">travelers</ENAMEX> looking for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">super-</ENAMEX>exclusive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX> and budget-conscious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> seeking secluded beaches off the beaten path. A collection of upscale and unusual resorts, plus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> stellar oceanside <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">golf courses</ENAMEX> are bringing attention to this exquisite section of coast.
A large, all-inclusive hotel and an adjacent holistic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> have most of lovely <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tenacatita Bay</ENAMEX> to themselves. There are campsites on beaches fringed with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocoa</ENAMEX> palms down side <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX> all along the coast. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> rises and falls, twists and turns as it crosses ridge after jungle <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ridge</ENAMEX>, sloping steeply westward like the backs of great green <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> leaning down to drink from the sea.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barra de Navidad</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Patricio‚ÄìMelaque</ENAMEX> are located at opposite ends of a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5-km</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3-mile</NUMEX>) beach backed by a lagoon. Both little <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> have a languid atmosphere and have remained small enough to enable you to really know the place within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the first few hours</TIMEX> after arrival, yet also offer a pleasant selection of accommodations at very reasonable prices. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barra de Navidad</ENAMEX> exudes a funky charm, and is as casual and rustic a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> seaside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> as you‚Äôre likely to find. Unpaved <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> and palapa-topped seafood <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shacks</ENAMEX> offer an intriguing contrast to the large and luxurious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grand Bay Hotel</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">golf course</ENAMEX>, just a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">50-cent</NUMEX> panga ride away on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Isla Navidad</ENAMEX>. The combination of an idyllic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> and spicy local color is beguiling.
Manzanillo 
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manzanillo</ENAMEX> is a dichotomous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">place¬†‚Äî¬†it</ENAMEX> is both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mexico‚</ENAMEX>Äôs busiest commercial seaport and a tranquil, traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of simple seafood <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, shell <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, and a few salsa <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clubs</ENAMEX>.
For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manzanillo</ENAMEX> has been known for its wide, curving beaches, legendary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sportfishing</ENAMEX>, and a highly praised diversity of dive sites. Now however, between its own golf links and those located up the northern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">coast</ENAMEX>, it is rivaling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los Cabos</ENAMEX> as the emerging golf capital of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manzanillo</ENAMEX> has an enticingly tropical geography, comprised of vast groves of tall <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">palms</ENAMEX>, abundant <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">mango trees</ENAMEX>, and successive coves graced with smooth sand beaches. To the north, mountains blanketed with <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">palms</ENAMEX> rise alongside the shoreline. And over it all lies the veneer of perfect weather¬†‚Äî¬†balmy temperatures and year-round sea breezes. Even the approach by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manzanillo</ENAMEX> showcases the promise of a perfect <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">vacation¬†‚Äî¬†you fly</ENAMEX> in over the beach and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">golf course</ENAMEX>.
A visit to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> itself is as mandatory as a stroll in the plaza¬†‚Äî¬†a ritual here for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locals</ENAMEX>. Around sunset, they gather and gossip on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> benches, while <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> congregate on the surrounding telephone wires, cooing and calling out until, eventually, handfuls of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX>, sold by the plastic baggie-full around the plaza‚Äôs perimeter, are tossed out to them. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Children</ENAMEX> chase after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX>, stopping just short of the splashing fountains, their laughter competing with the chimes of the church bells. In the background, multicolor <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> in many hues cascade down the surrounding hillsides, and a game of pickup <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">basketball</ENAMEX> is played on the public <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> that fronts the harbor. Located almost behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, stretching south along the coast for <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">miles</NUMEX>, is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Laguna de Cuyutl√°n</ENAMEX>, a stellar birdwatching site.
As you depart the downtown area, you pass by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museo Universitario de Arqueolog√≠a de Manzanillo</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University Museum of Archeology</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Manzanillo)¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†easily the region‚Äôs most impressive collection of regional historical artifacts¬†‚Äî¬†and the large commercial wharves before reaching the turnoff to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Las Brisas</ENAMEX>. This long stretch of golden sand beach on a peninsula separates Manzanillo bay from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Pedrito</ENAMEX> lagoon, another birdwatching haven. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Brisas Peninsula</ENAMEX> is where several older, budget <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> are located, along with a handful of recommendable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>. In general, this section of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manzanillo</ENAMEX> is quite run-down, having never recovered from damage caused by a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX> earthquake.
<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">About seven miles</NUMEX> west of downtown, lies the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pen√≠nsula de Santiago, Manzanillo‚</ENAMEX>Äôs best known landmark. For many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">travelers</ENAMEX>, this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> is synonymous with the famed all-white world of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Las Hadas (‚Äúthe Fairies‚Äù</ENAMEX>) and its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">adjoining golf course</ENAMEX>. Set on a southern promontory of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Santiago Peninsula</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Las Hadas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">gazes</ENAMEX> across <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manzanillo Bay</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, but is a world apart in character. Its <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Moorish</ENAMEX> architecture, which looks something like a setting for <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Arabian Nights</ENAMEX>, became renown as the place where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bo Derek</ENAMEX> showed her appreciation for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ravel‚</ENAMEX>Äôs bolero in the movie Ten. <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Las Hadas</ENAMEX> was built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1970s</TIMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bolivian</ENAMEX> tin multimillionaire <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Antinor Pati√±o</ENAMEX> as a private, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">super-</ENAMEX>exclusive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> and a respite from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acapulco‚</ENAMEX>Äôs excessive glitz. Its presence spawned construction up and down the adjoining beaches, making <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Santiago Peninsula</ENAMEX> the most desirable address in town, especially for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manzanillo</ENAMEX>.
At <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">La Mantarraya</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">golf course</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Santiago Peninsula</ENAMEX> was considered among the top <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX> in the world, but it‚Äôs been upshot by newer entries. Local legend has it that when the course was under construction, pre-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanic</ENAMEX> ceramic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">figurines</ENAMEX>, idols, and beads were dug up at the spot where the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">14th</NUMEX> hole now lies; it is believed to have been an important ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">burial site</ENAMEX>. The nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">El Tesoro</ENAMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Treasure</ENAMEX>) beach is also the subject of local lore¬†‚Äî¬†many believe this beach still may hold buried treasure from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">galleons</ENAMEX>, whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crews</ENAMEX> used the harbor during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16th century</TIMEX>.
On the other side of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santiago</ENAMEX> lies a succession of locally popular beaches, including the long stretch known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Playa Olas Altas</ENAMEX>, named after the high waves that regularly break here. Just beyond is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Playa Miramar</ENAMEX>, prized by bodysurfers and boogie borders for its challenging waves. The adjacent beachfront has a collection of colorful beach <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> for enjoying a casual day at the beach.
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Ixtapa/Zihuatanejo</ENAMEX> 
These neighboring <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX>, when combined, provide the quintessential <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> beach experience. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ixtapa</ENAMEX> is a planned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> with modern <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> and slick shopping, while <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Zihuatanejo¬†‚Äî¬†referred</ENAMEX> to by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locals</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zihua</ENAMEX> (pronounced see-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wah)¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†is the original rustic beach <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>.
Zihuatanejo 
Zihuatanejo became popular among beachcombers from abroad because it had what they wanted: a sparkling bay divided into intimate stretches of sand by outcroppings of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rock</ENAMEX> and wooded knolls, plus simple pleasures that included swimming, sunning, and the freshest of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX> and seafood. Cheap <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rum</ENAMEX> were an added bonus.
During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Zihuatanejo‚</ENAMEX>Äôs charm attracted numerous <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> who have become regulars of this no-longer-rustic beach <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX>. A number have been so taken by its balmy beauty that they decided to make <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zihua</ENAMEX> their permanent home, giving it a continental air.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> embraces the beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bay of Zihuatanejo</ENAMEX> with the downtown area to the north, and the beautiful long beach of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Playa Larga</ENAMEX> to the east. The heart of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zihuatanejo</ENAMEX> is the waterfront <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">boardwalk</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paseo del Pescador</ENAMEX>, also referred to as the malec√≥n. Unlike most <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zihuatanejo</ENAMEX> doesn‚Äôt have a main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Plaza de Armas</ENAMEX>. Instead, the centerpiece of the downtown <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">promenade</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">La Cancha</ENAMEX>, a basketball <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX>, that serves as the gathering place for bands that play on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> evenings, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendors</ENAMEX> who offer tamales and elotes (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">corn</ENAMEX>) for sale, along with sweet homemade popsicles flavored with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chocolate</ENAMEX>, cinnamon, or vanilla.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Cancha</ENAMEX> fronts the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Playa Municipal</ENAMEX>, where local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fishermen</ENAMEX> pull their small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> onto the sand, making it an excellent place to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>-watch and take in the daily village life. Many of downtown <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Zihuatanejo‚Äôs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX>-lined <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> are designated as zona peatonal (pedestrian zone), making it especially welcoming to those who prefer to explore on foot.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zihuatanejo</ENAMEX> also has one of the better archeological <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific</ENAMEX> coast. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museo Arqueol√≥gico de la Costa Grande</ENAMEX>, located near the eastern end of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paseo del Pescador</ENAMEX>, traces the history of this area from pre-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanic</ENAMEX> times, when the place was known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zihuatl√°n</ENAMEX>, through the colonial era. Most of the exhibits show that the area was an important trading <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">zone</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX>, with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">items</ENAMEX> from far-off cultures such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Teotihuacan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toltec</ENAMEX>.
Past the municipal beach lies <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Playa La Madera</ENAMEX>, once a loading point for lumber¬†‚Äî¬†hence the name, which means ‚Äúwood beach.‚Äù It has fine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">grayish-white sand</ENAMEX>, and the swells that enter it break suddenly into small waves that roll gently and then recede, with little undertow. This beach‚Äôs calm <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX> are ideal for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and easy swimming. A few beachside <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> offer <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drinks</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">snacks</ENAMEX>, and the ever-present beach <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendors</ENAMEX> offer their wares to the sunning <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Playa La Ropa</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zihuatanejo‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most popular beach, a long crescent of golden sand that stretches south past <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">La Madera</ENAMEX> beach and receives the gentle breezes that blow in from the bay. The beach was named for the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">yards</NUMEX> of colorful cloth that washed ashore <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries ago</TIMEX>, following a trading galleon‚Äôs wreck. The waves are generally too gentle and quick-breaking for surfing, but you will find jet-skis, catamarans, and windsurf <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boards</ENAMEX> for rent here. Several beachfront <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> offer food and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drinks</ENAMEX>. Alongside this beach you will find lovely, and rather exclusive, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B&Bs</ENAMEX>.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Playa</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Las Gatas</ENAMEX>, once a walled pre-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanic</ENAMEX> wading pool, earned its name from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">whiskered nurse sharks</ENAMEX> that used to frequent the surrounding <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wall</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Las Gatas</ENAMEX> is the most pleasant beach for swimming and children‚Äôs activities. The coral beach has exceptionally clear waters, with little or no surf, and practically no undertow. Located across the bay from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Playa La Ropa</ENAMEX>, it is easily reached by a short ride aboard small, shaded <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> that run from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Muelle</ENAMEX> (the town <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pier</ENAMEX>) every <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10-minutes</TIMEX>. Open air <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, some fancier than others, offer local delicacies, including extraordinarily fresh pink-tongued clams. <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Las Gatas</ENAMEX> is a departing point for dive trips to some excellent sites.
Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zihuatanejo</ENAMEX> has grown more sophisticated, with trendy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boutiques</ENAMEX> and candle-lit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> that overlook the bay, those looking for a more developed tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> should take advantage of the luxury accommodations of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ixtapa</ENAMEX>. A new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">highway</ENAMEX>, finished in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>, connects <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 6km</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4 miles</NUMEX>) between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zihua</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ixtapa</ENAMEX>.
Ixtapa 
In a pristine setting of great natural beauty, this pre-planned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FONATUR</ENAMEX> development rose to glory in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 1960s</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ixtapa</ENAMEX> has become known for its manicured luxury along its long stretch of beach. It also offers challenging <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">golf</ENAMEX>, tennis, windsurfing, and all the amenities of a top <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX>, without the traffic and hustle of a place the size of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Acapulco</ENAMEX>. Its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> are ultra-modern, yet were designed to fit harmoniously into the tropical environment. Minibuses <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">shuttle</ENAMEX> back and forth between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX>, or you can rent a moped for more independence.
The inland side of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ixtapa</ENAMEX> is marked by the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">18-hole Club de Golf Ixtapa</ENAMEX>. Nearly everything in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ixtapa</ENAMEX> lies along the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">boulevard</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paseo Ixtapa</ENAMEX>, which runs parallel to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX>-lined main beach, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Playa Palmar</ENAMEX>. This beach offers <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">41/2 km</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 miles</NUMEX>) of beautiful white <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sand</ENAMEX> and deep azure waters. Even though the beach faces the open sea, there are several spots where offshore rocks and islands quiet the surf and make the waters suitable for swimming. The undertow here, however, is usually quite strong, and extreme caution should be taken. For a stunning view of this beach, ride the cable <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Faro</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX>, located on the southern end of the beach, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">upstairs</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pacifica Hotel</ENAMEX>. At the far end of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paseo Ixtapa</ENAMEX> lies <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Marina Ixtapa</ENAMEX>, with fine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, private <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">yacht</ENAMEX> slips, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Marina Ixtapa Golf Course</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ixtapa</ENAMEX> also has its share of trendy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boutiques</ENAMEX>, plus lively nightlife, and refined dining. A bicycle <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">track</ENAMEX> begins at the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">marina</ENAMEX>, continues around the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">golf course</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heads</ENAMEX> on towards the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">northern</ENAMEX> beach of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Playa Linda</ENAMEX>.
The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> beach in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ixtapa</ENAMEX>, coming from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zihua</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Playa Hermosa</ENAMEX>, which can only be accessed through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Westin Hotel</ENAMEX>. This small beach is dramatically framed by rock formations. The surf varies <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seasonally</TIMEX> from minimal to quite rough, and has become somewhat of a private beach for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Westin‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guests</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Playa Linda</ENAMEX> is located <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">12km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">8 miles</NUMEX>) north of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ixtapa</ENAMEX>. This is a long beach with golden <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sands</ENAMEX> that seem to stretch endlessly to the north. It is the primary out-of-town beach, with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> sports <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">equipment</ENAMEX> rentals, fishing charters, and horseback riding. The ferry to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isla Ixtapa</ENAMEX> leaves from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">jetty</ENAMEX> located on the southern end of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Playa Linda</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isla Ixtapa</ENAMEX> is among the area‚Äôs most memorable sites, and is easily reached by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX>. The island‚Äôs small beaches have managed to maintain their natural beauty, despite the throngs of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> that land <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX>. Palapa <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">proprietors</ENAMEX> do a great job of keeping all trash off the island. It is a perfect place to spend <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> enjoying the beach, swimming, snorkeling, and eating fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> and seafood at any one of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a dozen or so</NUMEX> palapa <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Hundreds</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">colored fish dart</ENAMEX> among the rocks just offshore. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boats</ENAMEX> ride back to the mainland <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">every few minutes</TIMEX>, with the last boat leaving around 5pm (always double-check the departure time of the last <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX>).
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Day Trips from Zihuatanejo</ENAMEX> and Ixtapa
Another excellent spot to spend <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a day</TIMEX> away from the more crowded beaches of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ixtapa</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zihuatanejo</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Playa Larga</ENAMEX>. A beautiful, uncrowded beach that stretches for <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">miles</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Playa Larga</ENAMEX> is located south of the bay, between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zihuatanejo</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX>. The surf here is usually quite rough and with a strong undertow, so it is not recommended for swimming. However, the many small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> that border it make up for this shortfall by offering wading <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pools</ENAMEX> that are refilled <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX>, along with hammocks for lazing under the palapa shades, and fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> and seafood accompanied by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX>-cold <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beer</ENAMEX>. There is also the occasional musical rendering by a wandering beach <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">troubadour</ENAMEX>.
A countryside visit to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barra de Potos√≠</ENAMEX>, located <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">21 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">14 miles</NUMEX>) south of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zihuatanejo</ENAMEX> offers a chance to see a small fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX>, coconut and mango <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plantations</ENAMEX>, and a lagoon known for the numerous tropical <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> that inhabit it.
Further south along the coast is the small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Petatl√°n</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Laguna de San Valent√≠n</ENAMEX>, which can also be visited as a day <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">trip from Zihua</ENAMEX>. Highlights of this trip may include a visit to the small town‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>, the local market where bartering is still practiced, the town‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> dating back to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th century</TIMEX>, and a chance to have lunch on a small island in the lagoon, amid <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of tropical <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Troncones</ENAMEX> is a tiny fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> located <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">30 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20 miles</NUMEX>) northwest of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ixtapa</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> can absolutely escape from it all. There is little more to do here beyond strolling along the beach, swimming, and savoring the fresh local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">seafood</ENAMEX>. This place offers several options for overnight stays from an exclusive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B&B</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">RV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX>, as well as camping on the beach. No public buses serve this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, so you‚Äôll have to hire a taxi to take you there, and arrange for the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">taxi</ENAMEX> to pick you up when you are ready to return.
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Acapulco</ENAMEX>
If beach <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX> are made for relaxing, then <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Acapulco</ENAMEX> is the exception that proves the rule. Here, the energy is turned up <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than a few notches</NUMEX>, and, if you do enjoy languid days in the sun, likely it‚Äôs only to rest up for playful <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">nights</TIMEX> at decadent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">discos</ENAMEX> or other nocturnal alternatives.
Though <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Acapulco</ENAMEX> is, admittedly, past its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prime</ENAMEX>, there are still plenty of reasons to visit and numerous ways to enjoy the famously sunny <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> there. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Acapulco</ENAMEX> remains <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mexico‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most traditional resort for those looking for a beach, yet also want to feel as if they‚Äôve been to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>. Where other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> have been accused of being homogenized to meet the tastes of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">North American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">travelers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Acapulco</ENAMEX> remains true to her essence, from the cacophony of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> filling colorful, public sands, to the classically <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">late nights</TIMEX> in glitzy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clubs</ENAMEX>.
And <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Acapulco</ENAMEX> has one thing that no other place has¬†‚Äî¬†the absolutely stunning view of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Acapulco Bay</ENAMEX>, which, day or <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>, is an image as memorable as any you‚Äôll come across in your travels.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Acapulco</ENAMEX> is more of a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> than other <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific</ENAMEX> coastal destinations, with high-rise <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> lined up like dominoes around the edge of the bay. It offers more options for dining, shopping, and other activities than anywhere else along <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexico‚Äôs western</ENAMEX> shoreline; many are geared for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>.
The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> cautionary note concerns the reputed lack of cleanliness in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Acapulco</ENAMEX>, especially in the waters of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Acapulco Bay</ENAMEX>. Great strides have been made in cleaning up the pollution that was widely reported in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1970s and 1980s</TIMEX>. However, the water remains less pristine than in resorts to the north and south, and most visitors¬<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">†‚Äî¬†wisely¬†‚Äî¬†prefer</ENAMEX> to swim in hotel <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pools</ENAMEX>. A public works program put in place in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1990s</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACA-Limpia</ENAMEX>, has also made progress in cleaning up the beaches and other public areas, including the heavily-trafficked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Costera</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">More than 20</NUMEX> powerboat <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sweepers</ENAMEX> are dispatched <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each day</TIMEX> to skim any floating debris from the water‚Äôs surface. More important, needed improvements in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">infrastructure¬†‚Äî¬†estimated</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over a billion</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">dollars¬†‚Äî¬†are</ENAMEX> nearing completion, which should also improve the cleanliness of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> and bay.
As it fell out of favor as an international darling, its prices adjusted out of necessity. Now, some exceptional values in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> and dining can be found, and today <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Acapulco</ENAMEX> is considered a value-packed destination, attracting more <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">national</ENAMEX> than foreign tourism.
Other new initiatives are also gaining momentum, including new eco-tourism oriented excursions, and a revival of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acapulco‚</ENAMEX>Äôs historic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>, in a similar fashion to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Miami‚Äôs South Beach</ENAMEX> district.
Through all the changes that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Acapulco</ENAMEX> has experienced over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</TIMEX>, this sultry diva of a destination continues to seduce <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>, and tempt them into ‚Äújust <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> more dance before calling it a night‚Ä¶‚Äù
Neighborhoods
Although it stretches for <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">almost 25 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">15.5 miles</NUMEX>) around the bay, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Acapulco</ENAMEX> can roughly be divided into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> main areas. The historic downtown is located on the northwestern edge of the bay while the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Costera</ENAMEX>, home of the high-rise lineup of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> and a wide stretch of golden beach, lies in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Las Brisas</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Acapulco Diamante</ENAMEX> areas¬†‚Äî¬†handily the most exclusive addresses in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Acapulco¬†‚Äî¬†are</ENAMEX> found south of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Acapulco Bay</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Historic Centro</ENAMEX>
Also known as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Acapulco Viejo</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Old Acapulco</ENAMEX>), this intriguing area is the part of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Acapulco</ENAMEX> that originally attracted the glamorous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">jet-setters</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> past, and which, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, is experiencing something of a renaissance. For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">travelers</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Acapulco</ENAMEX> have dismissed this section of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, which includes the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Pen√≠nsula de las Playas</ENAMEX> and extends east to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Papagayo Park</ENAMEX>, not knowing what they‚Äôre missing. Currently, it is where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acapulco‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most value-priced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> are found, along with budget dining choices and the typical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX> and services of any sizable <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>.
Older <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> here were constructed in various architectural styles, including some classic deco structures, and numerous faux-forties <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the hidden treasures of this part of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">home</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dolores Olmedo</ENAMEX>, decorated on the exterior with a colorful tile, stone, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">shell mosaic</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mexico‚Äôs</ENAMEX> master muralist, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diego Rivera</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rivera</ENAMEX>, who lived here during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the two years</TIMEX> preceding his death, created the mural in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1956</TIMEX>, taking <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18 months</TIMEX> to complete it. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> remains a private <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX> and not a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>; however there are additional murals by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rivera</ENAMEX> inside.
The centerpiece of downtown is its z√≥calo (central <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plaza</ENAMEX>), heavily laden with <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">shade trees</ENAMEX> and bordered by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acapulco‚</ENAMEX>Äôs principal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nuestra Se√±ora de la Soledad</ENAMEX>, as well as numerous, inexpensive caf√©s and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>. This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> is one of the more notable <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Acapulco</ENAMEX> The blue onion-like <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">domes</ENAMEX> are more <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian Orthodox</ENAMEX> than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roman Catholic</ENAMEX> in style¬†‚Äî¬†in fact, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> was originally built as a movie set. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Every Sunday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</TIMEX>, local bands serenade the plaza‚Äôs numerous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>. Across from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plaza</ENAMEX> is the beach, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Playa Manzanillo</ENAMEX>, where sport-fishing charters, as well as pleasure and excursion <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> depart.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acapulco‚</ENAMEX>Äôs historic landmarks is the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fuerte de San Diego</ENAMEX>, originally built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1616</TIMEX> to protect against <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pirate attacks</ENAMEX>, and later renovated following extensive earthquake damage in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1776</TIMEX>. Acapulco‚Äôs most notable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Museo Hist√≥rico de Acapulco</ENAMEX>, is now located in this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX>, chronicling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acapulco‚</ENAMEX>Äôs exotic history as a trading <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">fort</ENAMEX> is located up a hill and to the right of the zocalo, just off the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Costera</ENAMEX>.
Also near the z√≥calo are the most authentic shopping experiences¬<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">†‚Äî¬†the Mercado de Artesan√≠as</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crafts Market</ENAMEX>) and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mercado Municipal</ENAMEX>, which sells fresh and prepared <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX>.
Just up the hill behind the z√≥calo, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about ten minutes</TIMEX> walking time, is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">La Quebrada</ENAMEX>, home of the famed cliff-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">divers</ENAMEX>. Although the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midday</TIMEX> and sunset shows are impressive, the most popular exhibitions take place after dark, when the cliff <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">divers</ENAMEX> plunge from this <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">130-foot</NUMEX> cliff while holding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">flaming</ENAMEX> torches. Just around the bend from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Quebrada</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Playa La Angosta</ENAMEX>, a sheltered and often deserted cove.
However, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caleta</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Caletilla</ENAMEX>, coves located south of the z√≥colo on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Peninsula de las Playas</ENAMEX>, are the most popular public beaches in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Acapulco</ENAMEX>. They are colorful sites, with palapa-topped beach <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, bright-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hued</NUMEX> passenger <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX>, water sports‚Äìequipment rental <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stands</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fishermen</ENAMEX> selling their fresh catch to beachgoers. These side-by-side beaches are separated by a narrow, rocky peninsular, which is the site of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">M√°gico Mundo Marino</ENAMEX> water <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">aquarium</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Roqueta Island</ENAMEX> sits <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> a mile across a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caleta</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caletilla</ENAMEX> beaches, and is the destination for the numerous glass-bottom <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> that cruise over a sunken statue of the Virgin of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guadalupe</ENAMEX>, before circling around this outcropping of rocks. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roqueta</ENAMEX> is in the process of gaining national status as a protected nature reserve, but <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, is only the site of a rather small, dismal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">zoo</ENAMEX> with claims that it is the world‚Äôs only <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">zoo</ENAMEX> on an <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">island¬†‚Äî¬†however</ENAMEX>, it‚Äôs not worth disembarking to visit.
Traveling east from the z√≥calo and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Playa Manzanillo</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Playa Los Hornos</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Playa Hornitos</ENAMEX>. Both of these traditional beaches offer wide stretches of sand and numerous palapa <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> where you can pass <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX>, while enjoying fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seafood</ENAMEX> and cold tropical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drinks</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hornitos</ENAMEX> forms the edge of the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">52-acre</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Papagayo Park</ENAMEX>, considered to be the eastern boundary that separates <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Acapulco Viejo</ENAMEX> from the newer <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hotel Zone</ENAMEX>.
Located <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about seven miles</NUMEX> north of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, accessible by public bus or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">taxi</ENAMEX>, is the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">northern</ENAMEX> beach area, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pie de la Cuesta</ENAMEX>, with its scenic sandbar and numerous seaside <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>. The adjacent <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Coyuca Lagon</ENAMEX> was the shooting location for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rambo II</ENAMEX>, filmed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1985</TIMEX>, one of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 250</NUMEX> movies that have been shot in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Acapulco</ENAMEX>. Even more significant, this tropical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">estuary</ENAMEX> is rich with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bird</ENAMEX> life, and has become the focus of current eco-tourism efforts. Bordered by palm <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>, the bay at the mouth of this freshwater lagoon is a popular site for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> skiing. Boat rides through <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canals</ENAMEX> can stop at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Isla de los Pajaros</ENAMEX> for lunch. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mudbaths</ENAMEX> and spectacular sunset viewing are additional attractions, and palapa <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> are available where you can dine. Be aware that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> is very rough, and swimming is not recommended in the open sea.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Costera Hotel</ENAMEX> Zone
This popular, lively <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hotel</ENAMEX> Zone borders <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Condesa</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paraiso</ENAMEX> beaches on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> side, and the broad main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">avenue</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Costera Miguel Alem√°n</ENAMEX>, on the other. It is also known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zona Dorado</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Golden Acapulco</ENAMEX>. This <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">8 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 mile</NUMEX>) length of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">boulevard</ENAMEX> hugs the edge of the bay, and is lined with towering <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">strip malls</ENAMEX>, movie <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">theatres</ENAMEX>, and a string of open-air beach bars. In the evenings, calendrias¬†‚Äî¬†balloon-draped <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horse carriages¬†‚Äî¬†line</ENAMEX> up to take <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> for rides.
Among the principal attractions of this area are the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>-hole public <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Club de Golf Acapulco</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Acapulco International Center</ENAMEX> (considered the grandest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">convention center</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>), and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Centro Internacional de Convivencia Infantil</ENAMEX> (CICI) children‚Äôs activity <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">89</NUMEX>).
At the eastern edge of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zona Dorado</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Playa Icacos</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> naval <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">La</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Base</ENAMEX>. Just before reaching <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">La Base</ENAMEX>, on the beach side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Costera</ENAMEX>, is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Casa de la Cultura</ENAMEX>, a small cultural <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> with rotating art exhibits and an archeological <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Las Brisas</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Acapulco</ENAMEX> Diamante
With its hillsides of cascading villas and luxury <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX>, this is the most exclusive section of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Acapulco</ENAMEX>. The best selection of gourmet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> and the famed cliffside <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">discos</ENAMEX>, with spectacular views of the twinkling lights of the bay and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, are here.
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Las Brisas</ENAMEX> is more or less defined by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX> of the same name, with its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 250</NUMEX> individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guest pools</ENAMEX> and the pink-and-white theme that extends to the hotel‚Äôs private fleet of rental <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">jeeps</ENAMEX>.
Driving further south along the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Costera¬†‚Äî¬†whose</ENAMEX> name changes to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carretera Esc√©nica</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Scenic Highway)¬†‚Äî¬†you‚Äôll</ENAMEX> reach the posh residential area of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Acapulco Diamante</ENAMEX>, and the public beach, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Playa Marqu√©s.</ENAMEX> This beach is located in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Marqu√©s</ENAMEX>, a smaller ‚Äúbay within a bay,‚Äù and has a clean swimming beach and a row of rustic palapa-topped beach <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>. The calm <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX> make it ideal for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> skiing and other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> sports.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Just past</TIMEX> here is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puente Diamante</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Acapulco Princess Golf Club</ENAMEX>, and a row of luxury <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> that fronts the open <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific Ocean</ENAMEX>.

A <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Day Trip to Taxco</ENAMEX> 
Admittedly, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Acapulco</ENAMEX> is not a city brimming over with culture, but located just <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a few short hours</TIMEX> away is one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mexico‚</ENAMEX>Äôs classical colonial treasures, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taxco</ENAMEX>. It‚Äôs an easy day trip from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Acapulco</ENAMEX> to this famed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">silver</ENAMEX>-mining <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, and worthwhile for anyone interested in experiencing more of this country‚Äôs historical past.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Taxco</ENAMEX> sits atop a hill among the tumbling hillsides of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sierra Madre Mountains</ENAMEX>, which were once rich with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">silver</ENAMEX>. Though the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mines</ENAMEX> have mostly been tapped out, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taxco‚</ENAMEX>Äôs reputation as the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Silver City of Mexico</ENAMEX> remains, due to the skilled <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workmanship</ENAMEX> and artistry of local silversmiths in creating <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">silver</ENAMEX> jewelry and other artifacts.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> itself¬†‚Äî¬†declared a national monument in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1928¬†‚</NUMEX>Äî¬†is one of the most picturesque in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, with narrow, winding cobblestone <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> that pass white stucco <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> topped with red-tile roofs, and adorned with <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> tumbling from window boxes. At <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5,000 feet</NUMEX> elevation, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taxco</ENAMEX> offers a succession of picturesque views, each seemingly more enchanting than the last.
Among the numerous silversmith <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> here, you‚Äôll find several landmarks. Most notable is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Church of San Sebasti√°n</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Prisca</ENAMEX>, located on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Plaza Borda</ENAMEX>. This elaborate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> was built by silver <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">magnate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Borda</ENAMEX> as a show of his appreciation to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> and to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Almighty</ENAMEX> for the wealth he accumulated here. Additional attractions are the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Museo de Taxco Guillermo Spratling</ENAMEX>, featuring a collection of pre-Columbian artifacts, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Silver Museum</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Casa Humboldt</ENAMEX>, which details the past of this historic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taxco</ENAMEX> is located <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">275 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">165 miles</NUMEX>) north of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Acapulco</ENAMEX>, and can be reached in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about three hours</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>, traveling the toll <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about US$20</NUMEX>). Guided tours traveling by bus are also available through most <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Acapulco</ENAMEX> travel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> or hotel hospitality desks.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Puerto</ENAMEX> Escondido 
This coastal <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> is the ideal place for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">travelers</ENAMEX> who are looking for a more laid-back beach village ambiance rather than a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúmade-for-tourism‚</ENAMEX>Äù <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX>. It‚Äôs the best of its kind in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific Mexico</ENAMEX>, with a good selection of independently owned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, plus a rousing nightlife, and lots of truly adventurous eco-<ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">tours</ENAMEX>.
For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Escondido¬</ENAMEX>†¬<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">†‚Äî¬†called simply ‚ÄúPuerto‚Äù</ENAMEX> by the locals¬†‚Äî¬†has been known as a surfers‚Äô haven, due to the awesome break at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Playa Zicatela</ENAMEX>, known as <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">‚ÄúThe Mexican Pipeline</ENAMEX>.‚Äù The site of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> international surf competitions during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fall</TIMEX> swells, it continues to draw those in search of the perfect wave as well as scores of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">travelers</ENAMEX> content to gaze at the ocean, soak up the sun, and chat about the experience over a cold <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beer</ENAMEX> or iced <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">latte</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Puerto Escondido</ENAMEX> is currently popular with younger, predominately <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">travelers</ENAMEX>, and, simply stated , offers the best overall value in a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> beach <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">vacation today</TIMEX>.
It‚Äôs easy to get around the central beach and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town areas</ENAMEX> by walking, though <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bicycle</ENAMEX> rentals are also a practical option. At the center of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> is a curving stretch of beach, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Playa Principal</ENAMEX>, where colorful panga <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> line up offering fishing trips or tours to secluded beaches. The main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> that runs parallel to this beach is known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adoqu√≠n</ENAMEX>, named for the hexagon-shaped interlocking bricks used in its paving. During <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX>, traffic is allowed for making deliveries, but after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2pm</TIMEX>, it‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pedestrians</ENAMEX> only. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hotels</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX>, and travel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> are all conveniently located here.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Playa Marinero</ENAMEX> extends from the central beach to the rocky outcropping, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rocas del Morro</ENAMEX>, that marks the beginning of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zicatela</ENAMEX> and its impressive waves. Along <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Marinero</ENAMEX>, several rustic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> offer beach chairs and a place to pass <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> while enjoying cool <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drinks</ENAMEX> and fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seafood</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Puerto Angelito</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Playa Manzanillo</ENAMEX> share the same sheltered cove, but are separated by a rocky outcropping. Located <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">just</NUMEX> west of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, they are accessible by walking from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> along a dirt <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>, or by a launch <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">taxi boat</ENAMEX> from the main beach. Here, the surf subsides enough for comfortable swimming, and hammock and palapa shade rentals are available. This is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Escondido‚</ENAMEX>Äôs best spot for snorkeling.
The main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> for dining and nightlife is the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> fronting <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Zicatela</ENAMEX> beach, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Avenida del Morro</ENAMEX>. Increasingly, attention is turning to this area, where there are clean, inexpensive <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">bungalow</TIMEX>-style <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX>, caf√©s that feature cheap, surfer-size breakfasts, cyber-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stations</ENAMEX> for checking e-mail, and abundant beach <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX> with extended happy <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX>.
Recently, there is more of a health-conscious air to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto</ENAMEX>, with yoga classes, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetarian meals</ENAMEX>, and book <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchanges</ENAMEX> gaining in popularity, with herbal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> and espresso drinks becoming almost as ubiquitous as cold cervezas. During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the winter months</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto</ENAMEX> is also noted for its excellent live music scene, though it depends in part on who happens to be in town at the time.
Concerns about safety have led civic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> to place lifeguard <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stations</ENAMEX> along the main beaches and install nighttime lighting.
You can fly in from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico City</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oaxaca</ENAMEX>, drive, or take a bus along the scenic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Mexican 175</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">highway</ENAMEX> through the mountains from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oaxaca</ENAMEX>. It‚Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only 250 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">155 miles</NUMEX>) but takes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a full day</TIMEX>. You can also arrive by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">taxi</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Huatulco</ENAMEX>, which takes <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">just about two hours</TIMEX> along a fairly well-maintained two-lane <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">highway</ENAMEX>.

The diverse geography surrounding <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Escondido</ENAMEX> is complemented by a collection of small coastal <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX>, making it an ideal place from which to explore some uniquely <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> cultural experiences.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southern Coast</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Puerto Angel</ENAMEX>
The beaches south of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Escondido</ENAMEX> are prime nesting grounds for the endangered <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Ridley sea turtles</ENAMEX>. During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer months</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> to this area may encounter <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">turtles</ENAMEX> laying their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX> in the sand, or hatchlings making their <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> instinctive voyage to sea. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Centro Mexicano la Tortuga</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">aquarium</ENAMEX> and research <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> was established by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX>, in the beach village of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mazunte</ENAMEX>. Located <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 72 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">45 miles</NUMEX>) south of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Escondido</ENAMEX>, (take the clearly marked turnoff to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Puerto Angel</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mex</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">200</NUMEX> south) it showcases the various species of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">turtles</ENAMEX> found along <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> beaches, and is involved in efforts along this coast to protect the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">turtle nests</ENAMEX>.
This coast also has a succession of truly idyllic beaches, wide open and wild¬†‚Äî¬†but be aware that the currents here are extremely strong, and swimming is not recommended. However, enjoying a lunch of fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>, followed by a siesta in a hammock strung between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> palms makes the trip absolutely worthwhile. The loveliest beach is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Agustinillo</ENAMEX>; the most renown is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zipolite</ENAMEX>, for its acceptance of nude sunbathing. Though <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> law prohibits nudity of any kind on its beaches, custom dictates a spirit of tolerance here. As a result, the small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> at this beach attracts free <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spirits</ENAMEX> to its inventive collection of budget accommodations‚Äî¬†often consisting of little more than sleeping hammocks.
An additional <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8 km</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 miles</NUMEX>) down the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">coast</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mazunte</ENAMEX> is the dusty beach village <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Puerto Angel</ENAMEX>, once considered a prime destination for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">backpackers</ENAMEX> and budget <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">travelers</ENAMEX>. This place truly is a ‚Äúsleepy little fishing vill age,‚Äù though a succession of natural disasters (hurricane and earthquake damage in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past four years</TIMEX>) have made it less desirable for long-term stays. In addition, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Naval Base</ENAMEX> is what now dominates the once picturesque central <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> beach. The best place to spend some relaxation time is at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the beachfront <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Playa Pante√≥n</ENAMEX>, the lively cove located in front of the town <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cemetery</ENAMEX> (pante√≥n means ‚Äúcemetery‚Äù).
Nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Lagoons and Natural Attractions</ENAMEX>
The beaches to the north and south of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Escondido</ENAMEX> are interspersed with lagoons, estuaries, and mangrove swamps, which contribute to making this region a fertile ecological paradise. <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">About 24 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">15 miles</NUMEX>) west of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Escondido</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laguna Manialtepec</ENAMEX>, a deep lagoon, thick with vegetation and brimming with tropical <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX>, including the ibis, a variety of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">herons</ENAMEX>, parrots, egrets, and several species of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ducks</ENAMEX>.
The <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50-square mile</NUMEX> national <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lagunas de Chacahua</ENAMEX> is located <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">66 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">41 miles</NUMEX>) to the north of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Escondido</ENAMEX>. It is comprised of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">32 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20 miles</NUMEX>) of fine, sandy beaches, backed by a pair of lagoons and jungle mangroves teeming with a changing array of tropical and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">migratory birds</ENAMEX>. Though <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crocodiles</ENAMEX> were hunted out in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1970s</TIMEX>, a crocodile hatchery in the village of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chacahua</ENAMEX>, located on the western edge of the lagoon, is steadily bringing them back.
Another neighboring venue for birdwatching is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ventanilla Estuary</ENAMEX>, where iguanas and crocodiles can be viewed in their natural habitat. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iguanas</ENAMEX> can also be seen at the nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">El Potrero</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">iguana ranch</ENAMEX>.
Heading into the foothills of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sierra de Miahuatl√°n</ENAMEX>, located north of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Escondido</ENAMEX>, are numerous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">trails</ENAMEX> for hiking or horseback riding. This mountainous jungle <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> also features a few places of particular interest, including the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atotonilco</ENAMEX> hot springs, considered to be healing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX> by the indigenous <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chatino</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> of the area. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Macuil</ENAMEX> waterfall is not only a spectacular site, but offers cool, natural freshwater <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pools</ENAMEX> for swimming. Another waterfall can be enjoyed near the mountain village of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">San Gabriel Mixtepec</ENAMEX>, a small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> nestled between several <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plantations</ENAMEX>. Nearby, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mixtec</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jamiltepec</ENAMEX> offers a rare look at a quiet, traditional, indigenous <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>.
Huatulco 
Mexico‚Äôs newest planned <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚Äúresort,‚Äù the Bays of Huatulco</ENAMEX>, is still evolving, but has become known as the most eco-sensitive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> along <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico‚Äôs Pacific</ENAMEX> coast. It is best known for its series of exquisite, protected, pristine bays. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diving</ENAMEX>, snorkeling, bay cruises, and other water-oriented activities are the main attractions here; dining, nightlife, and shopping remain very limited.
It‚Äôs biggest draw are the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX> beaches spread across the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">35 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">22 miles</NUMEX>) of coastline and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> bays, most of them still undeveloped. The fact that the area has been slow to catch on has resulted in a curious mix of ultra-modern infrastructure, and unspoiled natural areas. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Huatulco</ENAMEX> has what it takes to attract <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors¬</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">†‚Äî¬†including golf</ENAMEX>, tennis, water sports, fishing, a few <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> and night spots, luxury accommodations, and direct flights from selected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cities¬†‚Äî¬†but hasn‚Äôt</ENAMEX> developed its own distinct personality yet. For now, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Huatulco</ENAMEX> is ideal for those who want to enjoy the beauty of nature during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX>, then retreat to the well-appointed comfort of a luxury <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>.
The developed areas are easily divided into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> sections: the original resort development at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bah√≠a Santa Cruz</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tangolunda Bay</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crucecita</ENAMEX>, home to the area‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>. The original settlement in this area is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santa Mar√≠a de Huatulco</ENAMEX>, a more traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> found <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">17 miles</NUMEX> inland approaching the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sierra foothills</ENAMEX>, but generally not explored by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Huatulco</ENAMEX>.
Along with several older <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX>, and various tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">services</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bah√≠a Santa Cruz</ENAMEX> is home to a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">marina</ENAMEX>, from which numerous bay cruises and private panga fishing and sightseeing charters depart. Several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">seafood restaurants</ENAMEX> are located on a stretch of sheltered beach here, next to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">marina</ENAMEX>. They double as <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">daytime</TIMEX> beach <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clubs</ENAMEX>, and have water-sports equipment for rent, along with food and beverage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">service</ENAMEX>. Adjacent to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">marina</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚Äútown‚Äôs‚Äù</ENAMEX> central <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plaza</ENAMEX>, where the traditional central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">kiosk</ENAMEX> has been converted into a small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stand</ENAMEX> selling <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">espresso drinks</ENAMEX>, whole<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-bean coffee</ENAMEX> from the region, and tours to the neighboring <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee plantations¬†‚Äî¬†all</ENAMEX> sponsored by the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX>-growers‚Äô <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">co-op</ENAMEX>. A small artisan‚Äôs market separates the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plaza</ENAMEX> from the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>, calle <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ju√°rez.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crucecita</ENAMEX> is the true soul of this area, where all the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, services, and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> that make a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> run are located. Recently, a few stylish, yet inexpensive, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> have cropped up. The central <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plaza</ENAMEX> here is lovely and tree-lined, with a bandstand at its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>. It fronts the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iglesia Guadalupana</ENAMEX>, the main <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> in town, which is decorated with an enormous ceiling mural of the Virgin of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guadalupe</ENAMEX>, set in a background of indigo-blue night sky; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">additional</NUMEX>, brilliantly colored murals adorn the walls.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tangolunda Bay</ENAMEX> is where the larger <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX> developments are located, along with the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">18-hole Tangolunda Golf Course</ENAMEX>.
Chah√∫e <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bay</ENAMEX> lies between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tangolunda</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Cruz</ENAMEX> bays, and is the next to be slated for development. For now, it is home to a few beach <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clubs</ENAMEX> used by non-oceanfront <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX>, and a small marina that is under construction. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bah√≠a Conejos</ENAMEX> lies to the east of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tangolunda</ENAMEX>, and has residential developments already in progress.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Outlying Bays</ENAMEX>
Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> choose to visit the various outlying bays on an excursion <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX>. You can also charter a panga to drop you off, and arrange a return pick-up. The twin bays of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maguey</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">El √ìrgano</ENAMEX> are the closest and most popular, with a string of palapa <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendors</ENAMEX> who rent snorkeling gear and kayaks at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maguey</ENAMEX>.
Beyond these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> bays, the landscape has more of a desert-like appearance, with large <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">cacti</ENAMEX> interspersed among the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">palms</ENAMEX>. The bays of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cacaluta, Chachacual</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Riscalillo</ENAMEX> are still pristine and peaceful, with <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">overnight</TIMEX> camping allowed at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cacaluta</ENAMEX>. An exquisite beach is nestled into the cove of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bah√≠a San Agust√≠n</ENAMEX>, a small fisherman‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> located about an hour by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> west of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Cruz</ENAMEX>, also accessible by <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>. Known for its outstanding offshore coral reefs, it‚Äôs the favorite with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">divers</ENAMEX> and snorkelers.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Day Trips</ENAMEX> from Huatulco
The mountainous region north of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Huatulco</ENAMEX> is considered a prime area for the production of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pluma coffee</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> coffee noted for its powerful aroma and rich, earthy flavor. Visits to the various <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee fincas</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plantations</ENAMEX>), located <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">just under</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two hours</TIMEX> north of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crucecita</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>, make for an interesting day or overnight trip. The production <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">zone</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Huatulco‚Äôs coffee</ENAMEX> is comprised of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">over 50,000 hectares</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100,000 acres</NUMEX>), in the small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> surrounding the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Copalita River</ENAMEX>. Notable are the continued use of traditional cultivation methods with minimal use of agricultural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemicals</ENAMEX>, and the open-air drying of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beans</ENAMEX> in sun beds.
The mountain areas surrounding the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Capalita River</ENAMEX> are also the site of many natural treasures, including the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Capalitilla Cascades</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">About 30 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">18.5 miles</NUMEX>) north of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tangolunda</ENAMEX> a grouping of waterfalls, with heights averaging <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">80 feet</NUMEX>) form natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Jacuzzis</ENAMEX> and clear pools for swimming. The area is also popular for horseback riding and rappelling.
