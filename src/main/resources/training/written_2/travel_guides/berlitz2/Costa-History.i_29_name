A Brief History
The southern part of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> is at a geographical crossroads: It is the gateway between the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX>, and the crossing point between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Africa</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. The strategic importance of its location has given rise to a long and turbulent history.
The earliest evidence of human occupation is provided by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paleolithic</ENAMEX> cave paintings, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 25,000</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years old</TIMEX>, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cueva de la Pileta</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Neolithic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peoples</ENAMEX> arrived on the scene in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fourth millennium b.c.</TIMEX>, leaving behind signs of early attempts at agriculture and fragments of their pottery. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tribes of Iberians</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North Africa</ENAMEX> crossed over into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3000</TIMEX> b.c., and initiated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spainâ</ENAMEX>€™s <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> experiments in architecture; Spainâ€™s oldest structure <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stands</ENAMEX> near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Antequera</ENAMEX>, a dolmen <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">burial chamber</ENAMEX> known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cueva de Romeral</ENAMEX>. After <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">900 b.c.</TIMEX>, wandering bands of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Celts</ENAMEX> entered the peninsula from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">northern Europe</ENAMEX>, and brought to the area their knowledge of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bronze</ENAMEX> and iron work. As they moved farther south, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Celts</ENAMEX> merged with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iberians</ENAMEX>, and began to build walled <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> along the coast.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Traders</ENAMEX> and Colonizers
About the same time this was taking place, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phoenicians</ENAMEX> were already venturing across the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX> from their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">homeland</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">present-day</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lebanon</ENAMEX>. They reached <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> by about 1100 b.c., founding many trading settlements in the land they called <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Span or Spania</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gades</ENAMEX> (modern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">CÃ¡diz</ENAMEX>), followed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malaka</ENAMEX> (now <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MÃ¡laga</ENAMEX>), and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abdera</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adra</ENAMEX>) on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Costa del</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sol</ENAMEX>. Contact with the sophisticated <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phoenicians</ENAMEX> introduced the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Celt-Iberians</ENAMEX> to the concept of currency.
After <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 650 b.c.</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> entered the competition to exploit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spainâ</ENAMEX>€™s rich mineral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">deposits</ENAMEX> and fertile land. Their influence was short-lived, although the olive and the grape, both <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> legacies, soon became important, well-tended <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crops</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carthaginians</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">North African</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> related to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phoenicians</ENAMEX>, subsequently took over much of southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>, beginning with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CÃ</ENAMEX>¡diz in precisely 501 b.c. They extended their influence along the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">River Guadalquivir to Sevilla</ENAMEX>, then to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CÃ³rdoba</ENAMEX>. On the coast, they founded the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carteya</ENAMEX>, overlooking the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bay</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algeciras</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">240 b.c.</ENAMEX>). Carthage, challenged by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Punic War</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">264â€“241 b.c.</ENAMEX>), lost most of its <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">possessions</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Iberian attacks</ENAMEX>. But its fortunes changed with an initial victory in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Punic War</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">218â€“201 b.c.</ENAMEX>).
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Emboldened</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carthaginian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">general</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hannibal</ENAMEX> decided to advance on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX>. He led <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of historyâ€™s great military marches from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX>, crossing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pyrenees</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alps</ENAMEX> on the way. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Romans</ENAMEX> invaded <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> to cut off Hannibalâ€™s supply <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">routeÂ â€”Â and</ENAMEX> stayed there for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">some 600 years</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman Rule</ENAMEX>
It took the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Romans</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two centuries</TIMEX> to subdue the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iberians</ENAMEX>, but in the end most of the peninsula was incorporated into their new <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hispania</ENAMEX>. The south formed part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baetica</ENAMEX>, virtually identical to todayâ€™s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AndalucÃ­a</ENAMEX>, with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CÃ³rdoba</ENAMEX> its capital.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> presence had a far-reaching influence on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. A road <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> was constructed (the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Via Augusta</ENAMEX> ran the length of the south coast on its way to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridges</ENAMEX>, aqueducts, villas, and public <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> were added to the list of their achievements. The introduction of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Latin language</ENAMEX> (from which modern <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> developed), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> law (the basis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spainâ</ENAMEX>€™s legal system), and, eventually, Christianity brought about stability and a degree of unity.
Eventually the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roman Empire</ENAMEX> began to crumble. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Romans</ENAMEX> withdrew from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>. This left the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> to be overrun by various barbarian <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tribes</ENAMEX>, especially the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vandals</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Visigoths</ENAMEX> who, for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">some 300 years</TIMEX>, controlled much of southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>, eventually dominated these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tribes</ENAMEX>. Ultimately, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Visigothic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">kingdom</ENAMEX> proved unstable. The monarchy was elective, rather than hereditary, which led to disputes over succession to the crown; and in one of these, the disaffected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> looked to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North Africa</ENAMEX> for an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ally</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moors</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christians</ENAMEX>
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a.d. 711</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 12,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Berber</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> landed at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gibraltar</ENAMEX>, beginning a period of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moorish</ENAMEX> rule that was not broken by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christians</ENAMEX> until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nearly 800 years later</TIMEX>. Following their victory at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Battle of Guadalete</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moors</ENAMEX> (the name given to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslims</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>) carried all before them. They pushed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Visigoths</ENAMEX> into the northern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">mountains</ENAMEX>, and within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten years</TIMEX> most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> had fallen to Islam. To this day, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AlmuÃ±Ã©car</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tarifa, Algeciras, BenalmÃ¡dena</ENAMEX>, and several other southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> are known by their <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Arabic</ENAMEX> names. So is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AndalucÃ­a</ENAMEX>, for that matter, originally the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Moorish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">kingdom</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Al Andalus</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moors</ENAMEX> chose <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CÃ³rdoba</ENAMEX> as their seat of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>, and from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 8th</TIMEX> to the very <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 11th centuries</TIMEX>, it ranked as one of the great <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> of the world. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> was capital of the independent caliphate of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CÃ³rdoba</ENAMEX>, founded by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Abd</ENAMEX>-er-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rahman III</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">929</TIMEX>. Under the caliphs, southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> knew prosperity and peace, for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moors</ENAMEX> were relatively tolerant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rulers</ENAMEX> and taxed non-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">believers</ENAMEX> rather than trying to convert them. Intellectual life flourished, and great advances were made in science and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX>.
With the introduction of a sophisticated irrigation system, <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crops</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">cotton</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sugar cane</ENAMEX> were cultivated for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time on <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> soil, as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oranges</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peaches</ENAMEX>, and pomegranates. The manufacture of paper and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glass</ENAMEX> was another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moorish</ENAMEX> innovation. Skilled <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architects</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moors</ENAMEX> built numerous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palaces</ENAMEX> and fortifications. As superb <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">craftsmen</ENAMEX> they excelled in the production of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ceramics</ENAMEX> and tooled <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">leather</ENAMEX>, as well as delicate silverware.
The ensuing fall of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CÃ³rdoba</ENAMEX> was as remarkable as its rise. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1009</TIMEX>, the caliphate splintered into a number of small kingdoms called taifas, which were constantly at war. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christians</ENAMEX> in the north, seeing the enemy weakened and divided, captured the taifa of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toledo</ENAMEX>. Under threat of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">attack</ENAMEX>, the other taifas sought help from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Almoravids</ENAMEX>, fanatical <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Berber warriors</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Berbers</ENAMEX> marched against the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christians</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1086</TIMEX>, and went on to reduce <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moorish Spain</ENAMEX> to a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX> of their own <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">North African</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Empire</ENAMEX>.
For a time, therefore, the affairs of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> were administered from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Almoravid</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Granada</ENAMEX>, until they lost their grip on the peninsula, softened by their life of ease in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AndalucÃ­a.</ENAMEX> The pattern repeated itself <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a century later</TIMEX> when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moors</ENAMEX> invoked the aid of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Almohads</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1151</TIMEX>. These primitive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tribesmen</ENAMEX>, who came from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlas Mountains</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Morocco</ENAMEX>, soon made themselves the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">masters</ENAMEX> of southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>. They constructed major fortifications, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sevillaâ€™s AlcÃ¡zar</ENAMEX>, endowing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moors</ENAMEX> with sufficient strength to resist the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> forces a while longer.
The fortunes of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moors</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christians</ENAMEX> swayed back and forth until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1212</TIMEX>, when the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christians</ENAMEX> gained their <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> decisive victory at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Las Navas de Tolosa</ENAMEX> in northern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">AndalucÃ­a</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christians</ENAMEX> gradually captured and annexed the former bastions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moorish</ENAMEX> rule; in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1236</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CÃ³rdoba</ENAMEX> fell to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James the Conqueror</ENAMEX>, followed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sevilla</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1248</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moors</ENAMEX> were in retreat, retrenching along the coast and withdrawing to the security of their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">strongholds</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ronda</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Granada</ENAMEX>.
In military disarray and political decline, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moorish Spain</ENAMEX> nevertheless saw <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">another two</NUMEX> centuries of brilliance under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nasrid</ENAMEX> dynasty, founded in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Granada</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mohammed</ENAMEX> I in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1232</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Refugees</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CÃ³rdoba</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sevilla</ENAMEX> flooded into the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, bringing with them their many talents and skills and adding to the cityâ€™s brilliance. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">magnificent palace</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alhambra</ENAMEX> provided the setting for a luxurious court life dedicated to the pursuit of literature, music, and the arts.
Yet, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moorish</ENAMEX> fortresses along the coast soon came under attack. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sancho IV</ENAMEX> took <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gibraltar</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1310</TIMEX>, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christians</ENAMEX> later relinquished their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prize</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moors</ENAMEX> held on to it until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1462</TIMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1480s</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christians</ENAMEX> launched a new offensive; Ronda capitulated to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sovereigns</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferdinand</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isabella</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1485</TIMEX>, followed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MÃ</ENAMEX>¡laga in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1487</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AlmerÃ</ENAMEX>­a in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1488</TIMEX>. And all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Christendom</ENAMEX> gave thanks when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Granada</ENAMEX> was finally conquered in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1492</TIMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golden Age</ENAMEX>
With the triumph of Christianity, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> was united under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catholic Monarchs</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los Reyes CatÃ³licos</ENAMEX>), a title conferred by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pope Alexander VI</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferdinand II</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AragÃ³n</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Isabella I of Castile</ENAMEX>. Also in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1492</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cristobal ColÃ³n</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Christopher Columbus</ENAMEX>) discovered the New World in the name of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crown</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fanatical</ENAMEX> in their religious zeal, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX> and queen expelled all <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> who refused to convert to Christianity in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the same year</TIMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moors</ENAMEX> followed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1502</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rulers</ENAMEX> thus reneged on the promise of religious freedom they had given when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Granada</ENAMEX> surrendered. With the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> who left <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> went many of the countryâ€™s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bankers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">merchants</ENAMEX>, and with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moors</ENAMEX>, a good number of its agriculturists and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">laborers</ENAMEX>. The converted <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> (conversos) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moors</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moriscos</ENAMEX>) who remained in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> were viewed with suspicion by the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Inquisition</ENAMEX>, which had been established by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catholic Monarchs</ENAMEX> to stamp out heresy. Many were condemned to death, and still more fled the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> to escape persecution.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">The 16th century</TIMEX> was glorious for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>, with the conquest of the New World bringing much prestige and wealth. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1503</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Casa de ContrataciÃ³n</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sevilla</ENAMEX> was awarded a monopoly on trade with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Spainâ€™s territories</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Americas</ENAMEX>. For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than two centuries</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sevilla</ENAMEX> was the richest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>.
By comparison, the coastal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">settlements</ENAMEX> languished, and were subject to frequent raids by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barbary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pirates</ENAMEX>. Under constant threat for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than 200 years</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> drifted inland, taking refuge in fortified <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> hidden in the foothills of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sierras</ENAMEX>.
As <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Emperor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles V</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holy Roman Empire</ENAMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Habsburg Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX>, turned his attention to events in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Between 1521 and 1556</TIMEX>, he went to war with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> times, squandering the riches of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Americas</ENAMEX> on endless military campaigns. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles</ENAMEX> also had a weakness for such costly projects as his vast <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> on the grounds of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alhambra</ENAMEX>, which he commissioned in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1526</TIMEX>. Taxes imposed on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moors</ENAMEX> served to finance the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building works</ENAMEX>, which eventually had to be abandoned for lack of funds when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moriscos</ENAMEX> revolted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12 years</TIMEX> into the reign of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philip II</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1556â€“1598</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX> dispatched his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">half-brother</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Don Juan</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Austria</ENAMEX>, to quell the rebellion, which ended in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1570</TIMEX> with the defeat of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moriscos</ENAMEX> and their eventual dispersal. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1588</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philip II</ENAMEX> prepared to invade <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX>, only to be repulsed when the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> navy destroyed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spainâ€™s</ENAMEX> previously invincible <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Armada</ENAMEX>.
The defeat marked the start of a long decline. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philipâ€™s</ENAMEX> military forays and his expensive taste left <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> encumbered with debts. Participation in the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Thirty Yearsâ€™ War</ENAMEX> under <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philip III</ENAMEX> led to further financial difficulties and to another debacle in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1643</TIMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> were defeated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rocroi</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Flanders</ENAMEX>, never to regain their prestige.
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> Ascendancy
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spainâ€™s</ENAMEX> internal affairs became the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> of the other great <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">powers</ENAMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles II</ENAMEX> died without an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heir</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Habsburg Archduke Charles</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Austria</ENAMEX> challenged <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Franceâ</ENAMEX>€™s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philip</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bourbon</ENAMEX> in the ensuing <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">War of the Spanish Succession</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gibraltar</ENAMEX> was the scene of some fierce fighting in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1704</TIMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Great Britain</ENAMEX> captured the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Rock</ENAMEX> on behalf of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Austria</ENAMEX>. Under the terms of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Treaty</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Utrecht</ENAMEX>, which also confirmed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philipâ</ENAMEX>€™s right to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> throne, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> was finally forced to relinquish its claims to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gibraltar</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1713</TIMEX>.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Nearly a hundred years later</TIMEX>, during the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Napoleonic Wars</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX> fought alongside the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">fleet</ENAMEX> against <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lord</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nelson</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cape Trafalgar</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46</NUMEX>). But as the wars continued, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Napoleon</ENAMEX>, distrustful of his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ally</ENAMEX>, forced the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferdinand VII</ENAMEX> to abdicate in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1808</TIMEX>, and imposed his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph</ENAMEX>, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX>. He then sent <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> across the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pyrenees</ENAMEX> to subjugate the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX>, who promptly revolted.
Aided by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX>, who were subsequently commanded by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Duke</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wellington</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> drove the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iberian Peninsula</ENAMEX>. At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tarifa</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enemy</ENAMEX> was defeated literally overnight in an offensive of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1811</TIMEX>. What the world now knows as the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Peninsular War</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1808â€“ 1814</ENAMEX>) is in fact referred to in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> as the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">War</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Independence</ENAMEX>. During this troubled period, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spainâ</ENAMEX>€™s <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, short-lived, constitution was drafted, and their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South America</ENAMEX> won their independence.
Troubled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX>
Ferdinandâ€™s return to the throne in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1814</TIMEX> destroyed any hopes left for a constitutional monarchy, while tension between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">liberals</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conservatives</ENAMEX> led to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a century</TIMEX> of conflict, marked by the upheavals of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carlist</ENAMEX> wars and the abortive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Republic</ENAMEX>, which was proclaimed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1873</TIMEX>.
On the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">AndalucÃ­an</ENAMEX> coast, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th century</TIMEX> was a time of tentative expansion. With piracy at an end, a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> grew up along the shoreline, and the extension of the railway line to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AlmerÃ</ENAMEX>­a in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1899</TIMEX> promoted the early development of the eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alfonso XIII</ENAMEX>, just <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16 years old</TIMEX>, assumed the crown in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1902</TIMEX>. Prosperity and stability continued to elude the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, which remained neutral during <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">I. Against</ENAMEX> a murky background of violence, strikes, and regional strife, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX> accepted the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">dictatorship</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">General</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miguel Primo de Rivera</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1923</TIMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Seven years later</TIMEX>, the opposition of radical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> toppled <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Primo de Rivera</ENAMEX> from power. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alfonso XIII</ENAMEX> went into exile following anti-royalist election results in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1931</TIMEX>, and another <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">republic</ENAMEX> was founded.
Parliamentary elections in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1933</TIMEX> resulted in a swing to the right, and public opinion became polarized. When the left came out on top in the elections of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1936</TIMEX>, the situation deteriorated at an alarming rate. It came as no surprise when, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six months later</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">General</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francisco Franco</ENAMEX> led a large section of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX> against the socialist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>. Support for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Franco</ENAMEX>-led <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nationalist</ENAMEX> uprising came from monarchists, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conservatives</ENAMEX>, and the right-wing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Falangist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>, as well as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roman Catholic Church</ENAMEX>, while <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">liberals</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">socialists</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Communists</ENAMEX>, and anarchists sided with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>.
The bloodshed lasted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">no less than three years</TIMEX> and cost <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds of thousands</NUMEX> of lives. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Franco</ENAMEX> emerged as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> of a shattered <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> went into exile; others simply disappeared. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mayor</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Mijas</ENAMEX> caused a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sensation</ENAMEX> when he finally surfaced in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s</TIMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three decades</TIMEX> in hidingÂ â€”Â in his own home. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Franco</ENAMEX> kept <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> out of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX>, despite <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hitlerâ</ENAMEX>€™s entreaties to the contrary. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> gradually healed its wounds, though conditions in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> were difficult and life was far from easy.
Changing Fortunes
All that was to change, virtually overnight, as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spainâ€™s</ENAMEX> tourist potential began to be exploited in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1950s</TIMEX>. Credit was made available for the development of hotel <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> and apartment <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">blocks</ENAMEX>, and former fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Torremolinos</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marbella</ENAMEX> began to change forever. Spainâ€™s admission to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Nations</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1955</TIMEX>, followed by the advent of jet travel and package holidays in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s</TIMEX>, subsequently opened up the coast to mass tourism.
With the death of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Franco</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1975</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> returned to democracy. In accordance with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francoâ€™s</ENAMEX> wishes, the monarchy was restored in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Juan Carlos</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandson</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alfonso XIII</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>). More than just a figurehead, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX> helped to thwart a military coup in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1981</TIMEX>, keeping <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> firmly on a democratic course.
A process of decentralization was started, with more powers being devolved, although not equally, to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> semiautonomous regions. As a consequence, on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28 February 1982</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AndalucÃ­a</ENAMEX> was proclaimed an autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. Also <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that year</TIMEX>, the socialist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Felipe GonzÃ¡lez</ENAMEX> was elected and committed itself to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spainâ</ENAMEX>€™s successful integration into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Community</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX>), now known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Union</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX>. As a precondition of admission, the border with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gibraltar</ENAMEX> was reopened in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February 1985</TIMEX>, after a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16-year</TIMEX> hiatus, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> was finally admitted to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</TIMEX>. Despite high unemployment figures and separatist rumblings, the countryâ€™s economy has remained one of the fastest growing in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Western Europe</ENAMEX>.
