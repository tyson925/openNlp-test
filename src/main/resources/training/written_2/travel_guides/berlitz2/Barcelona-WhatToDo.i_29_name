What to Do
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shopping</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barcelona</ENAMEX> is at least <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madrid‚</ENAMEX>Äôs equal as a shopping capital. As a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of eminent style and taste, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barcelona</ENAMEX> abounds in fashion <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boutiques</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antiques</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">art galleries</ENAMEX>. Design is taken very seriously here. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shopping</ENAMEX> is also extremely pleasant in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barcelona</ENAMEX>, as the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> hasn‚Äôt yet been overtaken by large look-alike <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">malls</ENAMEX> and homogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Euro</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catalonia</ENAMEX> still thrives on family-owned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, and window shopping along the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rambla de Catalunya</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Passeig de Gr√</ENAMEX>†cia is a delight. Remember that with the exception of the big department <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX>, most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> are closed <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">between 1:30 or 2pm</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5pm</TIMEX>, and stay open until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8pm</TIMEX> or later. Many smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> also close <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoons</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sundays</TIMEX>.
The best items to look for include fashionable clothing, shoes, and leather products; antiques; books (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barcelona</ENAMEX> is the publishing capital of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>); high-tech design, home furnishings, and objets d‚Äôart; and music. 
In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eixample, Passeig de Gr√†cia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rambla de Catalunya</ENAMEX> are great window-shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>, with some of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barcelona‚</ENAMEX>Äôs finest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boutiques</ENAMEX> for fashion, jewelry, and home design. The nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> Mallorca, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Valencia</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Proven√</ENAMEX>ßa are also overflowing with interesting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avda</ENAMEX>. Diagonal, which cuts across <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barcelona</ENAMEX>, has some of the finest and most expensive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barcelona.</ENAMEX> It‚Äôs where to go if your tastes run to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Armani</ENAMEX> and your wallet can catch up. 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">area</ENAMEX> near <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Las Ramblas</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Gothic Quarter</ENAMEX> are also excellent spots for shopping. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pla√ßa de Catalunya</ENAMEX>, the entrance to the old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, is the jumping-off point for some of its principal shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avda</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Portal de l‚ÄôAngel</ENAMEX> and carrer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Portaferrisa</ENAMEX> are always swarming with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shoppers</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Rambla</ENAMEX> itself relies on a heavy tourist trade in trinkets, such as bullfight posters plastered with your name as the featured <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">matador</ENAMEX>, leather (or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plastic</ENAMEX>) wineskins called botas, and their glass relative, the porr√≥n; imitation <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toledo</ENAMEX> steel with the engraving painted on; imitation dueling <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pistols</ENAMEX>; and tawdry sex-shop toys. Still, you don‚Äôt have to look too hard to find succulent pastry <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> and creative jewelry <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX>. 
Department <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">El Corte Ingl√©s</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spain‚</ENAMEX>Äôs thriving version of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marks & Spencer</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harrods</ENAMEX>. It seems to stock everything for all potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> and occasions, though it can be uncomfortably crowded. There are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branches</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pla√ßa Catalunya, Portal</ENAMEX> d‚ÄôAngel, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avda</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diagonal</ENAMEX> near the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Princesa Sof√≠a Hotel</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> FNAC has installed a large, modern, and efficient <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pla√ßa Catalunya</ENAMEX> and probably has the city‚Äôs best selection of national and foreign music, including listening <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stations</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La I‚Äôlla</ENAMEX>, also on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avda</ENAMEX>. Diagonal, is one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barcelona‚</ENAMEX>Äôs best <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">malls</ENAMEX>. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Old Port</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maremagnum</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mall</ENAMEX> teeming with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>. It‚Äôs open until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11pm every day of the year</TIMEX>.
Deep in the ciutat vella (old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>) are some of the best spots for antiques. Troll for finds along the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> Banys Nous, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">carrer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de la Palla</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Petritxol in the Gothic Quarter</ENAMEX>, home to innumerable antiques <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX>. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eixample, Bulevar dels Antiquaris</ENAMEX>, a storefront at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Passeig de Gr√†cia</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">57</TIMEX>, conceals a maze of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX>-odd <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">antiques</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX>, and there are several individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">antiques shops</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">c/ Mallorca</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Valencia</ENAMEX>.
For art purchases, areas worth exploring are <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Consell de Cent</ENAMEX>, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eixample; Passeig del Born</ENAMEX>, becoming a hot new gallery area; and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> around the contemporary art <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MACBA</ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Raval</ENAMEX>, where other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">galleries</ENAMEX> are quickly springing up. There are also <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">galleries</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">c/ Petritxol</ENAMEX>, near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pla√ßa del Pi</ENAMEX>, and carrer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Montcada</ENAMEX>, clustered around the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Picasso Museum</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">You‚Äôll</ENAMEX> also find a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">galleries</ENAMEX> specializing in reproductions here. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ceramics</ENAMEX>, ranging from traditional tiles, plates, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pitchers</ENAMEX>, and bowls in white glaze with blue-and-yellow decoration, to much more modern creations, can be found in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> around the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">cathedral</ENAMEX> and along carrer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montcada</ENAMEX>. And a huge selection of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">good-quality ceramics</ENAMEX> and handicrafts can be found at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Art Escudellers</ENAMEX> (c/ Escudellers, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23-25</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BCN</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Original</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">downstairs</ENAMEX> next to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tourism Information Office</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pla√ßa de Catalunya</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>, has a nice selection of gifts with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barcelona</ENAMEX> stamp: t-shirts, paper products, etc. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lladr√≥</ENAMEX> figurines are cheaper in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> than they are at home. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mils</ENAMEX> (on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Passeig de Gr√†cia</ENAMEX>) is one of many places to find them.
Spain‚Äôs publishing industry is headquartered in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barcelona</ENAMEX>, so it‚Äôs not hard to find a wide assortment of literature, including many titles in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> and other foreign languages. Excellent art books, books on <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> culture, cookbooks, and lots of discounted titles‚Äîmany in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">English‚Äîare</ENAMEX> found at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Happy Books</ENAMEX>, which has <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branches</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Passeig de Gr√†cia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ronda de la Universitat</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Llibrer√≠a Francesa</ENAMEX>, on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Passeig de Gr√</ENAMEX>†cia at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Proven√ßa</ENAMEX>, has many books in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>, as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, particularly travel titles. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crisol</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX>, with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rambla Catalunya</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">81</TIMEX>, is also very well stocked, as is the huge <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> department store, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FNAC</ENAMEX>, on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Pla√ßa Catalunya</ENAMEX>.
For quintessential <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Catalan</ENAMEX> design, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vin√ßon</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Passeig de Gr√†cia</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barcelona‚</ENAMEX>Äôs premiere design emporium, contains just about everything that could be considered functional and well designed. It stocks expensive lighting and funky furniture, as well as watches, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen utensils</ENAMEX>, and writing instruments. Vin√ßon is known for its whimsical display windows, an enticement if <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">you‚Äôre</ENAMEX> traveling with someone whose idea of fun is anything but shopping. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BD Ediciones de Dise√±o</ENAMEX> (c/ Mallorca, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">291-293</ENAMEX>), in a gorgeous modernista <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansion</ENAMEX> designed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dom√®nech i Montaner</ENAMEX>, deals in high-end <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Catalan</ENAMEX> design, especially furniture. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pilma</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avda</ENAMEX>. Diagonal, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">403</NUMEX>) competes with the previous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX>, although with less innate style. Another good place to have a look is the small design-oriented <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop</ENAMEX> within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museu de Textil i</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">d‚ÄôIndumentaria</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montacada</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>).
A close <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> to home furnishings in the minds of many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barcelonans</ENAMEX> is fashion design, and several important <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catalan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designers</ENAMEX> have <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barcelona.</ENAMEX> Look for cool fashions for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Antonio Mir√≥</ENAMEX> at his signature <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Consell de Cent</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">349</NUMEX>, and at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Groc</ENAMEX>, on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rambla de Catalunya</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>, at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Proven√ßa.</ENAMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Galician</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adolfo Dom√≠nguez</ENAMEX> has <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> across <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>; his fashions are slightly more mainstream. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barcelona</ENAMEX>, there are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branches</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Passeig de Gr√†cia</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Avda</ENAMEX>. Diagonal, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">570</NUMEX>; and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Passeig de Gr√†cia</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">89</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Loewe</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Passeig de Gr√†cia</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX>) is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spain‚</ENAMEX>Äôs premier upscale leather goods <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX>. Before you spend your money here, consider that its display windows defaced <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Casa Lle√≥ Morera</ENAMEX>, the classic modernista <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> in which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX> is housed. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gonzalo Comella</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Passeig de Gr√†cia</ENAMEX>) sells the designs of several labels, including <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mir√≥</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Armani</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ermenegildo Zegna</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bulevard Rosa</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avda</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diagonal; Passeig de Gr√</ENAMEX>†cia next to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bulevar dels Antiquaris</ENAMEX>; and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">c/ Mallorca</ENAMEX>) has a number of excellent clothing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Polo</ENAMEX> (a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop</ENAMEX>, not affiliated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ralph Lauren</ENAMEX>). For much more affordable, but still trendy clothes, you can‚Äôt go wrong with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zara</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> that might be the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Gap</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Banana Republic</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rambla de Catalunya</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arag√≥; Av</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Portal de l‚ÄôAngel</ENAMEX>). 
For <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foodstuffs</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colmado Qu√≠lez</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rambla de Catalunya</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">63</NUMEX>), is a classic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catalan emporium</ENAMEX>, with packaged goods, fine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wines</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cheeses</ENAMEX>, and imported <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beer</ENAMEX> in a photogenic corner <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mercat La Boquer√≠a</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX>) is the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barcelona</ENAMEX> produce, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>, and meat market that‚Äôs both an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX> and a cultural experience. It‚Äôs not to be missed. For roasted nuts, dried <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruits</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spices</ENAMEX>, the 150-year-old shop <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">E&A Gispert</ENAMEX> (c/ Sobrerers, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX>) near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Mar√≠a del Mar</ENAMEX> is a treat for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX> of your senses. For a religious experience and a history lesson with your <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foodstuffs</ENAMEX> shopping, visit <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Caelum</ENAMEX> (c/ <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de la Palla</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>), which stocks all kinds of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">products</ENAMEX> produced by monasteries around the world (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trappist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">monk</ENAMEX> beers, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">honey</ENAMEX>, candles, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cheese</ENAMEX>, etc.) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Downstairs</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cellar/tea room</ENAMEX> where ancient foundations of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">baths</ENAMEX> were uncovered and are now on view.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Barcelona‚Äôs preeminent flea</ENAMEX> market is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Els Encants</ENAMEX>, which pulsates with action <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every Monday</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Pla√ßa de les Gl√≥ries Catalanes</ENAMEX> (metro: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gl√≥ries</ENAMEX>). If your thing is stamps and coins, go to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Pla√ßa Reial</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX>, or to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sant Antoni</ENAMEX> market, which also sells records and books. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pla√ßa Sant Josep Oriol</ENAMEX> has a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekend</TIMEX> art fair with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> selling watercolors and oil paintings. 
entertainment
Spaniards have earned a reputation as consummate partiers, and while <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barcelona</ENAMEX> may not be as fanatical about <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">late nights</TIMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX>, it is still a place that really swings when the sun goes down. It has virtually every kind of nightlife diversion, from cool cabarets to live jazz, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rock</ENAMEX>, flamenco, and world beat to opera, and a thriving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX> and disco scene. At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>, some <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>, like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rambla</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Passeig de Gr√†cia</ENAMEX>, become slow-moving rivers of strollers. The main <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX> and monuments are illuminated, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> takes on a new and graceful aspect. 
The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekly</TIMEX> cultural guide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gu√≠a del Ocio</ENAMEX> contains up-to-date information on all entertainment in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barcelona</ENAMEX> (available at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newsstands</ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish</ENAMEX>), while <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barcelona Ol√©</ENAMEX>!, a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</TIMEX> guide put out by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barcelona Tourism</ENAMEX>, has information on big shows and performances.
A concert at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palau de la M√∫sica</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sant Frances de Paula</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tel</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">93/268 10 00</NUMEX>), the mondernista masterpiece, is truly a one-of-a-kind experience. It almost doesn‚Äôt matter what the performance is, but you might see anything from a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX> concert or opera <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soloist</ENAMEX> to a show by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lou Reed</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tindersticks</ENAMEX>. Barcelona‚Äôs famous opera <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gran Teatre del Liceu</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Rambla</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">51-59</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tel</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">93/412 35 32 and 93/485 99 13</NUMEX>; <www.liceubarcelona.com>), was completely gutted by fire in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 1994</TIMEX>, but, amazingly, reopened to general acclaim in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter 1999</TIMEX>. It competes with the new <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Auditori de Barcelona</ENAMEX> (c/ <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Lepant</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">150</NUMEX>), which has several venues and a myriad of classical music and other performances (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tickets</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tel</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">902/101 212</ENAMEX> or <www.obc.es>).
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> also subsidizes concerts, from rock to classical, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pla√ßa de Catalunya</ENAMEX> and neighborhood <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the best events put on in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Grec</ENAMEX>, an annual <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">festival</ENAMEX> of international dance, music, and theater. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">From the last week of June</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the first week</TIMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August</TIMEX> the cultural calendar is full of everything from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> blues to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Brazilian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samba</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">avant-garde Belgian</ENAMEX> dance (for a schedule of events and ticket information: <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tel</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">93/301 77 75</NUMEX>; <www .grecbcn.com>).</txt>=<txt><ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barcelona</ENAMEX> is hardly <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Seville</ENAMEX> when it comes to tablaos‚Äîlive flamenco performances, though a few shows target the tourist trade: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tablao Flamenco Cordob√©s</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Las Ramblas</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tel</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">93/317 66 53</NUMEX>) is the most popular and predictable, while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">El Patio Andaluz</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aribau</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">242</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tel 93/209 33 78</ENAMEX>) also puts on sevillanas, more traditional southern-style singing and dancing. There are also flamenco shows twice <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nightly</TIMEX>, except <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX>, at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">El Tablao de Carmen</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Poble Espanyol</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Montju√Øc</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arcos</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>; tel. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">93/325 68 95</NUMEX>). 
For one-stop partying among those interested more in convenience than quality, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Poble Espanyol</ENAMEX> features jazz <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clubs</ENAMEX>, flamenco performances, big-bands, theater, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">discos</ENAMEX> going strong until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4am</TIMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> classic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barcelona</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cafes</ENAMEX> that are perfect for getting started or winding down are <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Caf√© de la √ìpera</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Rambla</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">74</NUMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Els Quatre Gats</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montsi√≥</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). An excellent wine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX>, with a great list of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wines</ENAMEX>, is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">El Senyor de la Vinya</ENAMEX>, right across from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Mar√≠a del Mar</ENAMEX> church. In good weather, it and another nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX> set tables out in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plaza</ENAMEX>, which is unequaled for ambience. A cavernous bodega that became immediately popular with wine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lovers</ENAMEX> is the new but ancient-looking <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Va de Vi</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Banys Vells</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>), near the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Picasso Museum</ENAMEX>.

<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> of the hottest bar scenes are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">El Born</ENAMEX>, near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Mar√≠a del Mar</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Port Ol√≠mpic</ENAMEX> near the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hotel Arts</ENAMEX>.

A young, hip <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX> flocks to <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">chic ‚Äúdesign bars‚Äù</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drinks</ENAMEX> and dancing. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nick Havana</ENAMEX> (c/ Rossell√≥, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">208</NUMEX>) was one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pioneers</ENAMEX> of the design bar genre. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Torres de √Åvila</ENAMEX>, within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Poble Espanyol</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montju√Øc</ENAMEX>, is even more extreme, an adventurous fantasy <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">playground</ENAMEX> designed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Javier Mariscal</ENAMEX>, one of the hottest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designers</ENAMEX> of late.

If you‚Äôre lucky enough to be in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> during a festival‚Äîeither a religious or secular holiday‚Äîyou‚Äôll see the city‚Äôs different neighborhoods erupt into a carnival. Food, fireworks, music, costumes, and especially the huge papier-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">m√¢ch√© effigies</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">g√©gants</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">giants</ENAMEX>) and their comical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">companions</ENAMEX>, the cabezudos (bigheads), are essential fiesta features. Each neighborhood has its own identifying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX>. The g√©gants are <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 4 meters</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">13 feet</NUMEX>) high and elaborately dressed as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">kings</ENAMEX> and queens, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">knights</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ladies</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gentlemen</ENAMEX>, and country <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folk</ENAMEX>. Cabezudos, meanwhile, are usually oversize cartoon <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heads</ENAMEX> of well-known <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personalities</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">types</ENAMEX>. They prance about mischievously, accosting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX>.
A constant of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catalan</ENAMEX> festivals is the casteller; consisting of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> who climb each other‚Äôs shoulders to form human towers <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> high in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pla√ßa de Sant Jaume</ENAMEX>.

The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Olympics cemented Barcelona‚</ENAMEX>Äôs reputation as a sports-mad <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. Barcelonans are wild about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bar√ßa</ENAMEX>, their championship <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">football</ENAMEX> (soccer) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">club</ENAMEX>, and are avid <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fans</ENAMEX> of cycling, golf, and auto and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">motorcycle</ENAMEX> racing. But they‚Äôre also active sports <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enthusiasts</ENAMEX>, eager to escape the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> for a round of <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">golf</ENAMEX>, sailing, or skiing (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">only a couple hours</TIMEX> away in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pyrenees</ENAMEX>).

The great <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spectator</ENAMEX> sport in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barcelona</ENAMEX> is football, and a match involving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bar√ßa</ENAMEX>, one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Europe‚</ENAMEX>Äôs perennial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">champions</ENAMEX>, can bring <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barcelona</ENAMEX> to a standstill. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">F.C</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barcelona</ENAMEX> has a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">120,000</NUMEX>-seat <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stadium</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Camp Nou</ENAMEX>, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barrios Altos</ENAMEX>, northwest of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avda</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diagonal</ENAMEX>.

It‚Äôs difficult to classify bullfighting‚Äîsport or art (or neither)?‚Äîbut <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barcelona</ENAMEX> does have a bullfighting ring and corridas de toros, even if they don‚Äôt hold the imagination of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locals</ENAMEX> like they do in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX> and the south of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>. You can attend a bullfight at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Plaza de Toros Monumental</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gran V√</ENAMEX>≠a at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Passeig de Carles</ENAMEX> I), on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoons</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5pm</NUMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">spring</TIMEX> through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">autumn</TIMEX>.
