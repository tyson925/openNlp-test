Where to Go
Many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Californians</ENAMEX> would like to divide their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> new <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Southern CaliforniaÂ â€”Â corresponding</ENAMEX> to what they believe to be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> distinct frames of mind as represented by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>. In fact you will find a little bit of bothÂ<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE"> â€”Â San Franciscoâ</ENAMEX>€™s sophistication and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angelesâ</ENAMEX>€™ sunny <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">crazinessÂ â€”Â all</ENAMEX> over the place.
Our journey begins with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> and its nearby attractions and works its way down the coast to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego</ENAMEX> before heading inland to the mountains and deserts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sierra Nevada</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Death Valley</ENAMEX>. You can turn this itinerary upside down if you prefer, but either way, you should also consider making an excursion to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Vegas</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Californiaâ</ENAMEX>€™s favorite out-of-state <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">playground</ENAMEX>.
You can get to almost all these places by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bus</ENAMEX>, and air travel is quite cheap. However, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> is king, and itâ€™s difficult to enjoy the full scope of this vast and varied landscape without driving. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> is unusual for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> in that it is a walkerâ€™s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">buses</ENAMEX> and cable <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> to help you up and down the hills. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> is undeniably car <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, though it is trying to alleviate its congestion and pollution by building a light-rail <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX>. Out-of-town attractions such as the national <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX>, and especially <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Death Valley</ENAMEX>, are most easily reached by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>, although once there itâ€™s more rewarding to leave your <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicle</ENAMEX> behind and explore on foot.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">San Franciscans</ENAMEX> are quite unashamedly in love with their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>. Its natural setting, nestled in the hills around the bay, makes the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> uncommonly cozy; the zip in the air is invigorating, and even the fog that rolls in off the ocean seems more romantic than chilling. If you have a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>, one way to begin your visit is to travel along <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">49-Mile</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Drive</ENAMEX>, which provides a comprehensive tour of the main sights. Youâ€™ll need to use a good map, as the blue signposts with a white seagull in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">center</ENAMEX> can be difficult to locate. Stop off at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Twin Peaks</ENAMEX> (the road to get there starts near the southern end of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Market Street</ENAMEX>) for an excellent panoramic view of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> and the bay, then park the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>, put on a pair of comfortable walking shoes, and take to the cityâ€™s first-class <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> transport system (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">120</NUMEX>). 
Start at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX>, but the one is, of course, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Golden Gate Bridge</ENAMEX>. The name <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golden Gate</ENAMEX> was given to the cityâ€™s harbor entrance in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1846</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Captain John FrÃ©mont</ENAMEX>, but the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">mile</NUMEX>-wide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> lay unspanned until the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX>, a masterpiece of engineering by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Strauss</ENAMEX>, was completed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1937</TIMEX>. At <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,200</NUMEX> ft (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,280 m</NUMEX>), it was the worldâ€™s longest single <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">span</ENAMEX> until <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">New Yorkâ€™s Verrazano Narrows Bridge</ENAMEX> surpassed it in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1964</TIMEX>, but few would deny that it remains the most beautiful suspension <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX> in the world. It took <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four years</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$35 million</NUMEX> to build; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 40 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicles</ENAMEX> now cross over the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">span</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every year</TIMEX>. You can take a bus to the bridge entrance and then walk <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acrossÂ â€”Â itâ€™s</ENAMEX> just as exciting an urban <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adventure</ENAMEX> as climbing up the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Eiffel Tower</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Empire State Building</ENAMEX>. The bridge trembles underneath your feet, and the lamp-posts rattle as the wind whistles through swooping cables. But donâ€™t <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">worryÂ â€”Â the 746-ft-</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">227-m-</ENAMEX>) high <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">towers</ENAMEX> are well embedded in earthquake-proof foundations.
Visible in the distance is the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">San Franciscoâ€“Oakland Bay Bridge</ENAMEX>, known locally as just the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Bay Bridge</ENAMEX>. This <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">silver</ENAMEX>-gray structure swings across to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oakland</ENAMEX> via <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> suspension <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">spans</ENAMEX>, a cantilever <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">span</ENAMEX>, and a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tunnel</ENAMEX> through <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Treasure Island</ENAMEX>. Itâ€™s the bridge youâ€™ll take to go to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berkeley</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX>) and is one of the routes to the wine <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Napa</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sonoma</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41</NUMEX>).
Beneath the south end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Golden Gate</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fort Point National Historic Site</ENAMEX>, the site of the brick <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">fort</ENAMEX> built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1857</TIMEX> to protect the entrance to the harbor. You can now watch <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">surfers</ENAMEX> brave the waves here. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">fort</ENAMEX> lies within the grounds of the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,480-acre</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">597-hectare</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Presidio</ENAMEX>, a former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">army</ENAMEX> post that was converted to civilian use in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX>.
You can stroll down to the yacht harbor along <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Marina Boulevard</ENAMEX>, which fronts a mile-long walkway popular with joggers. On your way, youâ€™ll pass the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palace of Fine Arts</ENAMEX>, a restored relic of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Panamaâ€“Pacific International Exposition</ENAMEX>. The buildingâ€™s Greco-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Romanesque</ENAMEX> rotunda contrasts with the technological wizardry inside the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ExploratoriumÂ â€”Â</ENAMEX> a modern hands-on science <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> with changing exhibits that feature all kinds of natural phenomena.
The great age of sail is commemorated along the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Hyde Street Pier by the majestic</ENAMEX> lines of the square-rigged <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ship</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Balclutha</ENAMEX>, and the many other exhibits of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Maritime Museum</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> can be reached from downtown by way of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Powell-Hyde</ENAMEX> cable car line.
The other main cable car route, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Powell-Mason</ENAMEX> line, terminates at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">San Franciscoâ€™sÂ â€”Â and Californiaâ€™sÂ â€”Â most</ENAMEX> popular sights, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fishermanâ€™s Wharf</ENAMEX>. Geared more <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> toward <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> than fishing, the area offers <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a dozen</NUMEX> or more <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">seafood restaurants</ENAMEX>, as well as garish knick-knack <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> and sweatshirt emporiums. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Seafood</ENAMEX> stands line the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">wharfsideÂ â€”Â though the fish</ENAMEX> is very likely to be importedÂ â€”Â and there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ghirardelli Square</ENAMEX>, a converted red-brick former chocolate <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factory</ENAMEX> (there are good free concerts <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer weekends</TIMEX>), and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Cannery</ENAMEX>, once a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit-</ENAMEX>processing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>. The ferry to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Alcatraz</ENAMEX> leaves from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Pier 41</ENAMEX> at the east end of the wharf. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pier</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39</NUMEX> consists of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> levels of open-air shopping and snacking, an arcade, and of course the famous sea <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">lions</ENAMEX> who lounge and argue on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platforms</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all day</TIMEX> long to the delight of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowds</ENAMEX>. Just follow the barking noises.
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Alcatraz</ENAMEX>
Of the many cruises you can take on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco Bay</ENAMEX>, the most entertaining is a trip to the abandoned <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prison</ENAMEX> island of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Alcatraz</ENAMEX>. The name is a distortion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isla de Alcatraces</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pelican Island</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Park Rangers</ENAMEX> offer informative and witty self-guided audio tours around the former <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Capone</ENAMEX> as well as other convicts such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Stroud</ENAMEX>, the famous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">â€œBirdman of Alcatraz</ENAMEX>.â€
A <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">12-acre</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.8</NUMEX>-hectare) rock with no cultivable soil, all the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">earth</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">shrubs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> here had to be shipped in by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US Army</ENAMEX>, for whom it had been a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œdisciplinary barracksâ€</ENAMEX> until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1934</TIMEX>. Separated from mainland <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">11â„2 miles</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2.4 km</NUMEX>) of treacherous, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX>-cold <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, haunted by <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sharks</ENAMEX> and dangerous currents, it was the ideal location for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Americaâ</ENAMEX>€™s most notorious federal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">penitentiary</ENAMEX>. However, it proved enormously expensive to run, and was closed down in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1963</TIMEX>.
You will see what â€œmaximum security, minimum privilegeâ€ meant for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alcatrazâ</ENAMEX>€™s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inmates</ENAMEX>, each <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> alone in a tiny <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>, with <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three 20-minute</TIMEX> recreation <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">periods each day</TIMEX>. There were <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">â€œluxuriesâ€Â â€”Â hot</ENAMEX> showers so that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inmates</ENAMEX> would be unable to acclimatize themselves to cold <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> and survive the chilly waters of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco Bay</ENAMEX>, as well as remarkably good <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inmate</ENAMEX> returning for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">guided tourÂ â€”Â surprisingly</ENAMEX>, some do, out of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nostalgiaÂ â€”Â said the food</ENAMEX> was better than he had eaten in many <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prisoners</ENAMEX> named the cell rows after elegant <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">New Yorkâ€™s Park Avenue</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">L.A.â€™s Sunset Boulevard</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michigan Avenue</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gangster</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Caponeâ</ENAMEX>€™s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> was on â€œBâ€ <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Block</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2nd</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">tier</ENAMEX>, number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hills</ENAMEX>
There are around <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> of them, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">theyâ€™re steepÂ â€”Â itâ</ENAMEX>€™s been said that if you get tired walking around <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> you can just lean against itÂ â€”Â but you donâ€™t have to tackle them all on foot. A tour of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Nob Hill</ENAMEX> (from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Street</ENAMEX> or by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Powell-Hyde</ENAMEX> cable <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Telegraph Hill</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bus</ENAMEX>), and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hill</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Powell-Hyde</ENAMEX> cable <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>) will give you a good sense of the past and present splendors of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Franciscoâ€™s</ENAMEX> more wealthy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX>.
The cable <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> were installed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1873</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British-born</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrew Hallidie</ENAMEX>; one of the originals can still be seen in the fascinating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cable Car Barn</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mason</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>, which is also the systemâ€™s working <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">powerhouse</ENAMEX>. The hand-made <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> are the cityâ€™s best-loved attraction, and the system was declared a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">National Historic Landmark</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1964</TIMEX>.
The monumental Victorian <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Nob HillÂ â€”Â home of the â€œnobs</ENAMEX>,â€ possibly a derivation of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">â€œnabobsâ€Â â€”Â burned down</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">1906 earthquake</ENAMEX>, and only the imposing brownstone <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Flood</ENAMEX>, now the very exclusive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pacific Union Club</ENAMEX>, survived. Sadly, you wonâ€™t be able to get in, but you can loiter (with appropriate decorum) in the areaâ€™s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">landmark hotels</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fairmont</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mark Hopkins</ENAMEX>, both at the top of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Street</ENAMEX>. The panoramic view from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Crown Room</ENAMEX> or the Top of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark</ENAMEX> is well worth the stiff price of a drink.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grace Cathedral</ENAMEX>, at the corner of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jones</ENAMEX>, is not an especially happy neo-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Gothic</ENAMEX> effort, but it is worth a look in passing for its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ghiberti doorsÂ â€”Â bronze</ENAMEX> reproductions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Baptistery East Doors</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">FlorenceÂ â€”Â</ENAMEX> a remarkable example of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Franciscoâ</ENAMEX>€™s continuing romance with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. You may also be impressed by the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> stained-glass windows dedicated to <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">â€œHuman Endeavorâ</ENAMEX>€ depicting, among others, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albert Einstein</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Lloyd Wright</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Franklin D. Roosevelt</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Ford</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Russian Hill</ENAMEX> is less opulent than <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nob Hill</ENAMEX>, but the gardens and immaculate little <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cottages</ENAMEX> of this fashionable residential area make it far more appealing. 
The roller-coaster dips and crests of the cityâ€™s hills, breaking up the monotony of the standard grid system of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>, reach a crazy climax on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lombard Street</ENAMEX> between <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hyde</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leavenworth</ENAMEX>. After youâ€™ve negotiated all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> hairpin <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bends</ENAMEX> lined with gardens of hydrangeas, youâ€™re not going to quibble about the claim that itâ€™s the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">â€œcrookedest street</ENAMEX> in the world.â€ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">blocks</ENAMEX> south is <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Filbert Street</ENAMEX>, boasting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">steepest slopeÂ â€”Â a</ENAMEX> stomach-churning <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">31.5 percent</NUMEX> gradient, with no bends.
It is worth climbing to the top of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Telegraph Hill</ENAMEX> for the view of the bay from the top of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Coit Tower</ENAMEX>, built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1934</TIMEX> to honor the cityâ€™s fire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Franciscoâ</ENAMEX>€™s many landmarks, its shape is not meant to resemble the nozzle of a fire hose, as is so often reported. Inside you will find <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Socialist Realist</ENAMEX> murals depicting â€œLife in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1934.â</NUMEX>€ Take a look at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cottages</ENAMEX> and gardens around the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greenwich</ENAMEX> Steps, clinging to the steep slope overlooking the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bayÂ â€”Â this</ENAMEX> is one of the cityâ€™s most desirable addresses.
Downtown
Market Street forms the main axis of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Franciscoâ€™s</ENAMEX> city <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>, and halfway along, at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Powell Street</ENAMEX> cable car terminus, is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">San Francisco Visitors Information Center</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">123</NUMEX>), where you can pick up a free map before you set off to explore the surrounding area.
A few blocks along <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Powell Street</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Union Square</ENAMEX>, the heart of downtownâ€™s shopping and theater district. Here you can browse in specialty <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, fashionable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boutiques</ENAMEX>, and department <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX>, such as the famous <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Macyâ€™s</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Head</ENAMEX> down to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montgomery Street</ENAMEX>, the heart of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Franciscoâ€™s</ENAMEX> financial district, also known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">â€œWall Street</ENAMEX> of the West.â€ This area was founded on the profits of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1849</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Gold Rush</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>), and is now bristling with skyscrapers of chrome and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glass</ENAMEX>. Take a look at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Old Coin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gold Exhibit</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bank of California</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Street</ENAMEX>), with its collection of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX> coins and currency, or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wells Fargo History Room</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wells Fargo Bank</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">420</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montgomery Street</ENAMEX>), which displays <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Gold Rush</ENAMEX> memorabilia, including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the original <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wells Fargo</ENAMEX> stagecoaches. Youâ€™re not likely to miss the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transamerica Pyramid</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">853-ft-</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">256-m-</ENAMEX>) tall <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> with a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">212</NUMEX>-ft (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">64-m</NUMEX>) spike, at the corner of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montgomery</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>. Itâ€™s one of those <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">purists</ENAMEX> start off hating because it clashes with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œspiritâ€</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX>, and then defend in the next generation as the very epitome of its age. If itâ€™s time for lunch or dinner, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Belden Alley</ENAMEX> (between <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pine</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kearny</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montgomery</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>), where youâ€™ll find an entire block of excellent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, all with outdoor seating
Walk the few blocks uphill to Grant Street and suddenly youâ€™re in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chinatown</ENAMEX>. This compact district has evolved from a ghetto (imposed on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th century</TIMEX> by the cityâ€™s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founders</ENAMEX>) into a local economic and political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX>. There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 150,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> living in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, making it the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>-largest <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> outside of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Yorkâ</ENAMEX>€™s is <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chinatown</ENAMEX> is bounded by <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Broadway</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kearny</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Stockton</ENAMEX>, with the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> blocks along <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Grant Avenue</ENAMEX> making up its colorful <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>.
At the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> Street end of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grant Avenue</ENAMEX>, you will enter Chinatown through the ornamental <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Chinatown Gate</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, and street signs all have an <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> translation beside the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> for the benefit of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX>, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX>, travel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>, and law <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> donâ€™t always make the same concession. Not that you wonâ€™t see the influence of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> culture in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX> such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catholic St. Maryâ€™s Chinese School</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clay</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Stockton</ENAMEX>, or in the neo-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gothic Old St. Maryâ€™s Church</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Portsmouth Square</ENAMEX>, between <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clay</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>, was the cityâ€™s original town <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam Brannan</ENAMEX> announced the discovery of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1848</TIMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>). But what really grabs your attention is the chatter of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> voices, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowds</ENAMEX>, the color, the smells of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>-spice and dried <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">shrimpÂ â€”Â itâ€™s</ENAMEX> a little corner of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> right in the middle of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>.
At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbus Avenue</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Chinatown</ENAMEX> spills over into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Beach</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Little Italy</ENAMEX> of cafÃ©s, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bakeries</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, grocery <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>. This lively neighborhood, the center of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX>, was once the focus of the cityâ€™s intellectual and artistic life. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">From the days</TIMEX> when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawrence Ferlinghetti</ENAMEX> gathered fellow <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Beats around his City Lights Bookstore</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1950s</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Beach</ENAMEX> has been a hangout for the bohemian literary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX>. City <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Lights</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">261</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbus Avenue</ENAMEX>; open <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> until <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midnight</TIMEX>) opened in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1953</TIMEX> and was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Americaâ€™s</ENAMEX> first paperback <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bookshop</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Itâ€™s</ENAMEX> still going strong <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>.
Once youâ€™ve bought your copy of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">On the Road</ENAMEX>, cross <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Kerouac Street</ENAMEX> and settle down with your purchase over a drink at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vesuvioâ€™s</ENAMEX>, another famous literary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hangout</ENAMEX>. Or if itâ€™s a sunny <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX>, buy a sandwich from a delicatessen and enjoy a picnic on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Washington Square</ENAMEX>, a splash of green overlooked by the white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spires</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Church of Saints Peter</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marilyn Monroe</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe DiMaggio</ENAMEX> were married in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1954</TIMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">area</ENAMEX> around the south end of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbus Avenue</ENAMEX> was once known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Barbary Coast</ENAMEX>, a seedy and boisterous waterfront district, with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sailors</ENAMEX> on shore leave haunting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX> and brothels, while their captains shanghaied drunken <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> to make up lost <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crew</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Barbary Coast</ENAMEX> was burned down after the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Great Earthquake of 1906</ENAMEX>, but its tawdry tradition lives on in the (now ever-dwindling) number of topless bars and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">strip clubs</ENAMEX> along <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Broadway</ENAMEX>.
Rather more highbrow entertainment is on offer in the angle between <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Market Street</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Van Ness Avenue</ENAMEX>, where there is a sprawling <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> of municipal, state, and federal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> known collectively as the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Civic Center</ENAMEX>. It was initiated during a burst of city planning after the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">1906 earthquake</ENAMEX>, and the early <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">structuresÂ â€”Â note</ENAMEX> especially the black-and-gold-domed, recently renovated <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">City HallÂ â€”Â form</ENAMEX> the finest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grouping</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> Renaissanceâ€“style architecture in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Opposite City Hall</ENAMEX> are the twin <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">faÃ§ades</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Veteransâ€™ Building</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">War Memorial Opera House</ENAMEX>, where, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1945</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Nations Charter</ENAMEX> was signed; plus the curved glass front of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louise M. Davies Symphony Hall</ENAMEX>, home of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">San Francisco Symphony Orchestra</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">district</ENAMEX> to the south of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Market Street</ENAMEX> was once an area of slums, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">warehouses</ENAMEX>, and railroad <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">yards</ENAMEX>, but redevelopment combined with low rents have gentrified the area. SoMa, as it is known (short for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South of Market</ENAMEX>), is now home to the lovely <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yerba Buena Gardens</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Moscone Convention Center</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> Metreon entertainment/shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">San Francisco Museum of Modern Art</ENAMEX>. The surrounding <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> have become the focus for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, nightlife, and many an Internet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">start-up</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golden Gate Park</ENAMEX>
Escape from the downtown skyscrapers by taking the number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fulton</ENAMEX> Street bus to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Golden Gate Park</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> was once a wasteland of sand dunes and scrub, but it was then transformed into lush parkland by the efforts of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John McLaren</ENAMEX>, the park <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">superintendent</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50 years</TIMEX>, until his death in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1943</TIMEX>.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> is a delightful landscape of woods, rhododendron groves, small lakes, and hills, with an arboretum, botanic gardens, sports <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">fields</ENAMEX>, bicycle routes, riding stables, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">buffalo paddock</ENAMEX>, and hiking <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">trails</ENAMEX>. At the eastern end thereâ€™s a wonderful childrenâ€™s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">playground</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Conservatory</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Flowers</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Victorian</ENAMEX> glasshouse from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> that remains in disrepair after a particularly violent storm <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few years ago</TIMEX>.
Beyond the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> lies the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Haight-Ashbury</ENAMEX> neighborhood, famous as the scene of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s â</TIMEX>€œSummer of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Love</ENAMEX>,â€ when <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of flower-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> flocked into the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> you are more likely to spot <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">yuppies</ENAMEX> than hippies shopping in the clothing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boutiques</ENAMEX> and record <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX>, although a number of homeless <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youth</ENAMEX> and posturing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teens</ENAMEX> hang out on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sidewalks</ENAMEX> seeking spare change. For a guided tour of the high points, check out the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2-hour</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Haight-Ashbury Flower Power Walking Tour</ENAMEX> offered <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesdays</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturdays</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:30am</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tel</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">415/221-8442</ENAMEX>).
Situated within the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX> clustered around the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Music Concourse</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M. H. de Young Memorial Museum</ENAMEX> has an impressive selection of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">African Art</ENAMEX> and of works by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Titian</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Greco</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rembrandt</ENAMEX>. However, it is better known for its outstanding collection of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">North American</ENAMEX> art from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1670 to the 20th century</TIMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asian Art Museum</ENAMEX> next door exhibits <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 10,000</NUMEX> magnificent art treasures, donated to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1966</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avery Brundage</ENAMEX>; it will relocate to the old public <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> building in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>. Across the way you will find the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">California Academy of Sciences</ENAMEX>, housing an excellent natural history <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>, an aquarium, and a planetarium.
The western end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> boasts <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two turn-of-the-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">windmills</ENAMEX> that overlook the surf at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ocean Beach</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Chilly water</ENAMEX> and dangerous currents make this more a beach for strollers, sunbathers, and experienced surfersÂ â€”Â swimming is sternly discouraged. The northern end of the beach is overlooked by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cliff House</ENAMEX>. The present <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> was built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1909</TIMEX> and now <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses restaurants</ENAMEX> serving breakfast, lunch, and dinner (the food isnâ€™t highly recommended), a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drinks</ENAMEX> at sunset are a better idea), and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MusÃ©e MÃ©canique</ENAMEX>, one of the largest privately owned collections of old-fashioned coin-operated arcade novelties in the world. Admission is free, but a pocketful of quarters will be useful. There is also a fine view of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Seal Rocks</ENAMEX> and, on a clear day, you can see as far as the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Farallon Islands</ENAMEX>, lying <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">30 miles</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">48 km</NUMEX>) offshore.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bay Area</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beyond</ENAMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">City of San Francisco</ENAMEX> covers <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only about 46 square miles</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">119 sq km</NUMEX>) at the tip of its peninsula, but its suburbs and satellite <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX>, with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">6 million</NUMEX>, spread all around the bay.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bay Area</ENAMEX> (as it is known) includes the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Peninsula</ENAMEX> to the south, with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Palo Alto</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Jose</ENAMEX> (the computer industry heartland of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Silicon Valley</ENAMEX> and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX>- largest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>); the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Bay</ENAMEX>, across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Bay Bridge</ENAMEX>, which includes <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oakland</ENAMEX> and the university <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berkeley</ENAMEX>; and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Marin County</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Franciscoâ</ENAMEX>€™s wealthiest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">suburb</ENAMEX>, with its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">mountains</ENAMEX>, forests, and pretty <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX>. Further north lie the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX>-growing regions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Napa</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sonoma</ENAMEX> valleys.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Marin County</ENAMEX>
Immediately north of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> charming waterfront <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">townsÂ â€”Â Sausalito</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TiburonÂ â€”Â</ENAMEX> which you can reach either by driving across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Golden Gate Bridge</ENAMEX> or by taking a ferryÂ â€”Â from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Ferry Building</ENAMEX> at the foot of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Market Street</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pier 41</ENAMEX> near <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Fishermanâ€™s Wharf</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tiburon</ENAMEX> is the quieter of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>, while <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sausalito</ENAMEX> is more of a tourist trap, but both have a colorful <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX> atmosphere, with art <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">galleries</ENAMEX>, yacht <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">harbors</ENAMEX>, craft <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, and pleasant <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bistros</ENAMEX> and cafÃ©s out on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boardwalk</ENAMEX> overlooking the bay.
Farther inland is the woodsy residential paradise of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mill Valley</ENAMEX>, and behind it rises the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,604</NUMEX>-ft (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">794-m</ENAMEX>) summit of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mount Tamalpais</ENAMEX>. The mountain bike was invented here in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1970s</TIMEX>, and there are plenty of hiking and biking <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">trails</ENAMEX>, but if youâ€™re feeling lazy you can drive along the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Panoramic Highway</ENAMEX> to within <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a few hundred yards</NUMEX> of the summit. The view from the top is memorableÂ â€”Â across the bay to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> and then beyond to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mount Diablo</ENAMEX>, and on a clear day you might even catch a glimpse of the beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sierra Nevada</ENAMEX> mountains.
Highway <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> twists through the hills to the coast, past the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Muir Woods National Monument</ENAMEX>, named after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Muir</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Scots</ENAMEX>-born <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">environmentalist</ENAMEX>, who founded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Californiaâ</ENAMEX>€™s conservation movement at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the turn of the 19th century</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> protects several groves of magnificent coastal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">redwoods</ENAMEX>, some of which are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250</NUMEX> ft (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">76</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX>) tall and over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1,000 years old</TIMEX>. Hiking <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">trails</ENAMEX> wind among the giant <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">highway</ENAMEX> continues on to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Point Reyes National Seashore</ENAMEX>, a large wilderness <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> on the coast, complete with beautiful rolling hills, sandy bays, and exciting wild surf. Find maps and hiking recommendations at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bear Valley Visitor Center</ENAMEX>. Explore the bird-haunted lagoon at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Drakeâ€™s Bay</ENAMEX>, a peaceful cove where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis Drake</ENAMEX> claimed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1579</TIMEX>, or hike your way through the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Earthquake Trail</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">path</ENAMEX> that follows the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Andreas Fault</ENAMEX>. The tiny burg of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Point Reyes Station</ENAMEX> across the little bridge on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Petaluma Road</ENAMEX> contains some good <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> and an excellent spot for gourmet take-out, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tomales Bay Foods</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Fourth Street</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berkeley</ENAMEX>
Take the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BART</ENAMEX> subway from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Market Street</ENAMEX> or drive across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Bay Bridge</ENAMEX> to make a pilgrimage to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of California</ENAMEX> campus at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Berkeley</ENAMEX> (pronounced <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">BIRK-lee</ENAMEX>), the scene of 1960s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> radicalism. Opened in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1873</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berkeley</ENAMEX> is the oldest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Californiaâ</ENAMEX>€™s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">campuses</ENAMEX>. Tours of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX>, gardens, and other sights are organized from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Student Union</ENAMEX> at the end of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Telegraph Avenue</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mondayâ</ENAMEX>€“Saturday at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10am</NUMEX>). The free and easy access to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">universityâ€™s facilities</ENAMEX> will give you an insight into <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Berkeleyâ€™s</ENAMEX> open personality. The nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> are lined with lively cafÃ©s and interesting bookshops. If youâ€™re driving, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> over to <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Fourth Street</ENAMEX> for good <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> and prodigious shopping and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>-watching.
Wine Country
The scenic valleys of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Napa</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sonoma</ENAMEX> have been producing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> on a commercial basis since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the middle of the 19th century</TIMEX>, and today <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wines</ENAMEX> are considered to be among the finest in the world. There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 250</NUMEX> vineyardsÂ â€”Â or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wineries</ENAMEX> as they are calledÂ â€”Â and most of them offer guided tours and tastings. Some of the more interesting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wineries</ENAMEX> to visit are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mondavi, Beringer</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sterling</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beaulieu</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Napa</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Matanzas Creek</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Benzinger</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sonoma</ENAMEX>.
You can drive to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">vineyards</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> via <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Interstate 80</ENAMEX>, across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Bay Bridge</ENAMEX>, but bus tours are also available through the major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX>. You can also arrange a custom tour, visiting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wineries</ENAMEX> of your choice, through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wine Country Jeep Tours</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tel</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">800/539-5337</TIMEX>, toll-free in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Napa Valley</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wine Train</ENAMEX> is another option for a scenic hands-off chug through the valley, including lunch or dinner, but no <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">winery</ENAMEX> visits.
A note of warning: The entire <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX>, and particularly the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Napa Valley</ENAMEX>, is inundated with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all year</TIMEX> round, especially on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekends</TIMEX>. You would be well advised to book lodging, dining, and even tours ahead of time.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Central Coast</ENAMEX>
Highway <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> runs for <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">400 miles</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">643 km</NUMEX>) south from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">L.A.</ENAMEX>, along a coastline of often spectacular beauty.
First stop for most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Monterey Peninsula</ENAMEX>, a wave-battered coast of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">gnarled cypress trees</ENAMEX> and jagged rocks, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">home</ENAMEX> of sea <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">lions</ENAMEX>, pelicans, and otters. The principal <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> here is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Monterey</ENAMEX>, the old <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> capital of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alta</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Upper</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Monterey Bay</ENAMEX> was discovered in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1542</TIMEX>, but it wasnâ€™t settled until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">much later</TIMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Father</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">JunÃ­pero Serra</ENAMEX> set up a mission in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1769</TIMEX>. Serraâ€™s statue looks down on the bay from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corporal Ewin Road</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> is proud of its past and offers a self-guided tour of all the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Old Townâ</ENAMEX>€™s historic <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>. Look out for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larkin House</ENAMEX>, at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jefferson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Calle Principal</ENAMEX>, home of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> (and only) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States Consul</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1840s</TIMEX>, as well as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stevenson House</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">530 Houston Street</ENAMEX>, where the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Scottish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Louis Stevenson</ENAMEX> lived for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four months</TIMEX> after his arrival in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1879</TIMEX>. Some think that the nearby coastline around <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Point Lobos</ENAMEX> provided the inspiration for the setting of his famous adventure novel, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Treasure Island</ENAMEX>.
On <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Church Street</ENAMEX> youâ€™ll find the site of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Father</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Serraâ</ENAMEX>€™s original adobe <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>. Rebuilt in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1795</TIMEX>, it is now the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Royal Presidio Chapel</ENAMEX> (or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cathedral of San</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carlos de Borromeo</ENAMEX>). By the waterfront is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Customs House Plaza</ENAMEX>, with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maritime Museum</ENAMEX>, as well as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Old Custom House</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1827</TIMEX>), where the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> flag was raised by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Commodore</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Sloat</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1846</TIMEX> when he claimed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Monterey</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>.
Beside the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Plaza</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Montereyâ€™s Fishermanâ€™s Wharf</ENAMEX>. Like <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">San Franciscoâ€™s</ENAMEX>, it is a collection of souvenir <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dock</ENAMEX>, offering a great view across the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">marina</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> on sale is most definitely fresh, but alas, no longer abundant enough to keep <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cannery</ENAMEX> Row going as more than a weather-beaten curiosity. The famous sardine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">fisheries</ENAMEX> finally closed down in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1940s</TIMEX> as a result of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-fishing, but the waterfront district of timbered canneries, immortalized by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">novelist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Steinbeck</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">â€œa poem</ENAMEX>, a stink, a grating noise, a quality of light, a tone, a habit, a nostalgia,â€ has found a new lease on life <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> as a tourist attraction with souvenir <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, delightful cozy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boutiques</ENAMEX>, and artistsâ€™ <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">studios</ENAMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cannery building</ENAMEX> has been splendidly converted to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Monterey Bay Aquarium</ENAMEX>, one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">premier</ENAMEX> aquariums in the world as well as an educational showcase for the unique underwater environment of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Monterey Bay</ENAMEX>. The centerpiece is the stunning 30-ft- (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10-m-</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">deep Kelp Forest Tank</ENAMEX>, a window on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Californiaâ</ENAMEX>€™s most important marine habitat. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Kids</ENAMEX> will love the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sea Otter Pool</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Touch Pools</ENAMEX>, where they can both handle and learn about sea anemones, crabs, and even bat rays.
The <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">17-Mile</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Drive</ENAMEX> is a lovely scenic toll <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> starting at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lighthouse Avenue</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Grove</ENAMEX>, a pleasant waterside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of Victorian <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> and clapboard <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cottages</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a few miles</NUMEX> beyond <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Monterey</ENAMEX>. The drive passes through beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cypress groves</ENAMEX> along a wild and rocky coastline, where you can watch <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX>, otters, and sea <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">lions</ENAMEX> in the wild, before passing through the famous golf <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pebble Beach</ENAMEX> and finally reaching the exclusive resort <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Carmel</ENAMEX>-by-the-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sea</ENAMEX>, famous for once having <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clint Eastwood</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mayor</ENAMEX>. It is a quaint, picture-postcard <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> full of kitschy <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cottages</ENAMEX>, with narrow, tree-lined <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> crammed with expensive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">art galleries</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">craft</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>. At the foot of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ocean Avenue</ENAMEX> lies the beautiful white <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sand</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Carmel Beach</ENAMEX>, backed by shady pines and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">cypress trees</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Southeast</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> is the peaceful <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Carmel Mission</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Father</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">JunÃ­pero Serra</ENAMEX> himself lies buried.
At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Point Lobos State Reserve</ENAMEX> you can hike right down to the oceanâ€™s edge. Watch especially for the playful sea otters, which can often be seen floating on their backs munching on a juicy abalone or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>. From <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December to March</TIMEX>, look out also for pods of migrating gray <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">whales</ENAMEX>.
The coastal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">highway</ENAMEX> south from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Carmel</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Sur</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only 30 miles</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">48 km</NUMEX>) long, but it takes <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">more than an hour</TIMEX> of careful driving. Squeezed in between the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Santa Lucia mountains</ENAMEX>, the road twists and turns along a quite narrow ledge hacked out high above the pounding surf, with spectacular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridges</ENAMEX> spanning the deep canyons.
The numerous state <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX> along the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Big Sur</ENAMEX> coast offer marvelous opportunities for outdoor activities like camping, hiking, and fishing. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Miller</ENAMEX> made his home here during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1950s and 60s</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> continue to live in cabins in the woods and canyons.
At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nepenthe</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Orson Welles</ENAMEX> built a honeymoon cottage for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rita Hayworth</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the days</TIMEX> when film <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stars</ENAMEX> did the romantic things expected of them by their adoring public. Now it has been expanded and converted into a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX>, well worth a visit for its incomparable view of the ocean.
The rugged coast continues south for another <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">65 miles</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">105 km</NUMEX>) along to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Simeon</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Randolph Hearst</ENAMEX>, the newspaper <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">magnate</ENAMEX> immortalized by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Orson Welles</ENAMEX> in the film <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Citizen Kane</ENAMEX>, built his unbelievable dream <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> on a hilltop high above the sea. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hearst Castle</ENAMEX> now forms the centerpiece of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hearst</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Simeon State Historical Monument</ENAMEX>, and is one of the most popular attractions in all <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> (guided tours only). Allow at least <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two hours</TIMEX> for a tourÂ â€”Â you can book one at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Visitor Center</ENAMEX>, but itâ€™s advisable to make an advance reservation, especially during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX>, by phoning <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Destinet</ENAMEX> at (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">800</ENAMEX>) <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">444-4445</TIMEX>; group tours (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">800</ENAMEX>) <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">401-4775</TIMEX> (both toll-free in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX>).
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Randolph Hearst</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1863â€“1951</ENAMEX>) was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">millionaire</ENAMEX> newspaper <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baron</ENAMEX>. He began building this grandiose retreat in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1919</TIMEX> on a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ranch</ENAMEX> that he had inherited from his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>, who made his fortune mining <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nevadaâ€™s Comstock Lode</ENAMEX>. It was still not completed by the time of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hearstâ</ENAMEX>€™s death in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1951</TIMEX>. Here he entertained the movie <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">star</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marion Davies</ENAMEX>, his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mistress</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30 years</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">famous guests</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charlie Chaplin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scott</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zelda Fitzgerald</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greta Garbo</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Winston Churchill</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Lindbergh</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">photographer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herman Mankiewicz</ENAMEX>, who recorded life at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Simeon</ENAMEX> for posterity.
You approach <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hearst Castle</ENAMEX> on a tour <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bus</ENAMEX> that climbs the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 miles</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">8 km</NUMEX>) from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Visitor Center</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">hilltop</ENAMEX>, passing through the parkland that was once <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hearstâ</ENAMEX>€™s private <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">zoo</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Â The lions</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkeys</ENAMEX>, cheetahs, kangaroos, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">polar bears</ENAMEX> are long gone, but zebra, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">goats</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Barbary sheep</ENAMEX> can still be seen.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Julia Morgan</ENAMEX> built the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œcastleâ€</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hearstâ</ENAMEX>€™s specifications as a showcase for his extraordinary collection of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> art. The truly mind-boggling variety of that collection begins to register as you pass the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">104</NUMEX>-ft- (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">32-m-</NUMEX>) long <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> mosaic swimming pool, complete with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colonnade</ENAMEX> and a copy of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Donatelloâ€™s Florentine</ENAMEX> statue of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David</ENAMEX>.
The main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> and its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> surrounding guest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>, with their terraces and gardens, is a fantasy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">concoction</ENAMEX> derived from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gothic</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baroque</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> styles, with both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fake</ENAMEX> and original artwork thrown together. Genuine <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tilework</ENAMEX> sits beside locally made copies; a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> sarcophagus and a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3,500-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Egyptian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">goddess</ENAMEX> are both authentic, but the castleâ€™s faÃ§ade, with its equestrian friezes on the balcony and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gothic</ENAMEX>-style canopies, is made almost completely of reinforced concrete. Above the huge main door, in quiet simplicity, sits a genuine <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madonna</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Child</ENAMEX>.
Inside the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX>, the hodgepodge of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">periods</TIMEX> and styles runs riot. The dining <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> has a magnificent cedarwood coffered ceiling from a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bologna</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monastery</ENAMEX>, and is decorated with the flags from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sienna</ENAMEX> palio pageant. At the table set for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guests</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hearstâ</ENAMEX>€™s dilettantism is emphasized by the sight of splendid, solid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">silver</ENAMEX> Queen <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anne</ENAMEX> candlesticks and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine cisterns</ENAMEX>, which are set beside tomato <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ketchup</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pickles</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mustard</ENAMEX>, all in their original bottles and jars.
Beyond <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Simeon</ENAMEX> the rugged coastline begins to relent, and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">farms</ENAMEX> and oil <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rigs</ENAMEX> take the place of crags and canyons. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rural Route 1</ENAMEX> joins the multi-lane <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Highway 101</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">San Luis Obispo</ENAMEX> for the final leg to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>, but <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">places</ENAMEX> are worth a detour from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">freeway</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lompoc</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Route 135</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Route 1</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Maria</ENAMEX>) sits prettily among the fields of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> that have made it the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">â€œFlower-Growing Capital of the World</ENAMEX>.â€ On the edge of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La PurÃ­sima Mission</ENAMEX>, founded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1787</TIMEX> and rebuilt in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1813</TIMEX> after an earthquake. It is the most extensively and authentically restored of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Californiaâ</ENAMEX>€™s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Franciscan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">missions</ENAMEX>, and the old pink-and-white adobe walls provide a haven of peace amid the former living and working <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">quarters</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">missionaries</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Native Americans</ENAMEX>. The garden is full of olive and mulberry <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">livestock</ENAMEX> such as burros, turkeys, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-horned churro sheep all contribute to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">1820s</NUMEX> atmosphere.
When you get to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Barbara</ENAMEX> you know for sure that youâ€™ve arrived in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southern California</ENAMEX>. Its palm-fringed <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>, red-tile <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pavements</ENAMEX>, and low-rise <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish Revival</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> spread up the hillsides from the beautiful beach, oozing sun-tanned health and the scent of money. Itâ€™s a favorite weekend retreat for many of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angelesâ</ENAMEX>€™ wealthier <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX>.
On <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">State Street</ENAMEX>, which runs from the beach up through the center of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, youâ€™ll find a thriving downtown filled with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">theaters</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>. In particular, take a peek at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Arlington Theater</ENAMEX>; the inside was designed to mimic a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX>-style <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">dusk</TIMEX>, including a star-filled sky. Thereâ€™s history on display, too, at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mission Santa Barbara</ENAMEX> (corner of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Laguna</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mission</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>). The mission, which was founded on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 1786</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Feast</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. Barbara</ENAMEX>, offers a self-guided tour of its restored <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> and outbuildings. Also worth a visit is the beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santa Barbara County CourthouseÂ</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE"> â€”Â a magnificent Spanish</ENAMEX>-Moorishâ€“style edifice dating from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1927</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> is the quintessential <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">city</ENAMEX>. Only modern technology could have turned this former patch of desert into one of the worldâ€™s most flourishing metropolises.
A combination of engineering <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genius</ENAMEX> and shady business deals brought water <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">hundreds of miles</NUMEX> across <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">mountains</ENAMEX> and desert to slake the cityâ€™s thirst and nurture its lush gardens and palm <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>. An abundance of space then allowed the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> to sprawl, but distance was no <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">problemÂ â€”Â cheap oil</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> produced a vast freeway <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">system</ENAMEX>, which links the coast, the hills, and the farthest-flung valleys in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> huge metropolitan region. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Visitors</ENAMEX> flying into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">L.A.</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> get a grand view of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> of traffic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">arteries</ENAMEX>, with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trucks</ENAMEX> surging along like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood corpuscles</ENAMEX> pumping through the veins of some living <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L.A.</ENAMEX> covers such an immense area that the first-time <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitor</ENAMEX> can easily feel overwhelmed. The best way to approach the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> is to break it down into smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> and then take them one at a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">timeÂ â€”Â Downtown</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Westside</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Coast</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valleys</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Orange County</ENAMEX>.
Downtown
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L.A.â€™s</ENAMEX> downtown commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">district</ENAMEX> is steadily becoming a more attractive and culturally active area, but the activity here diminishes once the workday is over. Surrounded by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">freeways</ENAMEX> and the river, historically this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">district</ENAMEX> is the heart of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Itâ€™s</ENAMEX> now also the terminus of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">L.A.</ENAMEX>â€™s new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metro Rail</ENAMEX> system, which is housed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Spanish Missionâ</ENAMEX>€“style <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Union Station</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Pueblo de</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Los Angeles State Historic Park</ENAMEX> preserves a few blocks of the original <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> around which the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> grew up. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Olvera Street</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a bustling</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">marketplace</ENAMEX> lined with colorful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">handicraft</ENAMEX> and food <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stalls</ENAMEX> and historic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>, including the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avila Adobe</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">L.A.</ENAMEX>â€™s <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>, dating from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1818</TIMEX>. Half of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Californiaâ€™s Mexican</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> (chicano) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> lives in central <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>, but youâ€™ll find the full range of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cityâ€™s ethnic populationÂ â€”Â represented</ENAMEX> by comestiblesÂ<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC"> â€”Â at Grand Central Market</ENAMEX>, north of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Pershing Square</ENAMEX>.
Just north of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pueblo</ENAMEX> are the crowded <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Oriental</ENAMEX> architecture of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">L.A.â€™s Chinatown</ENAMEX>, while to the south is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Little Tokyo</ENAMEX>, the cultural <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Village Plaza</ENAMEX> is a popular shopping spot, with twisting paths lined with bonsai <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>, rock gardens, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sushi bars</ENAMEX>. Nearby is a monument to the space shuttle <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Challenger</ENAMEX>, including a statue of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese-American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">astronaut</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ellison Onizuka</ENAMEX>, one of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> who died in the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">1986</ENAMEX> disaster.
The most dynamic area of downtown is the commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">district</ENAMEX> around <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Flower Street</ENAMEX>; many of the new cultural <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX> that have surfaced in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX> are located here. The beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum of Contemporary Art</ENAMEX> (MOCA) at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">California Plaza</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">South Grand Avenue</ENAMEX>) is a striking setting for important works by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Piet Mondrian</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Rauschenberg</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackson Pollock</ENAMEX>, as well as many other innovative <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MOCA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">curators</ENAMEX> keep <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> step ahead of the pack by commissioning new work, which is then displayed beside contemporary classics. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Geffen Contemporary</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">152</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North Central Avenue</ENAMEX>) is an annex to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MOCA</ENAMEX> a few blocks away in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Little Toyko</ENAMEX>, focusing on film and performing arts.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Music Center</ENAMEX>, at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Street</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grand</ENAMEX>, is an important <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">L.A.</ENAMEX> venue for concerts and plays, which are performed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dorothy Chandler Pavilion</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mark Taper Forum</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ahmanson Theater</ENAMEX>. Tours of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Centerâ</ENAMEX>€™s architecture and sculpture are available.
<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">A few miles</NUMEX> southwest of central downtown, next to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Southern California</ENAMEX> campus, lies <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Exposition Park</ENAMEX>, the setting for the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1932</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Olympics</ENAMEX>. Of special note is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Natural History Museum</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">900 Exposition Boulevard</ENAMEX>) with its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>-geared <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Discovery Center</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">California Museum of Science and Industry</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">700 State Drive</ENAMEX>), which features technological exhibits.
If youâ€™re heading west from downtown, avoid the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">freeway</ENAMEX> and follow another great <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">thoroughfare</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Wilshire Boulevard</ENAMEX>. Once an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">trail</ENAMEX>, in its heyday this <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">16-mile</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">25-km</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roadway</ENAMEX> glittered with the prosperity of its department <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> and luxury <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX>. A living <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Art Deco</ENAMEX> architecture that characterized <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angelesâ</ENAMEX>€™s rise to greatness during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1920s and 1930s</TIMEX>, the section of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wilshire</ENAMEX> between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">La Brea</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fairfax</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">avenues</ENAMEX>, known as the â€œmiracle <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">mile</NUMEX>,â€ is slowly being renovated after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> of neglect. Notable <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> include the former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bullocks Wilshire</ENAMEX> department store standing at the corner of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kingsley</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Franklin Life Insurance</ENAMEX> building situated at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Van Ness</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wilshire</ENAMEX>.
The primary reason to cruise along <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wilshire</ENAMEX> is to arrive at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hancock Park</ENAMEX>, home of the famous <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">La Brea Tar Pits</ENAMEX>. Here petroleum deposits ooze through fractures to the surface and evaporate, leaving natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tar lakes</ENAMEX> (brea is <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">â€œtarâ€</ENAMEX>). From viewing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stations</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> may observe the excavation of fossilized remains. The adjacent <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George C. Page Museum</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5801</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Wilshire Boulevard</ENAMEX>) has on display the skeletons of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mammoths</ENAMEX>, mastodons, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">saber-toothed tigers</ENAMEX>, and other unfortunate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">creatures</ENAMEX> who became trapped in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sticky tar</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last Ice Age</TIMEX>.
Next door to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tar</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pits</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los Angeles County Museum of Art</ENAMEX> (LACMA), whose provocative modern architecture houses <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the stateâ€™s best art collections, including outstanding examples of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nepalese</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Tibetan</ENAMEX> art, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> scroll paintings, pre-Columbian art, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> Expressionist drawings. Other highlights include important works by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rembrandt, DÃ¼rer</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frans Hals</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Picasso</ENAMEX>, and the Impressionists.
Motoring aficionados should drive another <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> blocks to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Petersen Automotive Museum</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6060</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Wilshire Boulevard</ENAMEX>), which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> the largest collection of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">motorcycles</ENAMEX>, and related memorabilia in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX>
The actual <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX> has not lived up to the idea of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX> for quite some time. In fact, itâ€™s a somewhat seedy <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">area</ENAMEX> still surviving on its outdated reputation. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Tourists</ENAMEX> continue to flock to landmarks made famous over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</TIMEX>, but donâ€™t make the trek expecting to see anyone associated with the film business. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">studios</ENAMEX> themselves have long since moved over the hills to set up shop in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Hollywood</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Burbank</ENAMEX>, and everyone else is busy cutting deals over in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beverly Hills</ENAMEX>.
Along <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hollywood Boulevard</ENAMEX> youâ€™ll find <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 2,500</NUMEX> actorsâ€™ names on bronze stars embedded in the pavementÂ<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC"> â€”Â the Walk of Fame</ENAMEX>. Youâ€™ll pass <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Frederickâ</ENAMEX>€™s of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX>, with its lingerie <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>, and the beautifully restored <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel</ENAMEX>, site of the first public <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oscar</ENAMEX> ceremony. Between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">La Brea</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Western Avenue</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">boulevard</ENAMEX> exhibits the fine, tacky splendor of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1920s and 30s</TIMEX>, with its low, flat stucco <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>, a droopy palm <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>, and even some vintage <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Packards</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buicks</ENAMEX> parked out on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>. While the neighborhood is less than scintillating, the second-hand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bookstores</ENAMEX> specializing in film-related books and posters are excellent.
The hand-, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">foot-</NUMEX>, and hoof-prints of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stars</ENAMEX> are immortalized in the concrete <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mannâ€™s Chinese Theater</ENAMEX> (at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6925</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hollywood Boulevard</ENAMEX>) erected in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1927</TIMEX>. Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stars</ENAMEX> were obliged to get on their knees and make a hand-print, but it was natural for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fred Astaire</ENAMEX> to leave a foot-print, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Wayne</ENAMEX> to leave a fist-print, and cowboy <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Mix</ENAMEX> to leave his horseâ€™s hoof-print.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> of freeway exits away is the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Hollywood Bowl</ENAMEX>, a splendid open-air amphitheater where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra</ENAMEX> holds concerts under the gigantic illuminated letters of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX> sign planted up in the hills.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South of Hollywood Boulevard</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">L.A.</ENAMEX>â€™s most famous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Sunset Boulevard</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">section</ENAMEX> between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beverly Hills</ENAMEX>, known simply as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">â€œThe Strip</ENAMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€</ENAMEX> continues to be the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">playground</ENAMEX> of the rich, famous, young, and hip. A drive down <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sunset</ENAMEX> can be dangerous, as the billboards touting the latest movies and records may make it difficult to keep your eyes on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>.
While youâ€™re on the north side of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, take a drive around the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood Hills</ENAMEX> for a superb view of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. The classic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> cruise is along <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Mulholland Drive</ENAMEX>. On a clear day you can see <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Long Beach</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">25-miles</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">40-km</NUMEX>) away across the vast, sprawling <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">metropolis</ENAMEX>.
Another great viewpoint is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Observatory in Griffith Park</ENAMEX> (off <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Highway 5</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Fans</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Dean</ENAMEX> will recognize the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ObservatoryÂ â€”Â it</ENAMEX> was the scene of the climax of Rebel Without a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cause</ENAMEX>. The panorama from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terrace</ENAMEX> on a clear day is fantastic, from the spiky skyscrapers of downtown to the distant <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Griffith Park</ENAMEX> is the biggest city <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. It sprawls across the eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood Hills</ENAMEX> and is criss-crossed with drives and hiking <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">trails</ENAMEX>. Toward sunset is the best time to go, just as the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> lights are coming on.
Westside
At <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Doheny Drive</ENAMEX>, the western edge of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">merges</ENAMEX> with the slopes of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Laurel Canyon</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beverly Hills</ENAMEX>, dotted with the sumptuous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansions</ENAMEX> of the movie <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">moguls</ENAMEX>. While these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> are heavily guarded and hidden from view, you can sense the opulent atmosphere as you drive through the plush, carefully manicured <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">avenues</ENAMEX>. The architecture is an astounding mixture of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gothic, Bauhaus</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX>, in every pastel shade under the sun. Donâ€™t bother slowing down for the street <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendors</ENAMEX> selling â€œofficialâ€ maps showing the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> of the rich and famousÂ â€”Â unless you get a kick out of security gates.
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Rodeo Drive</ENAMEX> (pronounced <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ro-DAY-oh</ENAMEX>) is the famous shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> (if you saw the movie <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Pretty Woman</ENAMEX>, youâ€™ve seen <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Rodeo Drive</ENAMEX>) and itâ€™s just as upscale and sophisticated as advertised. If youâ€™re visiting in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX> or around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX>, take a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">half-hour</TIMEX> guided tour on the sweet <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beverly Hills Trolley</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1</NUMEX>. Meet the trolley on the corner of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Rodeo</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Dayton WayÂ â€”Â itâ</ENAMEX>€™s the only bargain youâ€™ll find in the neighborhood.
Nearby in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Century City</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum of Tolerance</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9786</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">West Pico Boulevard</ENAMEX>) uses high technology to explore and encourage understanding between cultures. Its interactive exhibits focus on the history of racism in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>, highlighting <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beit Hashoah</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Holocaust</ENAMEX>.
Thereâ€™s a more scholarly feel to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> around the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">campus</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UCLA</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of California</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>) at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Westwood Village</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Village</ENAMEX> is a fine place in which to see a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">movieÂ â€”Â new</ENAMEX> films always open here <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>. At the edge of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Westwood</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UCLA/Armand Hammer Museum of Art</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Cultural Center</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">10899 Wilshire Boulevard</ENAMEX>) features a fabulous collection of paintings personally collected over the last <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fifty years</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Hammer</ENAMEX>. If your visit to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX> has filled you with nostalgia for the great <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> of cinema, then you might like to pay homage to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marilyn Monroe</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Westwood Memorial Park</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1212</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Glendon Avenue</ENAMEX>, south of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Wilshire Boulevard</ENAMEX>), where a modest plaque bears silent testimony to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actress</ENAMEX>.
West of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">campus</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brentwood</ENAMEX>, on a bluff high above the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">405</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">freeway</ENAMEX>, is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Getty Center</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1200</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Getty Center Drive</ENAMEX>), opened in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>. The major attraction among the impressively designed arts education and research <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J. Paul Getty Museum</ENAMEX>, which contains all the art (and more) formerly housed at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Getty Villa</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malibu</ENAMEX>. Among the paintings are superb works by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Raphael</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rubens</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">van Dyck</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rembrandt</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Visitors</ENAMEX> can also see a selection of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> antiquities housed here until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year 2001</TIMEX>, when they are scheduled move back into the newly renovated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Getty Villa</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malibu</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J. P. Getty</ENAMEX> had a coherent idea of the kind of art he wanted to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">collectÂ â€”Â Greek</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baroque</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> Rococo. His antiquities collection is impressive, highlighted by the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">â€œGetty bronze</ENAMEX>,â€ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a fourth-century</TIMEX> b.c. statue of an <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Olympic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">champion</ENAMEX>, believed by some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> to be the only remaining work of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lysippus</ENAMEX>, court sculptor of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander the Great</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coast</ENAMEX>
â€œThe beach,â€ as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locals</ENAMEX> refer to it, stretches some <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">72 miles</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">115 km</NUMEX>) from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malibu</ENAMEX>, through <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Monica</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venice</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Marina del Rey</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hermosa</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Redondo</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palos Verdes</ENAMEX>, before the white <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sands</ENAMEX> run into the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pollution</ENAMEX> around the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">San</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pedro</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Long Beach</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shipyards</ENAMEX>. Thereâ€™s no better way to get the special feel of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> than by heading right down to the beach, because in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">L.A.</ENAMEX> the beach is not just for holidays and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">weekendsÂ â€”Â itâ€™s</ENAMEX> a year-round <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">playground</ENAMEX>, community <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">center</ENAMEX>, gymnasium, solarium, and singles <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malibu</ENAMEX> is the favored <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX> of the more relaxed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywoodâ€™s</ENAMEX> film <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX>. Rather than barricade themselves behind electrified fences guarded by huge <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dobermans</ENAMEX>, as they do in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bel Air</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beverly Hills</ENAMEX>, film <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actors</ENAMEX> and hot young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX> can be seen here jogging along the seashore or simply gathering their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">groceries</ENAMEX> at the local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">supermarket</ENAMEX>.
Perhaps the most famous attraction here is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Getty Villa</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malibu</ENAMEX> (formerly the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J. Paul Getty Museum</ENAMEX>) at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17985</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Pacific Coast</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Highway</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malibu</ENAMEX>. At first the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> awaken echoes of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hearst Castle</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Simeon</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45</NUMEX>). It is undoubtedly a serious art collection, but its settingÂ â€”Â in a vast replica of a palatial <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> villaÂ â€”Â has something of the pretentious inclinations of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Simeon</ENAMEX>, without <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hearstâ€™s</ENAMEX> pick-and-mix flamboyance. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> is currently closed for renovations and will reopen in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year 2001</TIMEX> with only <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> antiquities.
Malibuâ€™s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Surfrider Beach</ENAMEX> attracts <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">surfers</ENAMEX> from all over the world as well as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locals</ENAMEX>, many riding the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">old-fashioned â€œbig gunsâ€Â â€”Â</ENAMEX> boards <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 10</NUMEX> ft (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3 m</ENAMEX>) long. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malibu Pier</ENAMEX> is a good place to fish, but sunbathing and swimming are a little more peaceful down the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Las Tunas</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Topanga</ENAMEX> beaches. The only natural hazard that can disturb <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malibuâ</ENAMEX>€™s cheerful complacency is the odd storm tide or landslide that washes the precarious beach <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> into the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific</ENAMEX>.
In contrast, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Monica</ENAMEX> is built on more solid ground, befitting the upper-middle <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class community</ENAMEX> that inhabits it. This attractive seaside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, one of the most pleasant <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">places</ENAMEX> to stay in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">L.A.</ENAMEX>, is very popular with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in the arts and entertainment industries. At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> there are many good <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clubs</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">theaters</ENAMEX> to enjoy, and by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX> there is the glorious beach, complete with an amusement <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pier</ENAMEX>, antique carousel, and the nearby shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arcades</ENAMEX>.
However, it is neighboring <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venice</ENAMEX> that attracts all the only-in-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Californians</ENAMEX>. The beach and boardwalk here are a non-stop open-air circus of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">L.A.</ENAMEX>â€™s extroverts and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">eccentrics</ENAMEX>, all vying with each other to be the center of attention. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1892</TIMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">millionaire</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abbot Kinney</ENAMEX>, planned construction of a replica of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venice</ENAMEX> here, but shortly after work started, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> was discovered and the idea was abandoned. The neighborhood has now been revived as a diverse <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX>, and bohemian types. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venice</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> are among those who have pioneered the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>-painting that has spread throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">L.A.</ENAMEX>Â<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL"> â€”Â the trompe lâ</ENAMEX>€™oeil murals covering whole faÃ§ades, often <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three or four</NUMEX> stories high, some creating optical illusions by depicting mirror images of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> on which they appear.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South</ENAMEX> of the more staid <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Marina del Rey</ENAMEX>, the worldâ€™s largest small-boat <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">harbor</ENAMEX>, the beaches continue in an unbroken golden <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">curveÂ â€”Â Dockweiler</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manhattan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hermosa, RedondoÂ</ENAMEX> â€”Â to the rocky bluffs of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palos Verdes</ENAMEX>. Around the point lies <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">San</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pedro</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Port of Los Angeles</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Long Beach</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Long BeachÂ â€”Â which</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">7 miles</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">11 km</NUMEX>) long, in factÂ â€”Â is the last resting place of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the worldâ€™s biggest ever cruise <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Queen Mary</ENAMEX>, a nostalgic reminder of the grand era of luxury ocean liners. Since being moored here in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1967</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Queen Maryâ</ENAMEX>€™s staterooms have been turned into a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX>, and her dining <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> into a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX>; the rest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ship</ENAMEX> is open to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> with self-<ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">guided tours</ENAMEX> (admission is free). Launched on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">River Clyde</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Scotland</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1936</TIMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cunard</ENAMEX> line, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Queen Mary</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,019 ft</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">310 m</ENAMEX>) long, displaces <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">81,237 tons</NUMEX>, and carried a complement of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,174</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crew</ENAMEX>, with accommodation for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,959</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX>.

The Valleys
The great mass of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angelesâ</ENAMEX>€™s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> lives in the sprawling suburbs of the valleysÂ â€”Â the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Fernando Valley</ENAMEX> north of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood Hills</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">San Gabriel Valley stretching</ENAMEX> east towards <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Bernardino</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Itâ€™s</ENAMEX> composed mainly of suburbs and uninspired <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">strip centers</ENAMEX> (block-long low-rise shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">malls</ENAMEX>), but there are a few reasons to drop by.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the most enjoyable is a tour of the film and television <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">studios</ENAMEX> located in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Fernando Valley</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> major TV networksÂ<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL"> â€”Â CBS</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NBCÂ â€”Â</ENAMEX> welcome you onto their sets for a look behind the scenes at some of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Americaâ</ENAMEX>€™s most popular TV shows. A limited number of tickets to live shows are available. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Universal Studios</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX>, just north of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hollywood Freeway</ENAMEX> (either the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Universal Center Drive</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lankershim Boulevard exits</ENAMEX>), offers an elaborate tour in open trams. In the course of displays of special-effects trickery youâ€™ll be attacked by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">shark</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jaws</ENAMEX>, meet up with a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">three-story-</NUMEX>tall <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">King Kong</ENAMEX>, and be subjected to all the earthquakes, floods, and fires you ever saw in a disaster movie. You can also take a look behind the scenes and learn about techniques that are used to create filmâ€™s great illusions. The highlight is the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Back To The Future</ENAMEX> ride. Seated in a flight <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">simulator</ENAMEX> shaped like the famous time-traveling <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">DeLorean</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> in the films, you will be taken on a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hair-raising</ENAMEX> chase through time and space.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner Brothers</ENAMEX> is located just off the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Ventura Freeway</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4000</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner Boulevard</ENAMEX>). It organizes tours for smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> around the special effects and prop <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">departments</ENAMEX> and the back-lotsÂ â€”Â even during the shooting of a film, if youâ€™re lucky.
In the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">San Gabriel Valley</ENAMEX> east of downtown, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pasadena</ENAMEX> is one of the oldest and richest suburbs, home to the renowned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">California Institute of Technology</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cal Tech</ENAMEX>) and the handsome, modern <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norton Simon Museum</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">411</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Colorado Boulevard</ENAMEX>), just off the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Ventura Freeway</ENAMEX>. This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> houses a truly remarkable range of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> paintings, drawings, and sculpture from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early Renaissance to the 20th century</TIMEX>, along with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bronzes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stone carvings</ENAMEX>. Outstanding attractions are works by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Raphael, Botticelli, Rembrandt</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rubens</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CÃ©zanne.</ENAMEX> You will also find an extensive collection of drawings by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Picasso</ENAMEX> and, one of the museumâ€™s great joys, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Degas</ENAMEX> bronzes. The sculpture garden includes works by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maillol</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Picasso</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rodin, Giacometti</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Moore</ENAMEX>.
The neighboring <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">suburb</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">San Marino</ENAMEX> was once owned by railroad <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tycoon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry E. Huntington</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1850â€“1927</ENAMEX>), and his fine <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansion</ENAMEX> now houses the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Huntington Library</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1151</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxford Road</ENAMEX>). Its collection of rare books includes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Folios</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Gutenberg Bible</ENAMEX>, and a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> edition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Benjamin Franklinâ</ENAMEX>€™s autobiography. The most seductive attraction is perhaps the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">130-acre</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">50-hectare</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Botanical Garden</ENAMEX>, with its magnificent <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rose</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Desert</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> gardens.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Orange County</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Orange County</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bedrock</ENAMEX> of conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southern California</ENAMEX>, is the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">birthplace</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ex-president</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Nixon</ENAMEX>, and land of the lawn sprinkler, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-car <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garage</ENAMEX>, and the â€œplanned <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX>.â€ Along the coast, however, you can rediscover the beach culture that gave birth to the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Beach Boys</ENAMEX>, and at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Anaheim</ENAMEX> you can indulge yourself in the delights of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Californiaâ</ENAMEX>€™s number-one tourist attraction.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Anaheim</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">27 miles</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">43 km</NUMEX>) southeast of downtown <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">L.A.</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Ana</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Freeway</ENAMEX>, is the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">home</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Disneyland</ENAMEX>. Itâ€™s best to allow a full day for a visit, as the entrance fee is expensive and there is so much to see. You can buy a Passport for one, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>, or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three days</TIMEX>, covering the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Disneyland</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> and valid for unlimited use on all the attractions. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Food</ENAMEX> and drink are not included in the admission price.
Main Street sets the tone with its sunny evocation of small-town <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">USA</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the turn of the century</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> are all three-quarter sizeÂ â€”Â in his effort to escape from the realities of the outside world, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Disney</ENAMEX> made everything a little smaller than in real life. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Adventureland</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> trip through simulated jungle on a river that makes its way through <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Pacific</ENAMEX>. A miniature <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">railroad</ENAMEX> carries you through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Frontierland</ENAMEX>, the pioneer <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Old West</ENAMEX>, where loudspeakers warn you to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â</NUMEX>€œwatch out for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indians</ENAMEX> and wild <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>.â€
Tomorrowland, one of the most exciting theme lands, is constantly being renovated to keep pace with technological progress. The various rides include a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">submarine</ENAMEX>, a spaceship bound for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mars</ENAMEX>, and up-to-date experiments in public transport. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> new attractions are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mickeyâ€™s ToonTown</ENAMEX>, a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3-dimensional</TIMEX>, living cartoon world, as well as Fantasmic!, an after-dark light-and-sound spectacular where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heroes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">villains</ENAMEX> clash inside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mickeyâ</ENAMEX>€™s imagination.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest of Disneyland</ENAMEX> you will find the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Movieland Wax Museum</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">7711 Beach Boulevard</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Buena Park</ENAMEX>), which displays wax figures of film stars in scenes from their best-known films. For film <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buffs</ENAMEX>, the most interesting display will be the collection of old nickelodeons, autoscopes, and movieola machines that projected the very first moving pictures.
Just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">block</ENAMEX> south of the wax <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> yet another kind of fantasy can be experienced at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Knottâ€™s Berry Farm</ENAMEX>, where the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">American Wild West</ENAMEX> is brought to life in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> different theme-park areas. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wild West Ghost Town</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White Water Rapids Ride</ENAMEX>, loop-the-loop roller coaster, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Good Time Theater</ENAMEX> will keep the entire family entertained for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> on end. If you feel a little peckish after all that action, you can feast on the boysenberry <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pies</ENAMEX> and chicken dinners with which Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Knott</ENAMEX> started up her business over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50 years ago</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego</ENAMEX>
This is where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Californiaâ€™s</ENAMEX> recorded history began when, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1542</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Juan RodrÃ­guez Cabrillo</ENAMEX> stepped ashore at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Point Loma</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>). Today, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Americaâ</ENAMEX>€™s <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">seventh</NUMEX>-largest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, home to a major naval <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base</ENAMEX>, and has been voted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Americaâ</ENAMEX>€™s most desirable <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> in which to live. The climate is perfect, the beaches are beautiful, the revitalized downtown area is lively, and the number and range of activities for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of all ages is impressive.
The modern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city center</ENAMEX> contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> blocks of preserved Victorian <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">buildingsÂ â€”Â  the Gaslamp Quarter</ENAMEX>. Here you can stroll along the red-brick pavements and admire the charming restored architecture from the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">turn-of-the-century</TIMEX> while you browse among the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">galleries</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bars</ENAMEX>. This section of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> is particularly busy on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">nights</TIMEX>, when the young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locals</ENAMEX> jam the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sidewalks</ENAMEX> and fill the many cafÃ© tables.
At the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Broadway Street</ENAMEX> edge of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gaslamp Quarter</ENAMEX>, you canâ€™t miss <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Horton Plaza</ENAMEX>, one of the best modern shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">malls</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. Along with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floors</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, open-air terraces, and quirky decorations, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> will find the local half-price ticket <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">booth</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times Arts Tix</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tel</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">619/497-5000</ENAMEX>). Broadway ends at the harbor, where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> can visit one of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several 19th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX> moored on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Embarcadero</ENAMEX> and belonging to the excellent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maritime Museum</ENAMEX>.
The cityâ€™s pride and joy is the iron-hulled square-rigger <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Star of India</ENAMEX>, built in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Isle of Man</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1863</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Star</ENAMEX> is the oldest sailing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ship</ENAMEX> that is still seaworthy; she makes a celebratory cruise twice <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each summer</TIMEX>. A brief walk along the waterfront leads to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Seaport Village</ENAMEX>, a lively complex of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">galleries</ENAMEX> overlooking the harbor.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the best ways to appreciate <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diegoâ</ENAMEX>€™s sparkling beauty is from the sea. You can take a cruise along the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bayÂ â€”Â boat</ENAMEX> trips leave from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Harbor Drive</ENAMEX>, just south of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Maritime MuseumÂ â€”Â out</ENAMEX> past the man-made <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Harbor</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shelter Islands</ENAMEX> and around the tip of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Coronado</ENAMEX> peninsula (occupied by a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">US Naval Air StationÂ â€”Â the film Top Gun</ENAMEX> was set nearby in northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego</ENAMEX>) to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Point Loma</ENAMEX> out on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific</ENAMEX> coast. The seemingly endless procession of fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX>, yachts, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US Navy</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels makes</ENAMEX> for a fascinating tour.
The superb <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,200-acre</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">462-hectare</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Balboa Park</ENAMEX> is situated northeast of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Horton Plaza</ENAMEX> just up <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">6th Avenue</ENAMEX>.

The highlight of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">San Diego Zoo</ENAMEX>, one of the finest in the world. Established in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1922</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">zoo</ENAMEX> was a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pioneer</ENAMEX> in the use of moats, ravines, rocks, and embankments rather than bars and cages, giving the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> as large, free, and natural a living space as possible. It is famous for its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sumatran</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">tigers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Malaysian</ENAMEX> sun bears as well as a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX> of koala <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bearsÂ â€”Â the</ENAMEX> only breeding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> outside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australia</ENAMEX>. You can enjoy a birdâ€™s-eye view of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">zoo</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Skyfari</ENAMEX> aerial tramway, or take a guided tour <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bus</ENAMEX>. An extension of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">zoo</ENAMEX> is located <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">30 miles</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">48 km</NUMEX>) north at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Wild Animal Park</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Escondido</ENAMEX>, where <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,500</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, including zebra, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">lions</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">elephants</ENAMEX>, cheetahs, and rhinoceros, roam freely.
The oldest part of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego</ENAMEX> is situated <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 miles</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4.8 km</NUMEX>) north of downtown in the area known as <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Old Town</ENAMEX> (bounded by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Juan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Twiggs</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wallace</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>). Here, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1769</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> colonization of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> commenced, beginning with the construction of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Father</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">JunÃ</ENAMEX>­pero <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Serraâ€™s Mission San Diego de Alcala</ENAMEX>. In this area of restored <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">adobe buildings</ENAMEX>, you can enjoy a rest under the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">palms</ENAMEX> and eucalyptus of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Plaza Vieja</ENAMEX> (originally the town <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plaza</ENAMEX> and bullfight arena before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yankees</ENAMEX> arrived), browse among the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stalls</ENAMEX> selling <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> handicrafts, or eat at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Cabrillo National Monument</ENAMEX>, situated on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Point Loma</ENAMEX> promontory (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">I-5/I-8</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">exit</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Rosecrans Street</ENAMEX> and follow the signs), celebrates the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who discovered <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Diego Bay</ENAMEX>. You can walk the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">trails</ENAMEX> around the point, visit the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Old Point Loma Lighthouse</ENAMEX>, and at low tide explore the tide <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pools</ENAMEX> for crabs, starfish, anemone, and, if you are lucky, perhaps even the odd, elusive <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">octopus</ENAMEX>. If <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youâ€™re</ENAMEX> here <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between December</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX>, watch for migrating gray <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">whales</ENAMEX> from the look-out point near the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">lighthouse</ENAMEX>.
Other aquatic pursuits can be enjoyed at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mission Bay</ENAMEX>, a first-class <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">watersports center</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bay</ENAMEX> is also home of the famous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sea World</ENAMEX> marine <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>, where youâ€™ll be able to watch performing <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">two-ton</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">killer whales</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Children</ENAMEX> especially will enjoy the antics of the trained <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dolphins</ENAMEX>, sea <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">lions</ENAMEX>, and otters.
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">San Diegoâ</ENAMEX>€™s beaches are truly beautiful and remarkably unspoiled, stretching for some <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">27 miles</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">43 km</NUMEX>) up to the elegant suburb of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">La Jolla</ENAMEX> (pronounced <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">â€œla HOY-a</ENAMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">â€ Spanish</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">â€œjewelâ€</ENAMEX>), whose <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centerpiece</ENAMEX> is the tiny rock basin of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Jolla Cove</ENAMEX>. The rocky coast to the south is marvelous for walking, and away from the ocean there are stylish <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> and elegant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> to visit. The marine life of southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> is splendidly displayed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Birch Aquarium</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scripps</ENAMEX>, which is spectacularly sited on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">hilltop</ENAMEX> above <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">La Jolla</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mountains</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deserts</ENAMEX>
If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Californiaâ</ENAMEX>€™s great outdoors is a religion, then its cathedrals are found in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yosemite</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sequoia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Kings Canyon</ENAMEX> national <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX>, as well as the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Death Valley National Park</ENAMEX>. In these magnificent stretches of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">wildernessÂ â€”Â the</ENAMEX> mountains of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sierra Nevada</ENAMEX>, the huge, silent <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">redwood forests</ENAMEX>, and the awe-inspiring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emptiness</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">desertÂ â€”Â you</ENAMEX> can begin to recapture the adventurous spirit of the earliest <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> experience. These <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX> are, naturally, immensely popular with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Californians</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> alike, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yosemite</ENAMEX> more so than the others, but they all have ample room for everyone to escape the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowds</ENAMEX>.
Certain regulations must be observed within the national <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX>. There are strict speed limits, usually lower than on normal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">highways</ENAMEX>. It is forbidden to feed or otherwise interfere with the wild <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, and it is essential that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> storage regulations are followed in any <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX> where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bears</ENAMEX> are found. Hunting is illegal and you are required to have a state license to fish. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Hikers intending</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camp</ENAMEX> in the back <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> must first obtain a wilderness permit (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">108</NUMEX>).
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Camping</ENAMEX> is allowed only in designated campsites, and fires are restricted to certain areas. None of the regulations is a real burden, however, as there are excellent public campsites, picnic areas, and barbecue <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> to be found in all the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yosemite National Park</ENAMEX>
The scenic <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Yosemite Valley</ENAMEX> is a perfect example of a glacier-carved canyon, with its sheer granite walls 3,200ft (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">975m</NUMEX>) high plunging to a flat floor of woods and wild-flower meadows, enclosing the waters of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Merced River</ENAMEX>. Your <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œbase campâ</ENAMEX>€ could be a plush hotel <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>, more modest lodge accommodation, or even just a tent. From the valley meadows you can hike, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bike</ENAMEX> (rentals at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yosemite Lodge</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Curry Village</ENAMEX>), or take the shuttle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bus</ENAMEX> to all the principal sights.
You can grade the hikes according to your fitness and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">experienceÂ â€”Â if</ENAMEX> in doubt, seek advice at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Visitor CenterÂ â€”Â but</ENAMEX> try <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> walk, in sturdy shoes, for the sheer exhilaration of making it to the end. The <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">11â„2-mile</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2.4-km</NUMEX>) round-trip trail from <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Happy Isles</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vernal Falls</ENAMEX> is within the scope of any reasonably fit and healthy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>, following a well-marked path through the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">pine trees</ENAMEX>, with easy gradients. The brilliant light and intoxicatingly clean air on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">trail</ENAMEX> are a true delight, and the thundering falls, at their best during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the spring</TIMEX> snow melt, are awe-inspiring.
If youâ€™re feeling up to it, push on along the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Mist Trail</ENAMEX>, past <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Emerald Pool</ENAMEX>, to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nevada Fall</ENAMEX>, and youâ€™ll begin to lose the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowds</ENAMEX>. Here youâ€™re on part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">John Muir Trail</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39</NUMEX>), which heads past <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Merced Lake</ENAMEX> and on to the lovely <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tuolumne Meadows</ENAMEX> up in the high country. The final destination of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">John Muir Trail</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mount Whitney</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">more than 200 miles</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">322 km</NUMEX>) away.
Less exhausting is a drive or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">shuttle-bus</ENAMEX> ride past <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Badger Pass</ENAMEX> (good skiing slopes in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX>) to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Glacier PointÂ â€”Â</ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY"> 7,214 ft</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2,200 m</NUMEX>) above sea level. The view over the whole valley and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">High Sierras</ENAMEX> beyond is breathtaking, as is the other way to get <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hereÂ â€”Â a</ENAMEX> steep hike up the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX><NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">-Mile</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Trail</ENAMEX>.
You can see <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yosemite Creek</ENAMEX> drop down <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">half a mile</NUMEX> from the opposite wall in the spectacular <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Upper</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Middle</ENAMEX>, and Lower <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yosemite Falls</ENAMEX>, and youâ€™ll get an outstanding view of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">majestic Half Dome</ENAMEX>, a granite <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monolith</ENAMEX> sliced in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> by the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ice Age</TIMEX> glaciers. From here you may feel like leaving the bus and hiking back down to the valley, along the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Panorama Trail</ENAMEX> via the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nevada</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vernal Falls</ENAMEX>, a trip of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">8 miles</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">13 km</NUMEX>), most of it downhill!
A beautiful and easy hike goes out to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mirror Meadow</ENAMEX>, tucked in underneath the vertical northwest face of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Half</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dome</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">trail</ENAMEX> is especially good during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early spring</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">summer mornings</TIMEX>, when the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX> are perfectly still, capturing the most breathtaking colors from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> and the cliffs of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mount Watkins behind it.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sequoia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kings Canyon National Parks</ENAMEX>
These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX> lie adjacent to each other, and are usually visited <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">togetherÂ â€”Â one</ENAMEX> entrance fee covers both. The main attractions are their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">giant</ENAMEX> sequoias, many of them approaching <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3,000 years old</TIMEX>, and the spectacular rock scenery of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Kings Canyon</ENAMEX>. The forests offer a gorgeous array of dogwoods, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sugar</ENAMEX> pines, and white and red firs, and a rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flora</ENAMEX> of orange <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">leopard lily</ENAMEX>, lupine, bracken fern, chinquapin, and white <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">corn</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">lily</ENAMEX>.
Start at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Visitor Center</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lodgepole</ENAMEX> or Grant <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Grove</ENAMEX>, where you can pick up a map and information about the best forest walks and back-country hikes, and perhaps watch their interesting audio-visual presentations about the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX>.
The best introduction to the forest is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress Trail</ENAMEX>. Itâ€™s an easy <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2-mile</NUMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3-km</TIMEX>) walk, but worth lingering over for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a couple of hours</TIMEX> to absorb the beauty of the largest living creations in nature. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">trail</ENAMEX> begins at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">General</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sherman Tree</ENAMEX>, the biggest of them all. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Measuring 274 ft</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">84</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX>) tall, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">103 ft</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX>) around its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base</ENAMEX> and still growing, itâ€™s one of the largest living organisms in the world. Reaching up for light well above the rest of the forest, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branches</ENAMEX> start 130 ft (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX>) above the ground.
Another beautiful walk, and by no means an exhausting <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>, is out to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crescent Meadow</ENAMEX>, passing on the way such venerable <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> as the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bearâ€™s Bathtub, the Shattered Giant, and the Chimney</ENAMEX>.
The real back country is found <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">11 miles</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">18 km</NUMEX>) along the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">High Sierra Trail</ENAMEX>, beyond <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crescent Meadow</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bearpaw Meadow</ENAMEX>. The hike is not too formidable, and the meadow has a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rudimentary campsiteÂ â€”Â though spaces</ENAMEX> are limited. Within a dayâ€™s walk are a lake and streams with good fishing, especially for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">trout</ENAMEX>, and youâ€™ll have a fair chance of spotting some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">parkâ€™s wildlife</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">tooÂ â€”Â bobcats</ENAMEX>, coyotes, golden <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">eagles</ENAMEX>, black <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bear</ENAMEX>, spotted <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">skunk</ENAMEX>, and cougar.
Death <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valley National Park</ENAMEX>
Of all the wonders of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>, the high desert is perhaps the greatest surprise. The desert is no monotonous expanse of sand dunes, but a beautiful, variegated land full of color and space. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> it is a bizarre landscape of jagged rock and gravel, naked mountains and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX> lakes, baked and shimmering in the desert heat. Go in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> and you may see drifts of spring <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> blooming in the wake of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sparse rains</ENAMEX> that make it over the snow-dusted <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Panamint Mountains</ENAMEX> in the west. Unhidden by vegetation, the colors of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rocksÂ â€”Â brick red</ENAMEX>, ochre, green, and purple-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">brownÂ â€”Â are</ENAMEX> dramatically deepened at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">sunset and dawn</TIMEX>, creating unforgettable views.
Donâ€™t be put off by the name <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Death Valley</ENAMEX>. It is a legacy of the bitter hardships endured <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">by Gold Rush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hopefuls</ENAMEX> who set out to cross the desert from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arizona</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nevada</ENAMEX>. Some never made it. Todayâ€™s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">travelers</ENAMEX>, however, are well catered to, with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">motels</ENAMEX> and campsites at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Furnace Creek</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stovepipe Wells</ENAMEX>. Begin at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Furnace Creek Visitor Center</ENAMEX>, where you can pick up maps and information on the road conditions, hiking <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">trails</ENAMEX>, and general desert safety. Driving is the only way to get around, but remember that distances are great and gasoline <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stations</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">few</TIMEX> and far between. Make sure your <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> is in good mechanical condition and that the tank is full before you begin each dayâ€™s tour. Also, you would be well advised to carry spare <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, just in case the radiator boils over.
Get up at dawnÂ<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL"> â€”Â you wonâ€™t regret itÂ â€”Â and</ENAMEX> drive out to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Zabriskie Point</ENAMEX>. As the sun rises behind you, the light hits <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tucki Mountain</ENAMEX> and the tips of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Panamints</ENAMEX> to the west before plunging into the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">valleyâ€™s primeval salt</ENAMEX> lake far below. Continue to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Danteâ€™s View</ENAMEX> (altitude <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5,745 ft/1,750 m</NUMEX>), where you can look out westward to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wildrose</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bennett</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Telescope</ENAMEX> peaks. Down in the valley in front of you lies the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salty puddle</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BadwaterÂ â€”Â at 282 ft</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">86</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX>) below sea level, which is the lowest point in the western hemisphere.
The crazed and pinnacled surface of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX>-caked lake bed has earned it the nickname of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Devilâ€™s Golf Course</ENAMEX>. Take a walk out across that glaring expanse of baked <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">saltÂ â€”Â the</ENAMEX> atmosphere of desolation is almost exhilarating. If you look closer at the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX> under your feet, youâ€™ll discover that the expansion of the crystallizing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mineral</ENAMEX> has heaved it into bizarre funnels, swirls, and other intricate patterns.
On the way back toward <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Furnace Creek</ENAMEX> lies <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Artistâ€™s Drive</ENAMEX>, where the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> (one way only from south to north) carves its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">path</ENAMEX> through a canyon of multi-colored rocks, culminating in the very aptly named <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Artistâ€™s Palette</ENAMEX>. Here, oxidization has turned the rocks bright mauve, ochre, green, vermilion, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">turquoise</ENAMEX>, and purple.
Death <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Valley</ENAMEX> was an irresistible magnet for prospectors, who once scoured the hills and canyons for signs of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">copper</ENAMEX>, lead, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">silver</ENAMEX>. Thus the mountains are riddled with old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mines</ENAMEX> and exploratory shafts, but only a few of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">miners</ENAMEX> struck paydirt. You can explore the remains of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Keane Wonder Mine</ENAMEX> on the east side of the valley and the ghost <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Skidoo</ENAMEX> in the west, where <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$3 million</NUMEX> worth of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX> was dug out of the ground over a period of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</TIMEX>.
At the northern boundary of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Death Valley</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">52 miles</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">84 km</NUMEX>) from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Furnace Creek</ENAMEX>, lies the remarkable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scottyâ€™s Castle</ENAMEX>, a luxuriously furnished 1920s <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX>-style <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansion</ENAMEX> that rises improbably from the bed of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grapevine Canyon</ENAMEX>. It was built for a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">millionaire</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albert Johnson</ENAMEX>, who spent his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winters</TIMEX> prospecting for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX> with his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter Scott</ENAMEX>, known to all as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">â€œDeath Valley Scotty</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€ Guided</ENAMEX> tours take you round the lavish interior; you can wander the grounds at will. Nearby lies <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ubehebe Crater</ENAMEX>, the spectacular result of a volcanic explosion. A short trail leads to the floor of the crater.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Excursion</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Vegas</ENAMEX>
Inland from the urban jungle of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">L.A.</ENAMEX> lies the dry and desolate expanse of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mojave Desert</ENAMEX>, a vast, empty landscape that stretches <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">200 miles</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">322 km</NUMEX>) to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nevada</ENAMEX> border. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Interstate Highway</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> slashes through the desert and, before reaching the neon sprawl of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Vegas</ENAMEX>, passes through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">StatelineÂ</ENAMEX> â€”Â a smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> area with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">casinos</ENAMEX>, and a theme <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Vegas</ENAMEX> grew out of a stopover at a natural <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">oasis</ENAMEX>, which burgeoned after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nevadaâ</ENAMEX>€™s legalization of gambling in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1931</TIMEX>. Today, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> converge on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vegas</ENAMEX> from all over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>. Many are still here for a bit of fun and titillation, and to lose a few bucks at roulette or blackjack, but <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Vegas</ENAMEX> now touts itself as a family destination.
The famous focal point of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Vegas</ENAMEX> is The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Strip</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">some 4 miles</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6.5 km</NUMEX>) of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Las Vegas Boulevard</ENAMEX> crammed with huge <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">casino</ENAMEX> and hotel <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX>, as well as some of the newer <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">megaresortsÂ â€”Â</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGM Grand</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Excalibur</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Treasure Island</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Venetian</ENAMEX>, gondolas and all.
The older <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> continue to make improvements to keep up with the megaresortsÂ<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC"> â€”Â Circus Circus</ENAMEX> built <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Grand Slam Canyon</ENAMEX>, a family theme <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> sheltered within a climate-controlled pink glass <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dome</ENAMEX>. Most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> offer family amenities and shows, many of them first-class (although <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> are never allowed to loiter in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">casinos</ENAMEX>). Any show by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cirque du Soleil</ENAMEX> (at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Treasure Island</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bellagio</ENAMEX>) is worth seeingÂ â€”Â this international <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">troupe</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">performers</ENAMEX> reaches mystical heights.
If itâ€™s the traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Vegas</ENAMEX> you dream of, the best time to arrive is at sunset, when the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> lights loom out of the desert darkness. For the same reason, nighttime is the best time to roam along The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Strip</ENAMEX>, when the lights are brightest and the tables at their liveliest. Apart from the dÃ©cor, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">casinos</ENAMEX> are pretty much <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alikeÂ â€”Â admission</ENAMEX> is free, and theyâ€™re open <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours a day</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">365 days a year</TIMEX>. There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-armed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bandits</ENAMEX> (slot machines) near the doors, the delights of roulette, blackjack, craps, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Keno</ENAMEX> further in, and everywhere huge television screens showing horse-<ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">racing</ENAMEX> and other big sporting events from all over the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. For the bewildered, there are free booklets explaining how best to lose your money at the various tables, and free blackjack lessons in the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoons</TIMEX>. You will notice there are no clocks or windows in the casinosÂ â€”Â the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> wants you to lose track of time.
There are also alternatives to gamblingÂ â€”Â the big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">casinos</ENAMEX> offer live stage shows with all kinds of entertainment, from major singing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stars</ENAMEX> to leggy extravaganzas like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Folies BergÃ</ENAMEX>¨res to world-title boxing matches. If you want to get out and about, there are opportunities for almost every type of recreation activity, including <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> sports, within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an hour</TIMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>.
Look out for the numerous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">â€œwedding chapelsâ€</ENAMEX> along The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Strip</ENAMEX> where you can get married in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 10 minutes</TIMEX> for a flat <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$50</NUMEX> fee, â€œwitnesses extra,â€ then spend your neon-lit honeymoon in the conveniently adjoining motel.
