A Brief History
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> he early history of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX> is closely related to that of the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iberian</ENAMEX> peninsula. Prehistoric cultures flourished <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> in the north and in today‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alentejo</ENAMEX> region of south-central <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX>. The south was visited by a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peoples</ENAMEX> who came primarily to trade, including the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phoenicians</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mycenaean Greeks</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carthaginians</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phoenicians</ENAMEX> established a trading post at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lisbon</ENAMEX> around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1200</TIMEX> b.c, calling it either <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Alis Ubbo</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Olissipo</ENAMEX>. When <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Celtic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peoples</ENAMEX> crossed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pyrenees</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first millennium b.c.</TIMEX>, they intermarried with the existing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iberian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> and built a series of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">hilltop fort communities</ENAMEX> or cit√¢nias, the finest example of which is at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Briteiros</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">73</NUMEX>).
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carthaginians</ENAMEX>, under <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hannibal</ENAMEX>, recruited <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locals</ENAMEX> to fight as mercenaries against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Romans</ENAMEX> eventually defeated the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carthaginians</ENAMEX> and invaded the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iberian</ENAMEX> peninsula. Their occupation was fiercely opposed by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">confederation</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Celts</ENAMEX>, known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lusitani</ENAMEX>, living in central <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Lusitanian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Viriathus</ENAMEX>, kept the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> at bay until he was assassinated in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">139 b.c.</TIMEX> 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Romans</ENAMEX> cultivated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">grapes</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wheat</ENAMEX>, and olives; built <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX>; and bequeathed the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> foundations of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Portuguese</ENAMEX> language and a strong base of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> belief. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Julius Caesar</ENAMEX> founded many <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ebora (√âvora</ENAMEX>), where the remains of a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> survive (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">90</NUMEX>), and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pax Julia</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beja</ENAMEX>). 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moors</ENAMEX> and the Reconquest
In a.d. <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">711</NUMEX> a great <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX> invasion <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">fleet</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North Africa</ENAMEX> crossed the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Strait of Gibraltar</ENAMEX>. In a matter of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">only a few years</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moors</ENAMEX> had conquered almost all of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iberia</ENAMEX>, except for the small <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">kingdom</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asturias</ENAMEX> in northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lisbon</ENAMEX> became a thriving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outpost</ENAMEX> under <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX> occupation.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moors</ENAMEX> failed to penetrate much further north than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aveiro</ENAMEX> about halfway up the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic Coast</ENAMEX>. They settled in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alentejo</ENAMEX>, along the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tagus river</ENAMEX>, and in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve</ENAMEX> (which they named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al-Gharb</ENAMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>ÄúWestern <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Land‚Äù</ENAMEX>). By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-ninth century</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al-Gharb</ENAMEX> had become a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Moorish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">kingdom</ENAMEX>, with a capital at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chelb</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Silves</ENAMEX>, (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">107</NUMEX>).
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moors</ENAMEX> introduced new <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crops</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oranges</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX>, to the region. Their highly distinctive whitewashed <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> and filigree chimneys are features of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX> to this day, as are azulejos (handpainted, glazed ceramic tiles). Many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Moorish</ENAMEX> place names also survive, including that of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">F√°tima</ENAMEX>, the pre-eminent <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catholic</ENAMEX> site in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX>. Unlike their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">successors</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moors</ENAMEX> were tolerant of the many different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peoples</ENAMEX> who lived together in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berbers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arabs</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christians</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX>.
Even so, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moors</ENAMEX> were regarded as an occupying power by the local <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Christian Reconquest</ENAMEX>, which sought to drive the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslims</ENAMEX> out, was under way in the north by the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">ninth</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">century</TIMEX>. 
It was not until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1128</TIMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Dom Afonso Henr√≠ques</ENAMEX> became the Count of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Portucale</ENAMEX>, that the struggle to regain power met with any real success. Henr√≠ques consolidated his position by defeating the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moors</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Battle of Ourique</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1139</TIMEX>, and celebrated by naming himself the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX>. 
By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1185</TIMEX> the frontier between Christianity and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Islam</ENAMEX> had been drawn at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tagus</ENAMEX>. Not until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1249</TIMEX> did <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Afonso III</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1248‚Äì1279</ENAMEX>) complete the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reconquest</ENAMEX> and secure borders for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Portugal¬</ENAMEX>†‚Äî¬<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">†250 years</TIMEX> before the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> could do the same. 
Consolidation and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golden Age</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Afonso III</ENAMEX> moved his capital from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coimbra</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lisbon</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1260</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six years</TIMEX> after he had called the first <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cortes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">parliament</ENAMEX>) in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Leiria</ENAMEX>. His <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">successor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Dom Dinis</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1279‚Äì1325</ENAMEX>), consolidated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Portugal‚</ENAMEX>Äôs borders by constructing castles along the frontier with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Castile</ENAMEX>. 
The last of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Afonsin</ENAMEX> dynasty, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fernando</ENAMEX> I (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1367‚Äì1383</ENAMEX>), formed an alliance with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> and appealed for support in his disputes with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fernando</ENAMEX> died without an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heir</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> claimed the throne through a web of intermarriages between the two royal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> was backed by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> aristocrats, eager to avoid war. 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Juan</ENAMEX> I of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Castile</ENAMEX> invaded <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1383</TIMEX>, but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jo√</ENAMEX>£o of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avis</ENAMEX>, recently proclaimed <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">King Jo√£o I</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX>, defeated the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spaniards</ENAMEX> in a decisive battle which was fought in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1385</TIMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aljubarrota</ENAMEX>, about 100km (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">62 miles</NUMEX>) north of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lisbon</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Batalha Abbey</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45</NUMEX>) was built in gratitude. The victory secured independence from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>. A new alliance with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX> was sealed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1386 Treaty</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Windsor</ENAMEX>; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year later</TIMEX> Jo√£o of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avis</ENAMEX> married <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philippa</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lancaster</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">John of Gaunt</ENAMEX>. Their <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> surviving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Duke</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Viseu, Master of the Order of Christ</ENAMEX>, would change the map of the world. Ultimately he become known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry the Navigator</ENAMEX>.
Building an <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Empire</ENAMEX>
With <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Portugal</ENAMEX> facing the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic Ocean</ENAMEX> , rather than the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean Sea</ENAMEX>, it remained cut off from most trade routes. However, as the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottoman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turks</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 15th century</TIMEX> dominated the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX> and shipbuilding technology improved, longer <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX> journeys became a serious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prospect</ENAMEX>. Peace with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1411</TIMEX> prompted <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX> to seek overseas conquests. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prince Henry</ENAMEX> retired to what was known as the ‚Äúend-of-the-world,‚Äù the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Sagres</ENAMEX> peninsula in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">101</NUMEX>). There he established a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> of navigation that attracted astronomers, cartographers, and other leading <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry</ENAMEX> established expeditions that ultimately succeeded in redefining <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Europeans‚</ENAMEX>Äô very understanding of the world. During <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Henry‚</ENAMEX>Äôs lifetime, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">caravels</ENAMEX> sailed far beyond the westernmost point of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX>. With the colonization of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madeira</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Azores</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">foundations</ENAMEX> were laid for the future <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">empire</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> also sailed down the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">west coast of Africa</ENAMEX>, going beyond <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cape Bojador</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1434</TIMEX>, a feat theretofore considered to be impossible.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry</ENAMEX> died in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1460</TIMEX>, but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Portugal‚</ENAMEX>Äôs discovery voyages continued. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX> who ruled over the golden age of exploration¬<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">†‚Äî¬†and exploitation¬†‚Äî¬†was Manuel I ‚ÄúThe Fortunate</ENAMEX>,‚Äù who reigned from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1495‚Äì1521</NUMEX>. The many important discoveries that were made during his reign would assure his position as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Europe‚</ENAMEX>Äôs richest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ruler</ENAMEX>: He could well afford to erect monuments as elegant as the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Tower of Bel√©m</ENAMEX> and as impressive as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jer√≥nimos Monastery</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lisbon</ENAMEX>. 
The architecture that eased <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gothic</ENAMEX> into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> still bears his name: the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manueline</ENAMEX> style is whimsically flamboyant and decorative, and rife with references to the sea.
The most significant expedition under <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Manuel‚Äôs</ENAMEX> flag was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vasco da Gama‚</ENAMEX>Äôs legendary sea voyage from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lisbon</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1497¬†‚Äî¬†immortalized</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">The Lusiads</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1572</TIMEX>), the epic poem by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Portugal‚Äôs</ENAMEX> national <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poet</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lu√≠s de Cam√µes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1524‚Äì1580</ENAMEX>). Rounding what is now known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cape</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Good Hope</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">da Gama</ENAMEX> found what <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Columbus</ENAMEX> had been searching for in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1492</TIMEX> (although in the wrong direction): the sea-route to the lucrative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spices</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> thus ended the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Venetian</ENAMEX> monopoly on <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Eastern</ENAMEX> trade and began attracting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">merchants</ENAMEX> from all over <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lisbon</ENAMEX>. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>, the planet‚Äôs foremost maritime powers, agreed to divide the world between them by means of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1494 Treaty of Tordesillas</ENAMEX>. This accorded everything lying <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 370</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">leagues</ENAMEX> west of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cape Verde Islands</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>, while everything lying to the east went to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX>, thus giving <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX> a free hand in exploiting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Orient</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1500</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Portuguese explorer Pedro √Ålvares Cabral</ENAMEX> accidentally reached <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brazil</ENAMEX>. 
Trading posts were set up all along the west and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">east</ENAMEX> coasts of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX>, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Middle East</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hormuz</ENAMEX>), southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goa</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malaysia</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Malacca</ENAMEX>), and even in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macau</ENAMEX>). Profits came primarily from trading in eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spices</ENAMEX>, silk and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">porcelain</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX>, and slaves, as well as through importing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">copious sugar</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brazil</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S√£o Tom√©.</ENAMEX>
Wealth helped disguise inherent weaknesses in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. It was not long before other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nations</ENAMEX>, such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX>, began challenging the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> monopoly on the spice trade. 
No entrepreneurial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> developed, as it did in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holland</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX>. The only real <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">entrepreneurs</ENAMEX> were the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX>, who were forced either to embrace Christianity or face expulsion. The <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Inquisition</ENAMEX> took root in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1530s</TIMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Counter-Reformationary Jesuit</ENAMEX> order gained control of education in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1560s</TIMEX>.
The general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> was sorely depleted, many having left for the new <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX>. When the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX> (and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cardinal</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">) Dom Henrique</ENAMEX> died leaving no heir in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1580</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philip II</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> marched in and, backed by wealthy <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX>, forced the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">union</ENAMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> crowns. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spanish Rule</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Restoration</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philip II</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> became <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Filipe I</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1581</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philip</ENAMEX> upheld <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> autonomy, making no attempt to unite his <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> kingdoms. It took <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60 years</TIMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> to organize a successful uprising against the occupation. On <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 1640¬†‚Äî¬</TIMEX>†a date still celebrated as <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Portugal‚Äôs Restoration Day¬†‚Äî¬†Spanish</ENAMEX> rule was finally completely overthrown. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Duke</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bragan√ßa</ENAMEX> was crowned <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">King Jo√£o IV</ENAMEX> in a festive ceremony that took place on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lisbon‚</ENAMEX>Äôs beautiful riverfront <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Terreiro do Pa√ßo</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pra√</ENAMEX>ßa do <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Com√©rcio</ENAMEX>).
His <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandson</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Jo√£o V</ENAMEX>, enjoyed a long and glittering reign (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1706‚Äì1750</ENAMEX>). As money poured in from gold discoveries in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brazil</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX> spent it on lavish monuments and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> (including the spectacular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">aqueduct</ENAMEX> that still brings fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> into the center of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lisbon</ENAMEX>). Portugal‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX>, overburdened with taxes, bore the brunt of the king‚Äôs extravagances.
Destruction, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rebuilding</ENAMEX>, and 
the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Peninsular War</ENAMEX>
The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">middle of the 18th century</TIMEX> marks a great divide between early history and modern times in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX>. On <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">All Saints‚Äô Day</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November 1755</TIMEX>, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowds</ENAMEX> packed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX> to honor the dead, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lisbon</ENAMEX> and parts of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX> all the way to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve</ENAMEX> were devastated by one of the worst earthquakes ever recorded. Churches crumbled, the waters of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tagus</ENAMEX> heaved into a tidal wave, and fires spread throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. The three-dimensional disaster is estimated to have killed <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">between 15,000 and 60,000 people¬†‚Äî¬†a</NUMEX> trajedy of immense proportions.
The task of rebuilding fell to the power behind the throne, an ambitious and tyrannical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minister</ENAMEX> known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sebasti√£o Jos√© de Carvalho e Melo</ENAMEX>, best remembered as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marqu√™s de Pombal</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pombal</ENAMEX> dominated <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX> as an enlightened despot, banishing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jesuits</ENAMEX> and executing certain <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the nobility who may have been involved in an assassination attempt on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX>. He abolished slavery, reformed education, and diversified <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> trade. Although he lost his hold on power shortly after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jos√</ENAMEX>©‚Äôs death in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1777</TIMEX>, many of his reforms survived, laying the foundation for the modern <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>.
At <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the beginning of the 19th century</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Napoleon</ENAMEX> managed to drag <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX> into the heat of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Europe‚</ENAMEX>Äôs conflicts. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> invaded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1807</TIMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX> refused to close its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ports</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> shipping. The royal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> fled to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brazil</ENAMEX> aboard a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ship</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">general</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arthur Wellesley</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Duke</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wellington</ENAMEX>), countered the invasions. The final battle came in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1810‚Äì1811</NUMEX>, when the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>, unable to pass the huge fortifications at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Torres Vedras</ENAMEX>, retreated back to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Fall of the Monarchy</ENAMEX>
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1814</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX> made peace with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brazil</ENAMEX> was raised to the status of a full <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">kingdom</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the following year</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Portugal</ENAMEX> itself was ruled as a virtual <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> protectorate. A military coup in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1820</TIMEX> finally persuaded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jo√£o VI</ENAMEX> to return to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1821</TIMEX> and agree to a new constitution.
Peace proved elusive, though, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> was again torn by war¬†‚Äî¬†this time pitting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> against <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pedro IV</ENAMEX>, previously <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emperor</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brazil</ENAMEX> (which had asserted its independence from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX>), fought to wrest the crown from <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Miguel I</ENAMEX>, his absolutist <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pedro</ENAMEX> won, though he died of consumption <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">only months later</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the age of 36</TIMEX>. His adolescent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maria da Gl√≥ria</ENAMEX>, assumed the throne. 
Widespread discontent arose from continued government instability, futile attempts to modernize the economy, and coffers depleted from the cost of maintaining overseas <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">idealists</ENAMEX> led a failed coup in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1891</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> declared itself bankrupt in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1892</TIMEX>, and emigration reached unprecedented levels. Finally, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1908</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carlos</ENAMEX> and his eldest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lu√≠s Filipe</ENAMEX>, were assassinated as they rode in an open <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">carriage</ENAMEX> through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pra√</ENAMEX>ßa do <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Com√©rcio</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX>) in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lisbon</ENAMEX>. The younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> survived to become <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Manuel II</ENAMEX>, but he was deposed merely <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years later</TIMEX> and forced to flee to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>, thus ending <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">over 750 years</TIMEX> of monarchy.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Republic</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New State</ENAMEX>
The new <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">republic</ENAMEX> was unable to provide the stability <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX> needed. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Governments</ENAMEX> changed no less than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45</NUMEX> times <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1910 and 1926</TIMEX>, and the country‚Äôs disastrous involvement in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War</ENAMEX> led to economic chaos. After a revolution in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1926</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Ant√≥nio √ìscar Carmona</ENAMEX> assumed control, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years later</TIMEX> entrusting the economy to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ant√≥nio de Oliveira Salazar</ENAMEX>, an economics <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coimbra University</ENAMEX>. The exhausted <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> finances immediately perked up.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1932</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salazar</ENAMEX> was named <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prime Minister</ENAMEX>. His austere authoritarian regime¬†‚Äî¬†the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Estado Novo</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">New State)¬†‚Äî¬†favored</ENAMEX> economic progress and nationalism. He kept <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX> neutral in <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX>, but permitted the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Allies</ENAMEX> to use the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Azores</ENAMEX> as a base. 
Toward the Present
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salazar‚Äôs New State</ENAMEX> began to unravel when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Portugal‚</ENAMEX>Äôs former <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> demanded independence. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1974</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX> carrying red carnations in their <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">rifle</ENAMEX> barrels successfully deposed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> in a peaceful coup that came to be known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">‚ÄúCarnation Revolution</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äù Portugal</ENAMEX> then disengaged itself from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mozambique</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Angola</ENAMEX>, its seething colonial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">possessions</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> absorbed the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">million or so</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">refugees</ENAMEX> who fled to a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">motherland</ENAMEX> most had never seen. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX> suffered <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several years</TIMEX> of political confusion, but stable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">democracy</ENAMEX> finally took hold. With its entry into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Union</ENAMEX> (formerly the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Economic Community</ENAMEX>) in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</TIMEX>, the pace of development suddenly quickened. With aid from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX> became one of the fastest-growing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Portugal</ENAMEX> hosted the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World Expo</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lisbon</ENAMEX>, and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>, further consolidated its <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">membership</ENAMEX> by accepting the gradual introduction of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Euro</ENAMEX>, the single currency also adopted by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>, and others. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pope John Paul II</ENAMEX> paid his <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> visit to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shrine</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">F√</ENAMEX>°tima in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> and beatified (the final step before sainthood) the shepherd <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> who claimed to be visited by the Virgin <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary</ENAMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a period of six months</TIMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1913</TIMEX>.
