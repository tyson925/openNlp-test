Where to Go
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">PROVINCE OF SANTA CRUZ DE</ENAMEX> TENERIFE:
Tenerife, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Hierro</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">La Gomera</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">La Palma</ENAMEX>(telephone code <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">928</NUMEX>):
Tenerife
Area: <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2,046 sq km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">790 sq miles)¬†‚Äî¬</NUMEX>†the largest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Population</ENAMEX>: 666,000
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tenerife</ENAMEX> is not only the largest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canaries geographically</ENAMEX>, it also offers the tourist more sights, more attractions, more <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> and cities to explore, and more contrasts than any of the other islands. Where else can you look around a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">banana</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plantation</ENAMEX> and then take a short drive half-way up a mountain for a snowball fight?
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tenerife</ENAMEX> has been welcoming <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> from cold northern climes since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th century</TIMEX>. However, the focus has changed from the cloudy, green <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">north coast</ENAMEX> where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Puerto de la Cruz</ENAMEX> was once the favorite <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> (it is still enormously popular), to the hot, dry, arid south.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Cruz de</ENAMEX> Tenerife
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tenerife</ENAMEX> and the administrative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">center</ENAMEX> for the westerly <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Canaries</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Cruz</ENAMEX> is not a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> spend a great deal of time. The main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Plaza de Espa√±a</ENAMEX>, in the middle of which stands a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-sided cross, a memorial to the dead of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Spanish Civil War</ENAMEX>. The huge, drab, gray building adjacent to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Plaza</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cabildo Insular</ENAMEX> (local government <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX>) which also houses the tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museo Arqueol√≥gico</ENAMEX>, with important exhibits illustrating the life and death rituals of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Guanche</ENAMEX> society (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> is open <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tuesday‚ÄìSunday 10am‚Äì8pm</ENAMEX> and the entrance fee is <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a mere 400 pesetas</NUMEX> (free on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sundays</TIMEX>). Back on the seafront, discover the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iglesia Matriz de la Concepci√≥n</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Church of the Immaculate Conception</ENAMEX>). Dating from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 16th century</TIMEX>, this is the town‚Äôs most important historical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> and contains several interesting relics, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nelson‚</ENAMEX>Äôs faded battle flag.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Puerto de la Cruz</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Puerto</ENAMEX>, as this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> is often abbreviated to, has neither good beaches nor the abundant sunshine of the south, yet for many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">travelers</ENAMEX> it is the most complete <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> on the island. It has been attracting convalescing northern <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Europeans</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">over a century</TIMEX> and it maintains much of its colonial grandeur. The seafront promenade has been quite heavily commercialized but not at all spoiled, and the atmosphere is always lively without being boisterous. The main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Plaza de Charco</ENAMEX>, is the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">hub</ENAMEX> of both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourist</ENAMEX> and local life, and its numerous caf√©s, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> are busy at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">all hours</TIMEX>. Just off the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>, the old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> around the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Pesquero</ENAMEX> is remarkably oblivious to change. Among the narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> with faded wooden <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">balconies</ENAMEX> and carved doors are the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Casa de Miranda</ENAMEX>, now a crafts <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop</ENAMEX> and restaurant, and, oldest of all, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Casa de la Real Aduana</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Customs House</ENAMEX>), built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1620</TIMEX>, facing the tiny <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port</ENAMEX>.
The problem of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Puerto‚</ENAMEX>Äôs lack of a decent beach was brilliantly addressed by the late <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">C√©sar Manrique</ENAMEX> who designed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lago Marti√°nez</ENAMEX>, which is open <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:45am</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5pm</TIMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">This 3-hectare</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">8-acre</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> of tropical lagoons, cascading fountains and sunbathing terraces is cleverly landscaped with lush <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">palms</ENAMEX> and black-and-white volcanic rocks to fit perfectly into the seafront, where the surf crashes spectacularly against the rocks.
There are numerous places on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tenerife</ENAMEX> competing for the attention of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX>, but there is one, just to the west of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto</ENAMEX>, that absolutely should not be missed. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Loro Parque</ENAMEX>; (open <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:30am‚Äì5pm</TIMEX>, admission: 2,900 ptas, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">r17.43</ENAMEX>) has the world‚Äôs largest collection of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">parrots¬†‚Äî¬†more</ENAMEX> than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> and subspecies. It is also home to the most eclectic array of animals including <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">gorillas</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">chimpanzees</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">tigers</ENAMEX>, jaguars, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">alligators</ENAMEX>, sea-<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">lions</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dolphins</ENAMEX> and numerous other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">creatures</ENAMEX> that are exhibited in carefully and creatively, designed spaces. Look also for the underwater world of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">aquarium</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">shark tunnel</ENAMEX>, and the newest, and undoubtedly most inventive display. The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Planet Penguin</ENAMEX>, the largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Penguinarium</ENAMEX> in the world, covers <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3,900 square m</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">nearly 1 acre</NUMEX>) and has been created as a natural habitat for these <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">engaging creatures</ENAMEX>. The temperature of their iceberg is kept at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">between -2¬∫</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2¬∫ C</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">28¬∫‚Äì36¬∫</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>) with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">12 tons</NUMEX> of artificial snow falling on it <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> through openings in the roof. The surrounding sea is chilled to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10¬∫ C</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50¬∫</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Visitors</ENAMEX> are conveyed around on a moving walkway that allows the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">King</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gentoo</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockhopper</ENAMEX> penguins to be seen cavorting on land and in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>. Look also for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">dolphin</ENAMEX>, sea <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">lion</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">parrot</ENAMEX> shows, and animal feedings.
Just north of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto</ENAMEX>, on the road to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">La Orotavo</ENAMEX>, there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> places, both open <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily 9am‚Äì6pm</TIMEX>, that have similar themes, but exhibit them in rather different ways. The oldest of these, and closest to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, is undoubtedly the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jard√≠n Bot√°nico</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Botanical Garden</ENAMEX>), founded by royal decree in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1788</TIMEX>. Covering <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">some 2.5 hectares</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6 acres</NUMEX>), it has palms of every <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">variety</TIMEX> and the centerpiece is a huge <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">South American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">fig tree</ENAMEX> whose enormous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branches</ENAMEX> and roots have become intertwined into one great tree <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>. Further on, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bananera El Guanche</ENAMEX> provides fascinating insight into how a Canarian <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">banana</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plantation</ENAMEX> operates. By way of a multi-lingual introductory video show, a surprisingly informative and entertaining brochure, and exhibits in its <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">12,000-sq-m</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">nearly 3-acre</NUMEX>) park which boasts, besides numerous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bananas</ENAMEX>, a superb collection of exotic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">shrubs</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>, and cacti from all over the world (open <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily 9am‚Äì6pm</TIMEX>; admission <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,000</NUMEX> ptas, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">r6.01</ENAMEX>).
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Orotava</ENAMEX> is a remarkably well-preserved, unspoiled old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> set on a steep hill high above its old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Puerto de la Cruz</ENAMEX>. Stately <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansions</ENAMEX>, ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX>, and cobbled <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> are its trademarks. The twin <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">towers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baroque fa√ßade</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Byzantine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dome</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iglesia Nuestra Se√±ora de la Concepci√≥n</ENAMEX> dominate a fascinating skyline that has remained virtually unchanged for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX>. Continue on up Calle <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Casas de los Balcones</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Houses of the Balconies</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">balconies</ENAMEX> in question are inside the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house‚Äôs courtyard</ENAMEX> and are some of the finest examples of their kind. This splendid <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansion</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Casa de Turista</ENAMEX> (built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1590</TIMEX>) opposite are now <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> dedicated to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canary</ENAMEX> handicrafts.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North of Puerto</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Sauzal</ENAMEX> is important for its <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wines</ENAMEX>, and this industry is shown to its best effect at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Casa del Vino ‚ÄúLa Baranda‚Äù</ENAMEX> (open <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tuesday‚ÄìSaturday 11am‚Äì8pm</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sundays</TIMEX> and holidays 11am‚<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Äì6pm</TIMEX>, admission free). See how the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> is made in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>, then enjoy wine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tastings</ENAMEX> and purchase your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">favorites</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop</ENAMEX>. There is also a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX> and restaurant, both with fine views over the coast. Tacoronte, nearby, is renowned for a much-venerated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17th-century</TIMEX> figure of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christ</ENAMEX>. Known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cristo de los Dolores</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christ</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sorrows</ENAMEX>) it stands in the local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> of the same name.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Laguna</ENAMEX>, declared a World Heritage Site by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UNESCO</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late in 1999</TIMEX>, is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tenerife‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> largest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> and known as the ecclesiastic and cultural capital of the island. However, it is not well-visited by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX>. Start at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plaza del Adelantado</ENAMEX>, and a short way along <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Calle Obispo Rey Redondo</ENAMEX> is the cathedral of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Laguna</ENAMEX> with its landmark twin bell <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">towers</ENAMEX>. It is a surprisingly modern <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> in spite of its design, consecrated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1913</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">over 400 years</TIMEX> after the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> was founded. Continue on the same <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> to the town‚Äôs oldest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Iglesia de Nuestra Se√±ora de la Concepci√≥n</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Church of the Immaculate Conception</ENAMEX>), built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1497</TIMEX>. Its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX>-story <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">belfry</ENAMEX> and watchtower were added <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries later</TIMEX>. The interior is outstanding, with exquisite timber carvings on the ceiling and pulpit and an enormous <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Baroque altarpiece</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Flemish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panels</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">West of Puerto</ENAMEX>
A full day‚Äôs outing from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Puerto de la Cruz</ENAMEX> along the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">unspoiled</ENAMEX> north and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">west</ENAMEX> coasts covers some of the island‚Äôs most spectacular sights and scenery. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sleepy Icod de Los Vinos</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">home</ENAMEX> of the botanical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">freak</ENAMEX> that is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Drago Milenario</ENAMEX>, a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1,000-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dragon Tree</ENAMEX>.
Continue west on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">coast</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Icod</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Garachico</ENAMEX> and after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">6 km</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3.7 miles</NUMEX>) the tortuous descent begins. There are marvelous views looking directly down onto this compact little <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhabitants</ENAMEX>, set on a small peninsula with the waves crashing all around. The peninsula is actually formed from the volcanic debris that was deposited following a disastrous eruption in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1706</TIMEX>, when most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> and its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhabitants</ENAMEX> were destroyed. The best place to survey the aftermath of the petrified lava is from the beautifully preserved <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Castillo de San Miguel</ENAMEX>. A lucky <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">survivor</ENAMEX>, this fortress (note the heraldic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX> above the doorway), is now devoted to handicraft sales. There is no beach to speak of here, but a very cleverly designed set of pools built into the rocks more than compensates. Despite the destruction, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Garachico</ENAMEX> is a little gem. Neat <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> boasting typically attractive Canarian balconies line cobbled <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>, and old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX> adorn pretty squares. Unmissable, also, is the large, uninhabited rock out in the bay, and it has managed to gain for itself a place in the spiritual life of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Garachico</ENAMEX>. Without a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patron saint</ENAMEX> of its own, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> has elevated the rock to be its saint!
Farther along the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">coast</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">8 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 miles</NUMEX>) past <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buenavista del Norte</ENAMEX>, lies the most westerly point on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tenerife</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Punta de Teno</ENAMEX>. From here there are panoramic views across to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Gomera</ENAMEX> and looking south to the massive cliffs of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Gigantes</ENAMEX>. Turn back to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buenavista</ENAMEX> and take a marked turn inland to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Masca</ENAMEX>. Be warned, though, this is absolutely not a drive to be undertaken by inexperienced or nervous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drivers</ENAMEX>. Initially the road, although ascending through the arable mountainside, is no problem; but this soon changes once the entrance to the vertiginous valley is reached. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> glance at the narrow, steeply twisting <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> on either side will be enough to realize why, up to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">only a few years ago</TIMEX>, the picturesque tiny <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Masca</ENAMEX> could only be reached on the back of a donkey. All around is some of the most dramatic scenery on the island. However, if you are driving, you won‚Äôt have any time to savor it. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> clings precariously to the side of lush, green mountains cleft by deep, dark ravines and often zig-zags on itself in the tightest of hairpin bends. And it is far from unknown to have to reverse back down and around these bends, allowing other <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicles</ENAMEX> to pass. A stop at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Masca</ENAMEX> is not just a pleasure, but also a relief. Relax at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> down from the road, and enjoy the stupendous scenery before continuing south on an equally difficult drive, to rejoin the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santiago del Teide</ENAMEX>.
A little farther south, turn off towards <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto de Santiago</ENAMEX>, then walk out to the edge of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">marina</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">jetty</ENAMEX> to get the best view of the enormous sheer cliffs, up to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">800</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2,625 ft</NUMEX>) high, known appropriately as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Gigantes</ENAMEX> (The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giants</ENAMEX>).
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Central Area</ENAMEX>
There are several approaches to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Las Ca√±adas National Park</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mount Teide</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> is well sign-posted from the road via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Orotava</ENAMEX>, but if you are coming from the north, then the most picturesque route is via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Esperanza</ENAMEX>. The small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> soon gives way to a lush forest of giant pines and eucalyptus <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">21‚ÅÑ2 miles</NUMEX>) south at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Las Ra√≠ces</ENAMEX> is where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Franco</ENAMEX> met with his co-conspirators in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1936</TIMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>). An obelisk in the forest commemorates the event. As the road gains altitude and temperatures fall, the views become ever more spectacular. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Mirador Pico de las Flores</ENAMEX> looks out over to the southeast and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mirador de Ortu√±o</ENAMEX> offers a panorama of the northern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">coast</ENAMEX>. Highest of all at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 2,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6,562 ft</NUMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mirador las Cumbres</ENAMEX> reveals <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Teide</ENAMEX> in all her glory.
The entrance to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">National Park</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Portillo de las Ca√±adas</ENAMEX>, where there is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitor center</ENAMEX> (open <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily 9am‚Äì4pm</TIMEX>). If you wish to walk in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>, pick up a leaflet or ask for information about the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> guided walks. Note that during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> the environment can become quite harsh, and you should never undertake walks without consulting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitor center</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>. At this point it is quite likely that you will be in the clouds; temperatures are very low, and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> there may well be snow on the ground. The landscape becomes very lunar-like; it was around here that some of the filming for <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Planet of the Apes</ENAMEX> took place. The ascent to the top of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mount Teide</ENAMEX> can be made by climbing, or by the new cable <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">telef√©rico</ENAMEX>), an <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">eight-minute</TIMEX> ride (open <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily 9am‚Äì4pm</TIMEX>, admission: 2,500 ptas, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">r15.03</ENAMEX>). Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> choose the cable <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>, but it‚Äôs worth noting that even after leaving the cable car it is still a good climb to the summit at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,717</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">12,195 ft</NUMEX>). However, if you really want to venture that far you have to go in person and with a photocopy of your passport, to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office of the Parque Nacional del Teide</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Calle Emilio Calzadilla</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38002</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Cruz de Tenerife</ENAMEX>). Even then, there is a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> limit of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">just 50</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, for conservation sake, allowed up <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the last 200 m</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">219 yards</NUMEX>) to the summit. Once there, you should be able to count off all the other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canary Islands</ENAMEX> and, on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a good day</TIMEX>, see <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North Africa</ENAMEX>. Impressive as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Teide</ENAMEX> is, it is basically no more than a peak on the edge of a giant volcano which long ago erupted or imploded. Left behind is the vast <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Caldera</ENAMEX> (volcanic crater) which is most apparent from the area known as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Roques</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Los Roques</ENAMEX> are a group of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">giant</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flamboyantly</ENAMEX> shaped lumps of volcanic rock rising out of the crater; often visited and photographed.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Coast</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Candelaria</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> with deep religious roots. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Legend</ENAMEX> has it that well before Christianity came to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canaries</ENAMEX> an image of the Virgin was washed ashore here and worshipped by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guanches</ENAMEX>, who were quite oblivious to its <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> significance. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spaniards</ENAMEX> later built a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> dedicated to the statue. Sadly, both the statue and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> were destroyed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1826</TIMEX> when a tidal wave reclaimed the Virgin. The present over-sized basilica was built soon afterwards. The splendid new statue of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nuestra Se√±ora de la Candelaria</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patron saint</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canary Islands</ENAMEX>, is the object of a major pilgrimage in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-August</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guanches</ENAMEX> are not forgotten either: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> chieftains stand guard in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a row</TIMEX>, with their backs to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX>. These idealized cavemen are truly noble savages.
Just south and inland from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Candelaria</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">G√º√≠mar</ENAMEX>, which with the exception of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> curiosity is easily overlooked. However, those with an interest in the history of these islands will be intrigued by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pir√°mides de G√º√</ENAMEX>≠mar <www.fredolsen.es/piramides>. The step pyramids (also known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chacona</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pyramids</ENAMEX>) here didn‚Äôt become evident until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1990s</TIMEX>. They came to the notice of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Norwegian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">anthropologist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thor Heyerdahl</ENAMEX>, internationally acclaimed for his transoceanic crossings with prehistoric <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX> and theories about human migration. After studying photos he came to the conclusion that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chacona</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pyramids</ENAMEX> were similar in principal to those in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Old</ENAMEX> and New worlds. Subsequently, he took a personal interest and began to relate their existence to pre-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanic</ENAMEX> civilizations that either lived, or visited, the island. Today, on view, are not only the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pyramids</ENAMEX> themselves, but models of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heyerdahl‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX>, a video detailing his summaries and transoceanic crossings, and various other interesting audio-visual displays.
There is little else of interest after here until you reach the south of the island. The most popular tourist destinations in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tenerife</ENAMEX> are the adjacent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Cristianos</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Playa de las Am√©ricas.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Los Cristianos</ENAMEX> used to be a small fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port</ENAMEX> with a quiet little beach. It now plays host to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds of thousands</NUMEX> of mainly <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> and fewer <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vacationers</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each year</TIMEX> and its small beach, inside the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port</ENAMEX>, is woefully inadequate. Traces of the old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> can still be found around the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port</ENAMEX>, though it is difficult to locate anything but <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> along the crowded beachfront.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Playa de las Am√©ricas</ENAMEX> was born in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1970s</TIMEX> and has quickly developed from a bare shoreline to the high-rise, high-energy, highly packaged resort it is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>. Here the beachside <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX> are not <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX>, nor even international: they are mainly <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>. In the evenings, of course, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX> compete with each other, some even advertising which <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> beers they sell on local <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> radio <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stations</ENAMEX>, for this lucrative and ever thirsty market. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Discos</ENAMEX>, too, are ever popular with the younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX>, but when they spill out in the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early hours of the morning</TIMEX>, good-natured <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boisterousness</ENAMEX> can sometimes result in rowdiness. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beware</ENAMEX>, also, of the dangers of muggings.
On the other side of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Playa de las Am√©ricas</ENAMEX>, but with a border as indistinguishable as that with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Cristianos</ENAMEX>, is the newly popular area of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Costa Adeje</ENAMEX>, but here it really is rather different. The wall-to-wall <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX>, fast food <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">places</ENAMEX> and other such popular activities with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Germans</ENAMEX> gives way to much more elegant, spacious, cleverly designed resort <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> offering such extensive <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> that you don‚Äôt even have to leave the property¬†‚Äî¬†creating a much more agreeable ambiance than that of its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">near neighbors</ENAMEX>.
There is, of course, no shortage of entertainment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Puerto de Col√≥n</ENAMEX> has become not just a favorite place to wander around and watch the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX>, but a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> for some really neat and unusual adventures that merit description. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">submarine</ENAMEX> trip will appeal to most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Submarine Adventure</ENAMEX> will take you under the ocean on a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">45-minute</TIMEX> trip in their yellow <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">submarine</ENAMEX>. Through the picture windows you can monitor the progress, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>, yourselves. The highlight is when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">submarine</ENAMEX> passes some wrecks on the sea bed which have become a haven for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>, notably an array of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">stingrays</ENAMEX>,¬†some of which are frighteningly huge. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Safari B.O.B. Diving</ENAMEX> has a more novel way of getting you underwater. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B.O.B.</ENAMEX> stands for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breathing Observatory Bubble</ENAMEX>, and these are said to be the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. It is rather like a vertical scooter, and consists of a large bubble over your head and a steering apparatus by your waist. You get <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 20 minutes</TIMEX> of submerged time in the waters north of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port</ENAMEX> (open <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Monday‚ÄìThursday</ENAMEX>; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX>.), and the cost is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6,500 ptas</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">r39.07</NUMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>. Speed <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Boat Safari</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NautiOcio Watersports</ENAMEX> is the latest, and fastest, water adventure; following an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">instructor</ENAMEX> you will drive your own boat exploring small bays and caves and stopping for swimming and snorkeling (all equipment provided: 10,000 ptas, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">r60.10</NUMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>).
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">El Hierro</ENAMEX>
Area: <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">297 sq km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">107 sq miles</NUMEX>)
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Population</ENAMEX>: 8,000
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Hierro</ENAMEX> has hardly any tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX>, no natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spectacles</ENAMEX>, and no good beaches, but it is pretty, quiet, and totally unspoiled. More than enough attributes, for many, to pay a visit. However, the configuration of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX> makes exploration a frustrating affair, as it is impossible to make a circular tour as <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX> just do not join up.
In the southwest corner of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">archipelago El Hierro</ENAMEX> was, at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time, considered to be the end of the known world and for that reason it was used as the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> meridian, which has long since relocated to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greenwich</ENAMEX>.
Valverde
The only <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canaries</ENAMEX> capital located inland, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Valverde</ENAMEX> was built high on a mountainside to protect it from pirate raids, and is a very small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, with only a parador and a few other places offering tourist accommodation.
The Rest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Island</ENAMEX>
From <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valverde</ENAMEX> follow the road to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isora</ENAMEX>, a neat little village of well-tended gardens. There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> miradors to enjoy on the road to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Pinar</ENAMEX>. The name comes from the pinewood <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">forests</ENAMEX> that in places make up a gentle rolling landscape of fields and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> reminiscent of northern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. As the road descends south the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">greenery</ENAMEX> eventually peters out into volcanic badlands, and at the tip of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> is the fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Restinga</ENAMEX>.
The switchback road down to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frontera</ENAMEX> passes fertile cultivated fields and the occasional disused lagar (winepress). The bell <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> here is something of an oddity, being divorced from its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> and set on top of a small hill next to it. From a distance the tiny <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> set against the massive cliff side seems terribly remote, but as you approach it the illusion disappears and the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> passes within <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">feet</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cliffs</ENAMEX> here, and all along the stretch of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">north coast</ENAMEX> known as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Golfo</ENAMEX>, were once actually part of an immense volcanic crater. However, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 50,000</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX> one side of it slid, violently, into the sea, leaving behind a gigantic bay with a semi-circumference of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">25 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">15.5 miles</NUMEX>) and cliffs of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to 1,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3,280 ft</NUMEX>). Although the last eruption on the island was over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">200 years ago</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">El Hierro</ENAMEX>, actually, has the highest density of volcanoes in the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">archipelago</ENAMEX>. There are over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cones</ENAMEX> on the surface, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an additional 300</NUMEX> covered by lava flows.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> west leads to the village of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sabinosa</ENAMEX>, and just south of here, though only accessible by a long journey, is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ermita de los Reyes</ENAMEX> and the forest of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Sabinal</ENAMEX>. The forest is made up of juniper <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> (sabinosas) which are incredibly and grotesquely twisted, stunted, gnarled, and, in some cases, almost bent double by the wind.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mirador de la Pe√±a</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">8 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 miles</NUMEX>) west of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valverde</ENAMEX>, is the newest, the most impressive, and arguably the only real tourist attraction on the island. Those familiar with the work of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C√©sar Manrique</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>) will not need an introduction. The views are marvelous and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX> is one of the best on the island.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LA Gomera</ENAMEX>
Area: <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">372 sq km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">146 sq miles)¬†‚Äî¬</NUMEX>†the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">sixth</NUMEX> largest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Population</ENAMEX>: 17,000
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Gomera</ENAMEX> is, indeed, a dramatic and rugged mountainous island. It has a coastline that is dominated by dramatic cliffs¬<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">†‚Äî¬†there</ENAMEX> are very few beaches, and the interior is full of vertiginous, mostly verdant, valleys that are often lined with narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">fields</ENAMEX> stepped into the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">sides</ENAMEX> of the mountains. For extra effect these valleys are more often than not covered by a ceiling of cloud, whisked in by the trade winds, which seem to perpetually hang over the island. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>, there is the unusually dense growth of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">fauna</ENAMEX> in what is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parque Nacional Garajonay</ENAMEX> (open <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tuesday‚</ENAMEX>ÄìSunday <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:30am‚Äì4:30pm</TIMEX>). Less than <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">121‚ÅÑ2 miles</NUMEX>) from north to south, this amazing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> has been declared a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Property of Humanity</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UNESCO</ENAMEX>. In fact, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a third</NUMEX> of the island, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">12,450 hectares</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">30,774 acres</NUMEX>) has been designated into seventeen protected areas. Such terrain, though, makes for difficulty in getting around, and even the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Romans</ENAMEX>, had they ventured this way, would have found their legendary ability to build straight <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX> put to an impossible test. In fact, almost nowhere on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> will you find a straight stretch of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>, everywhere you go the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX> twist and turn continually, often turning back on themselves in hairpin bends. Making driving even more complicated is the fact that the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX>, although improving, are often of poor quality, and the directional signs leave much to be desired.
Just <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">40 minutes</TIMEX> away from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tenerife</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Gomera</ENAMEX> nevertheless remains unspoiled and authentic, with its steep, green, terraced hills and tranquil valleys.
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">San Sebasti√</ENAMEX>°n
Capital and main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX> of the island, this small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> will always be important as the place where <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Columbus</ENAMEX> took leave of the known world on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 1492</TIMEX>, on the voyage which revealed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New World</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbiana</ENAMEX> starts in the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>. A <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pavement</ENAMEX> mosaic shows the route of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbus‚</ENAMEX>Äôs voyage, and next to the large tree is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Casa de Aduana</ENAMEX> (the old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Customs House</ENAMEX>). According to folklore, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Columbus</ENAMEX> drew <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> from the well here, took it to the New World, and used it to baptize <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>. Leading off the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calle del Medio</ENAMEX> is the only <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> of any consequence in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> and features more connections with the great <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">navigator</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iglesia de la Asunci√≥n</ENAMEX>, built <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between 1490‚Äì1510</NUMEX>, looks and feels so old that you can easily imagine <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Columbus</ENAMEX> praying in a dark recess¬†‚Äî¬†as a plaque here tells us he did, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1492</TIMEX>. A little way up the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> is the modest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Casa Columbiana/Casa de Col√≥n</ENAMEX>, which is supposedly where he stayed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">La Gomera</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North</ENAMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Sebasti√</ENAMEX>°n climbs steeply and the views soon become quite dizzying. The highest peak on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Gomera</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alto de Garajonay</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,487 m</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,878</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ft)¬†‚Äî¬†this</ENAMEX> is no great height by Canaries standards, yet the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> often gives the impression of being a fearsome maze of eerie crags. The small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hermigua</ENAMEX> is the largest on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">San Sebasti√°n</ENAMEX>. Stop at the crafts center of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Telares</ENAMEX> to take a look down into its green and fertile valley, and ask if you can try the local liqueur, mistela, whilst watching <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> making blankets and rugs on their antique looms. After this there are fine views of the impressive cliffs, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agulo</ENAMEX> is a pleasant small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> whose main feature is the domed <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Iglesia San Marco</ENAMEX>, which adjoins a monumental <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">laurel tree</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plaza</ENAMEX>. This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> was originally a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX> during a brief period of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Moorish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">occupation</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th century</TIMEX>.
A turn inland just before the village of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Las Rosas</ENAMEX> is one of the entrances to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Garajonay National Park</ENAMEX>, declared a World Heritage Site by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UNESCO</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Centro de Interpretaci√≥n</ENAMEX> (information <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>); has a small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>, displays and gardens. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> then continues through the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,000</NUMEX>-hectare (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">9,884-acre</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Laguna Grande</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX>, a hospitable, rough-and-ready sort of place, which is very popular with walkers. Unlike the national <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX> at the peaks of many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canary Islands</ENAMEX> there are no views from here, aside from at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Garajonay</ENAMEX> itself, and an almost perpetual thick mist clings to the ancient, moss-covered <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>. As there is little <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rainfall</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">La Gomera this mist</ENAMEX>, spawned by the mystical trade winds, assumes great ecological importance having given life to this sub-tropical forest.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South</ENAMEX>
The main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">San Sebasti√°n</ENAMEX> leads past <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> mighty volcanic plugs, which are nicknamed <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚Äúthe Chinese Hat,‚Äù ‚Äúthe Lion,‚Äù and ‚Äúthe Face of Christ‚Äù</ENAMEX> after their respective outlines. The windy pass of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Degollada de Peraza</ENAMEX> offers spectacular views to both the north and the south, and the road splits here. Rather than continue on to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Garajonay</ENAMEX>, turn left on an equally <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">windy road</ENAMEX> that leads to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Playa Santiago</ENAMEX>. Besides <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Sebasti√</ENAMEX>°n this is one of the few waterside <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> on the island. The unpretentious little <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">port</ENAMEX> and beach is almost totally unspoiled by any outward signs of tourism, even though the cliffs immediately to its east are home to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jard√≠n Tecina</ENAMEX>, a really special self-contained <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX>.
Continue inland, passing the new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX>, and at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Igualero</ENAMEX> turn west onto the minor <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> that crosses to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Las Hayas</ENAMEX>. Stop in the small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Cercado</ENAMEX> where, almost next door to each other, there are the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rufina</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malria</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> where the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> make ceramic goods in the traditional manner. Watch as little old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ladies</ENAMEX> fashion the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">clay</ENAMEX>, and then be tempted to purchase <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end</TIMEX> results, or other goods and antiques that are on sale. Be surprised, also, by the prices; they are nearly as steep as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">island‚Äôs cliffs</ENAMEX> and valleys! From <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Las Hayas</ENAMEX> continue along to the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arure</ENAMEX> where, immediately after turning left, there is a small bodega selling <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wines</ENAMEX> not only from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">La Gomera</ENAMEX> but from throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canary Islands</ENAMEX> too. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Gomera</ENAMEX> actually has <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 300 hectares</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">741.3 acres</NUMEX>) of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">vineyards</ENAMEX> mostly cultivated on uneven land with steep slopes and small terraces. A stop at the highest point of this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> is a must: The views from the combined mirador/restaurant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Escuela C√©sar Manrique</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Valle Gran Rey</ENAMEX> (the multi-tiered valley not the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of the same name) below are stupendous. The small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Valle Gran Rey</ENAMEX> even has a beach of some size, albeit of black <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sand</ENAMEX>, and accompanying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>. Follow the road back through the valley, continue on past <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arure</ENAMEX> and then make a right at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-</ENAMEX>junction with the other main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>, and this leads all the way back to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Sebasti√°n de La Gomera</ENAMEX>, passing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Laguna Grande</ENAMEX> and the entrance to Garajonay along the way.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Palma</ENAMEX>
Area: <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">725 sq km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">280 sq miles)¬†‚Äî¬</NUMEX>†the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX> largest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Population</ENAMEX>: 81,500
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">La Palma</ENAMEX>, the most northwesterly of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canaries</ENAMEX>, has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">nicknames¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†La <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isla Bonita</ENAMEX> (the beautiful island) and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">La Isla Verde</ENAMEX> (the green island), and both are suitable. Beautiful it certainly is, and very green too. Not only that but its statistics are very impressive. The highest peak, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roque de los Muchachos</ENAMEX>, rises <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2,423 m</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">7,950 ft</NUMEX>) above sea level, making it the steepest island in the world in relation to its total area. It is also the only one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canary Islands</ENAMEX> to have even very small streams.

The island <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> is an appealing <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">town¬†‚Äî¬†clean</ENAMEX> and bright with traditional and modern architecture side-by-side creating much charm, especially when compared with many of the other islands‚Äô rather bland <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capitals</ENAMEX>. The importance of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> is such that, during the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> era, it was the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> most important port of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Empire</ENAMEX>, after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sevilla</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Antwerp</ENAMEX>.
The heart of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> is the small triangular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Plaza de Espa√±a</ENAMEX>, set a couple of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> in from the seafront on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calle Real</ENAMEX>. On <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> side of the triangle is the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iglesia Matriz de El Salvador</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Church of the Saviour</ENAMEX>), built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1503</TIMEX>. The ceiling of this big stone <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> is made of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> (heart of pine) and is a fine example of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mudejar</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX> under <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> rule) style of intricate wooden paneling. Next to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> are some splendid examples of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th century</TIMEX> colonial-style <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansions</ENAMEX>, notably the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Casa Monte Verde</ENAMEX>, dating from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1618</TIMEX> but having been rebuilt in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1922‚Äì1923</NUMEX>. The longest side of the triangle is taken up by the ayuntamiento (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Town Hall</ENAMEX>), built <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1559 and 1567</TIMEX> with stone brought from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">La Gomera</ENAMEX>; this is considered the most important <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canary Islands</ENAMEX>. While the arches are <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX>, the interior (which you are free to inspect) is <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> colonial, with formidable carved wooden ceilings and doors, and a ceremonial staircase with frescoes painted by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. Coss√</ENAMEX>≠o around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1950</TIMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calle Real</ENAMEX> is a delightful <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> in which to stroll and enjoy the atmosphere. At its southern end it takes on the improbable title of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calle O‚ÄôDaly</ENAMEX>, named after an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Irish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">banana</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">merchant</ENAMEX> who settled on the island. Look, also, on the parallel <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Avenida Maritimo</ENAMEX> at the wonderfully charming row of old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Casas de los Balcones Houses</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">balconies</ENAMEX>, built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th century</TIMEX>, they have become symbolic of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Cruz</ENAMEX>. Colorful and characteristic, and with a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> influence, they have overhanging <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">balconies</ENAMEX>, and those facing the sea were once used as lookout posts.
Due to the steep, dorsal shape of the island there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> main <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> routes to follow: the loop south of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caldera de Taburiente</ENAMEX> or the loop north of it. The southern route is the more interesting of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern Loop</ENAMEX>
Heading west from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Cruz</ENAMEX> the first stop of interest is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Nieves</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> built on the mountainside. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> indication of it is a roadside <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX>, followed by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Santuario de Nuestra Se√±ora de las Nieves</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Sanctuary of Our Lady of the Snows</ENAMEX>). This holds the venerated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14th-century</TIMEX> terracotta image of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Virgen de las Nieves</ENAMEX>, which relates to an ancient miracle when the Virgin appeared in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August</TIMEX> snow. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Every five years</TIMEX> the image is carried to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Cruz</ENAMEX> in a procession known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">La Bajada de la Virgen</ENAMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Descent</ENAMEX> of the Virgin).
The next place of interest is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Centro de Visitantes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Visitors Center</ENAMEX>) of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parque Nacional de la Caldera de Taburiente</ENAMEX>, located at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Km 23.9</TIMEX> on road <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TF-812</ENAMEX>, (open <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9am‚Äì2pm and 4pm‚Äì6:30pm</TIMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> brochure is quite helpful, giving general information on the geology and geomorphology, <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flora</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">fauna</ENAMEX>, helpful hints on camping as well as a very useful color diagram of the hiking possibilities. At the heart of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">La Palma</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Caldera de Taburiente</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>, covering <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4,690 hectares</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">just over 18 square miles</NUMEX>), is a giant crater: 1,500 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,640 yards</NUMEX>) deep with a diameter of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6.2 miles</NUMEX>), and is a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">12.4 miles</NUMEX>) in circumference. It was created <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 400,000</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX> and has since been colonized by nature into a green, fertile valley. The best place to see this is from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mirador La Cumbrecita</ENAMEX>, which is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">7 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">nearly 5 miles</NUMEX>) away on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> next to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>. Following it, the road finally climbs into a craggy forest surrounded by mist-shrouded peaks with tall pines clinging to the most precarious ledges. There are wonderful views from here (weather permitting¬†‚Äî¬†which it doesn‚Äôt most of the time), including the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roque de los Muchachos</ENAMEX> and the monolithic <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roque Idafe</ENAMEX>, said to have been the sacred altar of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Guanche</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">natives</ENAMEX> on the island. You can enjoy the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caldera</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>, but to get the most from the area you have to walk.
The main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> then continues west through the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los Llanos de Aridane</ENAMEX> and then turns south, following the mountainside, to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fuencaliente</ENAMEX>. The most southerly point on the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>, it is famous for its <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wines</ENAMEX>. But rather than continue directly back north on the eastern side of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">La Palma</ENAMEX>, take the road down to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Faro de Fuencaliente</ENAMEX> that will lead you in a near circle to the most southern tip of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">La Palma</ENAMEX> and then up through a winding, twisting, road back to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fuencaliente</ENAMEX>. The first stop is at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bodegas Carballo</ENAMEX>, where you can sample and purchase some surprisingly strong local <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wines</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1677</TIMEX> the local volcano, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Antonio</ENAMEX>, erupted covering once fertile land with ash, leaving a layer of lapilli <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">approximately 2 m</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">6.5 ft</NUMEX>) deep. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of that century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX> had developed a technique of digging trenches that enabled them to reach the fertile layer of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">earth</ENAMEX> found under the cinders, where they planted the vines that were then covered with the extracted ashes. This somehow allowed the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> to resist adverse weather conditions and even the grape plague, phylloxera, that decimated vines all over <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the second half of the 19th century</TIMEX>. Just across the road you can stop to pay a visit to the edge of the volcanic crater of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Volc√°n de San Antonio</ENAMEX> and the mirador beyond it, (open <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily 8am‚Äì6pm</TIMEX>). In an exposed, windy location this looks, considering the damage it did, exceedingly benign. Just south of here are even more recent signs of volcanic activity; the volcano of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tenegu√</ENAMEX>≠a that erupted in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1971</TIMEX>, fortunately without casualties. These eruptions sent an ever-widening stream of molten lava rushing down the green hillside here and you can see it now, petrified and black, as the road runs right through the once deadly mass. Surprisingly, pl√°tanos (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bananas</ENAMEX>) seem to take a liking to this environment, and can be seen thriving all around you. Once down to sea level you will come across the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Playa de Zamora</ENAMEX> a small beach of jet-black sand squeezed in between the surrealistic lava fields. A short distance away, next to the twin <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lighthouses¬†‚Äî¬†one</ENAMEX> old and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> new¬†‚Äî¬†is a tiny fishermen‚Äôs cove with a stony beach that has a tiny <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX>, well, a shack really, that serves up the most delicious fresh fried <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">139</NUMEX>). After that there is nothing of note, except of course the lava fields and views, until you rejoin the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fuencaliente</ENAMEX>.
Heading back north towards <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Cruz</ENAMEX>, a stop at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cueva de Belmaco</ENAMEX> is in order. Here, you will find the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parque Arqueol√≥gico de Belmaco</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Archaeological Site of Belmaco</ENAMEX>). The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stone engravings</ENAMEX> found in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canary Islands</ENAMEX> were discovered here in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 18th century</TIMEX>, and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cave</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dwellings</ENAMEX>, with their magnificent rock engravings, were the home to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Benahoritas¬†‚Äî¬†the</ENAMEX> ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">settlers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Benahoare</ENAMEX>, the original aboriginal name for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">La Palma</ENAMEX>.
The Northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Loop</ENAMEX>
This is really of little interest, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX> often leave something to be desired. However, a trip up the eastern coast from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Cruz</ENAMEX> to just south of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barlovento</ENAMEX> isn‚Äôt too long, and the rather serpentine road runs through some pretty scenery. Make the first stop the miradores of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bartolom√©</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Monta√±a</ENAMEX>, with the latter being a little higher and affording beautiful vistas along the coast in both directions. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Head</ENAMEX> next for the seaside village of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Andr√©s</ENAMEX> and its natural swimming <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pools</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Charco Azul</ENAMEX> (blue pool). A little inland from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Andr√©s</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Sauces</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Bosque de Los Tilos</ENAMEX>, the largest wooded area in the whole <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canary Islands</ENAMEX> and designated a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚ÄúBiosphere Reserve‚Äù</ENAMEX> under the protection of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UNESCO</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heritage of Mankind</ENAMEX> is the information <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> above the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX> (open <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Monday‚ÄìFriday 8am‚Äì3pm</ENAMEX>). The final destination though is a lovely, remote site just before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barlovento</ENAMEX> where, after a tortuously twisting journey down through banana <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plantations</ENAMEX>, you will reach the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Piscinas Fajana</ENAMEX>; literally swimming <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pools</ENAMEX> built into the rocks and fed by the ocean <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX> that often crash into them. Showers and toilets are on hand, as is the pleasant <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">La Gaviota</ENAMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seagull</ENAMEX>), a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX>, and the views north of the cliffs falling straight into the ocean and being pounded by waves are breathtaking.
The goal in the north for most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">travelers</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roque de los Muchachos</ENAMEX>, the highest point in the island at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,423</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">7,950 ft</NUMEX>) above sea level. There are several ways up to it, but always be aware of the weather; what looks fine from sea level takes on a different perspective at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly 2,438</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">8,000 ft</NUMEX>). And, of course, it can change dramatically and quickly, so go prepared clothes-wise, and know that you might not see much but clouds. Besides the views, the other attraction up here is the futuristic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Observatoria de Astrof√≠sica</ENAMEX>, regarded as the most important <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">observatory</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Northern Hemisphere</ENAMEX> and home to some of the world‚Äôs most important telescopes, including the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4-m</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">165-inch</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Herschel</ENAMEX> telescope. However, as it is only open to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few days each summer</TIMEX>, most will have to be satisfied with just seeing it from the outside.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PROVINCE OF LAS PALMAS de GRAN</ENAMEX> CANARIA:
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gran Canaria, Lanzarote</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fuerteventura</ENAMEX>(telephone code <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">928</NUMEX>):
Gran Canaria
Area: <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,533 sq km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">592 sq miles)¬†‚Äî¬</NUMEX>†the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> largest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Population</ENAMEX>: 715,000
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gran Canaria</ENAMEX> is second to none for its combination of perfect beaches and sophisticated nightlife, for its history and hubbub, marvelous natural scenery, sightseeing, and shopping. Almost circular in shape with a coastline of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">236 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">over 146 miles</NUMEX>), with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">over 50 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">31 miles</NUMEX>) occupied by diverse beaches, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gran Canaria</ENAMEX> is the classic volcanic cone in profile, and its mountainous character causes the climate to change radically with latitude and altitude. You can leave a wet and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">chilly</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Las Palmas</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an hour</TIMEX> later be enjoying a hot, sunny <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maspalomas</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gran Canaria</ENAMEX> is known, not without reason, as the ‚Äúcontinent in miniature.‚Äù The coastline ranges from awe-inspiring cliffs to golden dunes. Inland you can choose between stark mountains and tranquil valleys; in fact, there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX> protected areas that cover <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">42.7%</NUMEX> of the island‚Äôs surface.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las</ENAMEX> Palmas
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Bustling Las Palmas</ENAMEX>, (population <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">450,000¬†‚</NUMEX>Äî¬†the largest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canaries</ENAMEX> and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">seventh</NUMEX> largest in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>), is a major commercial and historical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cosmopolitan resort</ENAMEX>, and a vital seaport all rolled into one. It is one of the busiest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ports</ENAMEX> in the world.
The real <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">hub</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Las Palmas</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parque de Santa Catalina</ENAMEX>. This <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> is effectively one gigantic outdoor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">caf√</ENAMEX>© that buzzes day and night, and is just a short walk to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Playa de las Canteras</ENAMEX>. This superb golden beach stretches for <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 to 5 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 to 3 miles</NUMEX>) and a natural reef just offshore means that the water couldn‚Äôt be calmer. <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Las Canteras</ENAMEX> and the area behind it reflect the city‚Äôs cosmopolitan nature. Like the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> in general, it has seen better <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> and is losing younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourist</ENAMEX> trade to the smarter modern <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX> in the south.
Away from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Las Canteras</ENAMEX> make your first stop <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Doramas Parque</ENAMEX>, a pleasantly landscaped <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> named after a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Guanche</ENAMEX> island chieftain, and adjacent to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pueblo Canario</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canary Village</ENAMEX>). This is a romanticized version of a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canarian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> where you can shop for handicrafts and watch displays of folk dancing and singing. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who conceived it was local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">N√©stor de la Torre</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1888‚Äì1938</ENAMEX>), and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> of his exotic art is in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pueblo</ENAMEX>.
Further south is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Triana</ENAMEX>, one of the older barrios (suburbs). <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> it is known for its upmarket <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, and the long, pleasant, pedestrianized <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Calle</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mayor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Triana</ENAMEX> offers just about everything for both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locals</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adjoining Triana</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vegueta</ENAMEX>, the oldest part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> forces <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> set up <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camp</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1478</TIMEX>. History lurks behind every <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wall</ENAMEX> and this is a delightful place just to wander around. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher Columbus</ENAMEX> knew these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>, and he prayed at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ermita de San Antonio Abad</ENAMEX> before setting off on his first Voyage of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Discovery</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New World</ENAMEX>. The present <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> dates from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 18th century</TIMEX>. Close by on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calle Col√≥n</ENAMEX> is the beautiful <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Casa de Col√≥n</ENAMEX>; this elegant <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> with its charming <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX> was formerly the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX> of the island‚Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Columbus</ENAMEX> is said to have stayed here on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> occasions. Now an atmospheric <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>, it recreates the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Age</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Discovery</ENAMEX> with exhibits of navigational instruments, charts, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX>, and everyday items of the period.
Around the corner stands the vast <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gothic</ENAMEX> and neo-<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Classic</ENAMEX> bulk of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Catedral de Santa Ana</ENAMEX>, with its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diocesan Museum of Sacred Art</ENAMEX>, which is not pretty but certainly impressive, and best seen by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">floodlighting</ENAMEX> softens its harsh, grimy front. Facing the cathedral are several green bronze statues of the aboriginal mastiff <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> after whom the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canary Islands</ENAMEX> are said to have been named (from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> canes).
Just down from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">cathedral</ENAMEX> is the modernistic <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Centro Atlantico de Arte Moderno</ENAMEX> (CAAM); (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atlantic Center of Modern Art</ENAMEX>). With <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floors</ENAMEX> of exhibitions, this is the southernmost contemporary art <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Union</ENAMEX> and focuses on the work of young <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canarian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">creators</ENAMEX>. Nearby the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museo Canario</ENAMEX> holds the islands‚Äô most important collection from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Guanche</ENAMEX> times, with the highlight being the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> of skulls and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mummies</ENAMEX>, depicting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guanches‚</ENAMEX>Äô fascination with death (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>).
The hills surrounding here, and on the southern approach to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Las Palmas</ENAMEX>, are full of apartment <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> and the like, and would not normally merit any attention. However, the city <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> readily realized that these areas looked, at the very least, rather bland. To counteract this they had the ingenuity to brighten them up; and nowadays all the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> are painted in the most unusual, and very attractive, array of pastel colors.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern Exposure</ENAMEX>
The southern <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Agust√≠n</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Playa del Ingl√©s</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maspalomas</ENAMEX>, the biggest holiday <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> in all of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>, let alone the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canaries</ENAMEX>, are linked to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Las Palmas and Gran Canaria international</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX> by the fast and featureless autopista (motorway).
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">San Agust√</ENAMEX>≠n is a restrained area of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartments</ENAMEX>, catering for more mature and discerning <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vacationers</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Playa del Ingl√</ENAMEX>©s is more robust, as the very name (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beach</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX>) might suggest, although it attracts numerous <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> as well. This is a fun-and-sun sprawling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> of high-rise <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX>, shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">malls</ENAMEX>, and fast-food <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>. The nightlife at the more than numerous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">discos</ENAMEX>, bars and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clubs</ENAMEX> can be hectic. During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> can sun themselves on the golden beaches that stretch for <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">16 featureless kilometers</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 miles</NUMEX>), so there is room enough for everyone. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maspalomas</ENAMEX> is famous for its dunes that cover an wide area of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">250 hectares</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">618 acres</NUMEX>), which are sufficiently large and unspoiled to constitute a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mini-Sahara</ENAMEX> of great beauty. They are a protected nature reserve, but you are far more likely to see naturists than naturalists here. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Playa de Maspalomas</ENAMEX> is the stretch of dunes close to the landmark lighthouse and is home to a small, but ever growing, number of top-class <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX>.
As you might expect, there is the usual plethora of family attractions nearby, the most important of which is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palmitos Parque</ENAMEX>, that provides an excellent day out for all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>. Performing parrots amuse with circus tricks, and caged <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> of every imaginable hue are kept in beautiful gardens. The real <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stars</ENAMEX>, however, are the exotic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">free-flying residents</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AquaSur</ENAMEX> is, at <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">130,000 square m</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">over 32 acres</NUMEX>), the largest waterpark in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canary Islands</ENAMEX>. The other major attraction, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sioux City</ENAMEX>, is a recreation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wild West</ENAMEX>, with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">gun</ENAMEX>-fights, lynchings, saloon gals and lassooing tricks, etc. <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Friday evening Big Wild West Show</ENAMEX> (with barbecue) is great fun for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">West of Maspalomas</ENAMEX> the coastline becomes dominated by towering, rather barren looking cliffs, that every <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">now</TIMEX> and again form natural bays and coves well-suited to become <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX> in their own right. However, this area is overdeveloped; what is surprising is that development continues apace, especially given the lack of building <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">space</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Developers</ENAMEX>, however, have resolved this problem very innovatively by literally <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> into the cliff <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sides</ENAMEX> themselves, and this often leaves <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> with the rather surreal sight of wall-to-wall development taking up every inch of these steep bays. Nevertheless, some of the places retain a certain charm.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX> is the most attractive beach <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> on this coast. But it too has been grossly overdeveloped, so its lovely, sheltered, golden beach can become unbearably crowded. Its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">marina</ENAMEX> is the focal point for numerous marine adventures that will suit all tastes. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L√≠neas Salm√≥n</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> and runs a frequent and inexpensive ferry service between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arguinegu√≠n</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mog√°n</ENAMEX>, offering a charming way of getting to know this part of the coastline. Afriyachts, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> catamarans that run <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five-hour</TIMEX> cruises. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dolphin</ENAMEX> cruises are popular too, and glass bottom <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> operate from the port. Sport fishing will appeal to the more adventurous, and this part of the coast is just the place for it; consequently, numerous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> operate from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Puerto de Mog√</ENAMEX>°n should be a lesson to all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort developers</ENAMEX> in how to provide accommodation that is functional, very attractive and totally in sympathy with its surroundings. The accommodation here is an interpretation of local <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">townhouses</ENAMEX> that are ablaze with bougainvillea, arranged in pedestrian<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">-only</NUMEX> squares with narrow alleyways and arches leading to an attractive marina. This is lined with stylish caf√©s and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, jazz and piano bars, and small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boutiques</ENAMEX>. All that is lacking is a good beach. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">submarine</ENAMEX> trip also dives from here, and one of the best nautical trips is an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">excursion</ENAMEX> aboard the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Windjammer San Miguel</ENAMEX>, a fine old transatlantic sailing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ship</ENAMEX> built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1919</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Northern Coast</ENAMEX> and Hinterland
Arucas, is a workaday town overshadowed by an immense <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">neo-Gothic cathedral</ENAMEX> that stands out like a sore thumb. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> west from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arucas</ENAMEX> follows a truly dizzying route through the mountains past several caves. Some provide <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shelter</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">goats</ENAMEX>, but others are inhabited by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and are complete with running <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> and electricity. The route passes through the tidy small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moya</ENAMEX>. It is well worth stopping to see its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>, precariously perched on the very edge of a ravine. An act of faith indeed!
Just off the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">coast</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cenobio de Valer√≥n</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Convent of Valer√≥n</ENAMEX>). This is badly sign-posted. Take the turn off just before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gu√≠a</ENAMEX>, away from the sea. This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">convent</ENAMEX> is actually a series of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guanche</ENAMEX> caves cut into a steep mountainside. According to island lore, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughters</ENAMEX> of noble <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> spent their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youth</ENAMEX> in these small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> serving the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">native gods</ENAMEX>. At the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age of 15</TIMEX> they were allowed to marry or to remain in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">sanctuary</ENAMEX> for life. More prosaically, the caves were probably also used for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">grain</ENAMEX> storage. Around this area, you could spy some modern <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cave dwellers</ENAMEX>.
Continue south towards <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Agaete</ENAMEX>, which is the most attractive of the small northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX>. Agaete‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto de las Nieves</ENAMEX>, is a haven of calm among the formidable rocky cliffs that make up this inhospitable stretch of coast. From here the coast road ascends very sharply amid sparse, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">windblown greenery</ENAMEX>, and the drop seawards can be frighteningly steep. An alternative route is to drive <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">7 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4 miles</NUMEX>) inland to the fine viewpoint at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Los Berrazales</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central Sights</ENAMEX>
The mountainous center of the island makes for very tiring driving. You will rarely get out of the lower gears, but the wonderful panoramas are ample reward. <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">Pine forests</ENAMEX>, almond groves, gnarled mountains, sheer cliffs, and cloudy mountaintops beckon.
The best and certainly the most popular vantage point is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cruz de Tejeda</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cross</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tejeda)¬†‚Äî¬†at 1,463 m</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4,800 ft</NUMEX>), one of the few points inland where you are almost guaranteed to meet fellow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX>. A small cluster of caf√©s, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX> and souvenir <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stalls</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donkeys</ENAMEX> await you at the summit. The magnificent panorama includes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> rock formations that were once worshipped by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guanches</ENAMEX>. The most distinctive is the statuesque, dark, broody bulk of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roque Nublo</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,817</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5,961 ft</NUMEX>), and it takes little imagination to understand the primitive inhabitants‚Äô fascination with this formation; the other is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roque Bentaiga</ENAMEX>.
As the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cruz de Tejeda</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">hub</ENAMEX> of the island, there are any number of routes to and from it and almost all have something to offer, so consider ascending on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> route and descending via another.
From <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Las Palmas</ENAMEX> you have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> options. The most northern route runs through the peaceful valley <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Teror</ENAMEX>. The old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">whitewashed houses</ENAMEX>, often built around graceful patios, boast fine traditional carved <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">balconies</ENAMEX>. The major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">landmark</ENAMEX> here is a typically large <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canarian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bas√≠lica Nuestra Se√±ora del Pino</ENAMEX> (Our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lady</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pine</ENAMEX>). This commemorates the miraculous discovery in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1481</TIMEX>, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branches</ENAMEX> of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">pine tree</ENAMEX>, of a sacred effigy. The Blessed Virgin of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Teror</ENAMEX> is also the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patron saint</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gran Canaria</ENAMEX>. Alternatively, take the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> that runs inland from close to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">cathedral</ENAMEX> and heads southwest through the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Br√≠gida</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Vega de</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Mateo</ENAMEX>, offering panoramic views of the east of the island. Because the climate here is exceptionally mild, many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canarians</ENAMEX> and foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> have built very desirable <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> in these hills, with the gardens around their villas often being magnificent. A small diversion along this route is certainly worthwhile. Just <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a few kilometers</NUMEX> out of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Las Palmas</ENAMEX>, follow the signs to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bandama</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> (open <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">8am‚Äì10pm</NUMEX>) leads up to the nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Caldera de Bandama</ENAMEX>, one of the island‚Äôs finest natural features and a spectacular mirador in its own right. This volcanic crater, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">almost a kilometer</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">more than a half mile</NUMEX>) across, is green, fertile.and drops <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 198</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">650 ft</ENAMEX>) down. A scenic spiraling road leads to the top, where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Real Club de Golf</ENAMEX> enjoys such a picturesque location that even non-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">golfers</ENAMEX> are tempted to pick up a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">club</ENAMEX>. The views from here take in the mountains, fertile valley and vast stretches of the coastline from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Las Palmas</ENAMEX> to the distant south.
From the west of the island drive north from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agaete</ENAMEX> and then turn inland following the signs to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tejeda</ENAMEX> for a really pleasant, and not unduly difficult, mountain ascent. The valleys here are wide and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">slopes</ENAMEX> play host to some small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">farms</ENAMEX>; it is one of the few places in the islands where you will come across farm <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>. Of interest, too, are the fantastic views across the ocean on a fine day to the snowcapped <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mount Teide</ENAMEX> floating majestically above the clouds and the mountain peaks and lush valleys of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gran Canaria</ENAMEX> itself. Before reaching <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tejeda</ENAMEX> turn off to the village of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Artenara</ENAMEX>, to the southwest, and what is undoubtedly the best restaurant view on the island. The place in question is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M√©son de la Silla</ENAMEX>, not easy to spot, parallel to the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>. A dark tunnel leads through the rock with no hint of what is to come, then emerges on the other side of the mountain to a bright <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">180</NUMEX>-degree mountain <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">panorama</ENAMEX>. To the left the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of the valley, green and dotted with whitewashed little <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX>; it leads up to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tejeda</ENAMEX> itself, but the more dramatic vistas are directly in front and to the right. Here, the scenario is dramatic indeed; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">jagged</TIMEX> peaks fill the horizon and many smaller ones are spread throughout the valley giving the impression of looking down on a minor mountain range.
Lanzarote
Area: <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">803 sq km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">310 sq miles)¬†‚Äî¬</NUMEX>†the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> largest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Population</ENAMEX>: 77,000
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lanzarote</ENAMEX> is a startling place, representing the triumph of civilization over a hostile environment, and the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> has been declared a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Biosphere Reserve</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UNESCO</ENAMEX>. Its pock-marked, lunar-like surface, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">60 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">37 miles</NUMEX>) long and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">121/2 miles</NUMEX>) wide, is dotted with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 300</NUMEX> volcanoes, yet onions, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">potatoes</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tomatoes</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">melons</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">grapes</ENAMEX> all spring in abundance from the black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ash</ENAMEX>. Its most unusual farm <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crop</ENAMEX>, however, is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cochineal Beetle</ENAMEX> that, when squashed, emits a red dye used as coloring for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campari</ENAMEX> and lipsticks. Newer to the tourist scene than either <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Gran Canaria</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tenerife</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lanzarote</ENAMEX> seems to have learned from the excesses of its sister islands. Here, small is beautiful and harmony with the environment is the philosophy.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South ofthe Island</ENAMEX>
Arrecife, the principal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX> and latter-day capital is a characterless place with just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> saving graces¬<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">†‚Äî¬†the Castillo de San Gabriel</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Castillo de San Jos√©</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">The 16th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Castillo de San Gabriel</ENAMEX>, situated close to the center of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, houses a small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> of no great standing. But it is worth the walk across the small drawbridge and over the lagoon, onto the small island that the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> used to deter <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pirates</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Castillo de San Jos√©</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a few kilometers</NUMEX>, to the north, is a far more interesting proposition. Built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 18th century</TIMEX>, this well-preserved fortress that once guarded the harbor it overlooks, now houses the late <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">C√©sar Manrique‚Äôs</ENAMEX> small but impressive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Museum of Contemporary Art</ENAMEX>. This includes works by <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Picasso and Mir√≥</ENAMEX>, and is also notable for the contrast between the modern exhibits and the ancient structure that houses them.
The island‚Äôs major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto del Carmen</ENAMEX> and its long golden beach stretches for <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 5 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 miles</NUMEX>) and comfortably accommodates its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">sea</ENAMEX> is calm and ideal for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Restaurants</ENAMEX> of every conceivable type, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> line the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avenida de las Playas, Lanzarote‚</ENAMEX>Äôs one outbreak of mass commercialism.
The old town <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">just</NUMEX> west of the beach has a charming small harbor area with traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bars</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> and an array of marine adventures awaiting you. Of these, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blue Delfin</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Princesa Ico</ENAMEX>, both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glass bottomed catamarans</ENAMEX>, offer a variety of trips, sport fishing charters leave from here also. If you prefer seeing the area from the air, albeit attached to a motorboat, then <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paracraft</ENAMEX> offers you the chance to paraglide.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> west leads through the beautifully tended village of to the rather more earthy <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salinas de Janubio</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Salt Flats</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Janubio</ENAMEX>). <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Every spring</TIMEX>, for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corpus Christi</ENAMEX> festivities, the flats provide the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX> that local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> dye into a variety of colors and pour onto the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arrecife</ENAMEX> to create religious and secular designs (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX>). A little farther north are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> more natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spectacles</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Hervideros</ENAMEX> is a section of rocky coast where the crashing waves break ferociously against the cliffs and sea caves. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Golfo</ENAMEX>, by contrast, is a placid, emerald-green lagoon set beside a cliff that resembles a gigantic petrified tidal wave just about to break. This is actually the inner rim of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">volcanic cone</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of which has disappeared beneath the sea. The strata, colors, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">manic whirls</ENAMEX> are a fascinating sight. Note that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Golfo</ENAMEX> is not apparent from the roadside. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Park</ENAMEX> your <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> on the rough <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ledge</ENAMEX>, just off the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> on the left as you begin the descent into the village of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Golfo</ENAMEX> (renowned for the quality of its <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>), and follow the rough footpath over the cliff.
The newly created <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Playa Blanca</ENAMEX> on the south coast, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> major tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">center</ENAMEX> on the island, is host to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fuerteventura</ENAMEX> ferry, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">marina</ENAMEX> and a good golden beach. However, just <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a few miles</NUMEX> east along unpaved <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX> are the best <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sands</ENAMEX> on the island, collectively known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Papagayo</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">parrot</ENAMEX>) beaches. You will need a four-wheel-drive <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicle</ENAMEX>, local directions (there are no signposts), and little else, as on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Papagayo</ENAMEX> naturism is the norm. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ganges Seis</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">taxi boat</ENAMEX> that will drop you off there in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX> and return to pick you up in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the afternoon</TIMEX>. An alternate way to get there is to take the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Catlanza s.l.</ENAMEX> a modern <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">catamaran</ENAMEX> that sails out of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Calero¬</ENAMEX>†‚Äî¬†the highlight is when it drops anchor <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">46 m</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 yards</NUMEX>) off the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Papagayo</ENAMEX> beach.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Puerto Calero</ENAMEX>, just <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a few minutes</TIMEX> south of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto del Carmen</ENAMEX>, but with an entirely different ambiance, is a rather new and dominated by its modern marina that is lined by a row of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> offering all kinds of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cuisine</ENAMEX>. Besides the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Catlanza</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">catamaran</ENAMEX> it is also the home <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Submarine Safaris</ENAMEX> which offers the opportunity to explore under the local waters. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">The trip</ENAMEX> that lasts <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one hour</TIMEX>, and when it settles onto the seabed <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 m</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">33 yards</NUMEX>) or so down, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">divers</ENAMEX> go out to feed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>.
The highlight of your trip to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lanzarote</ENAMEX> and the magical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ingredient</ENAMEX> that makes this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> so special is to be found in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monta√±as del Fuego</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mountains of Fire</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parque Nacional de Timanfaya</ENAMEX>, which encompasses the mountains in its <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">200 square km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">77.2 square miles</NUMEX>), starts just north of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yaiza</ENAMEX>, and its boundary is marked by an impish devil motif. This desolate national <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> was formed largely over the course of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16 cataclysmic months</TIMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1730 and 1731</TIMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Eleven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> were buried <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">forever</TIMEX> and many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> left the island for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gran Canaria</ENAMEX>.
Drive on and turn left at the small roundabout to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monta√±as del Fuego</ENAMEX>. Your introduction to the inner sanctum of the mountains leaves no doubt that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> of these volcanoes (in fact the very one that you are standing on!) is not dead, just sleeping. In fact, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">less than 10 m</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX> ft) under the surface the temperature reaches <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as much as 600¬∫</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1,112¬∫F</NUMEX>), and at the surface level it can, at certain places, get to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">120¬∫ C</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">248¬∫F</NUMEX>). A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guide</ENAMEX> demonstrates this by pouring <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> down a tube into the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">earth</ENAMEX>, then beating a hasty retreat. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Seconds later</TIMEX> a geyser erupts, startling the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diners</ENAMEX> in the adjacent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">Cars</ENAMEX> are not allowed any farther into the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>, and from here <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coach</ENAMEX> tours¬†‚Äî¬†included in the admission price, depart to explore the incredible landscape. Any badlands that you may have seen up to this point have been a mere appetizer for the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">course</ENAMEX>. The words lunar and alien are worked to exhaustion in attempts to describe the area, and still scarcely do justice to the dramatic scenery. This was caused by a massive eruption (the volcano was active from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 1730 to April 1736</TIMEX>), during which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">420</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> were completely destroyed. The last activity of the volcano began in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1824</TIMEX> and lasted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 years</TIMEX>.
With <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rain</ENAMEX> so rare and underground water sources extremely limited you may wonder how <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lanzarote</ENAMEX> manages to survive as an agricultural <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX>. The black topsoil is the secret, discovered by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX> in their adversity. The porous volcanic particles that make up the topsoil are useless in themselves but act as a sponge for the moisture of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the night</TIMEX> air, obtaining <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> and eliminating the need for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rain</ENAMEX>. They are therefore piled on top of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crops</ENAMEX> and only need replacing around once every <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20 years</TIMEX>. The other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canary Islands</ENAMEX> also use this method.
The most impressive example of this type of farming is the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">vineyards</ENAMEX> around the valley of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Geria</ENAMEX>. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">vine</ENAMEX> is set in its own <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mini-crater</ENAMEX>, protected from wind and excess sun by a low semi-circular wall of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lava stones</ENAMEX> (other <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crops</ENAMEX> are also protected in this manner). The horseshoe patterns thus formed stretch way up the mountains and apparently into infinity, producing an almost hypnotic effect. Not only do the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">vineyards</ENAMEX> look good, the end product also tastes very good, and there are several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bodegas</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Geria valley</ENAMEX> where you can sample the excellent local malvas√≠a. Those with an interest in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> will want to pay a visit to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museo del Vino de Lanzarote</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Grifo</ENAMEX>; not too far away at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">San Bartolom√© de Lanzarote</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monument</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Grifo</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manrique</ENAMEX> creation, adorns the entrance to this bodega that has been producing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wines</ENAMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 18th century</TIMEX>. It is the oldest in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canaries</ENAMEX>. Enjoy the exhibitions of wine-making tools, stroll through the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">vineyards</ENAMEX> and, of course, partake of the wine tasting sessions.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North of the Island</ENAMEX>
On an island so dominated by the works and creativity of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>, it would be inappropriate not to pay a visit to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fundaci√≥n C√©sar Manrique; Taro de Tahiche; Manrique</ENAMEX> lived here and, as you might have come to expect, it is rather unusual. Built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1968</TIMEX>, it is located over a river of lava formed from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">eruptions</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1730 and 1736</TIMEX> and takes advantage, at its lowest point, of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> volcanic bubbles to create the strange, but nonetheless impressive living space.
The geographic center of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lanzarote</ENAMEX> lies <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">9 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">51‚ÅÑ2 miles</NUMEX>) northwest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mozaga</ENAMEX>, focal point of the island‚Äôs viniculture. Here the late <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">C√©sar Manrique</ENAMEX> designed and erected a huge white modern sculpture, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monumento al Campesino</ENAMEX>, dedicated to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peasant workers</ENAMEX> of the island.
<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">A few miles</NUMEX> north of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">La Santa</ENAMEX>, home to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Club La Santa</ENAMEX> a time-share development <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">athletes</ENAMEX> of the highest level come for both training and relaxation, is the tiny <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caleta de Famara</ENAMEX>. It has windswept beaches with views of the daunting cliffs of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Famara Massif</ENAMEX> that lead up to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mirador del R√≠o</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Graciosa</ENAMEX> island. There is not much to do along this coastline except sunbathe and windsurf, but as the currents can be dangerous here, be sure to take care.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Teguise</ENAMEX> is a fine old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of cobbled <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> and gracious <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansions</ENAMEX> and was the island <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1852</TIMEX>. Now it is calm and quiet for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six days of the week</TIMEX>. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sundays</TIMEX> a handicrafts market comes to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> where you can buy a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">timple¬†‚Äî¬†a</ENAMEX> small ukulele-like instrument used by local folkloric <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">musicians</ENAMEX>. Several of its old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> have been converted to craft and antique <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>. Overlooking the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Castillo de</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa B√°rbara</ENAMEX>. The views from this wind-blown point are worth the trip alone. High on top of the extinct volcano of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guanapay</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> now hosts the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museo del Emigrante Canario</ENAMEX>, where sepia photos and nostalgic exhibits tell the sad story of how mass emigration to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South America</ENAMEX> was the only option left for many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canarian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Costa Teguise</ENAMEX>, just north of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arrecife</ENAMEX>, is a totally modern <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX>, comprising several urbanizaci√≥nes with time-shares, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartments</ENAMEX> designed for a wealthy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clientele</ENAMEX>. It is no surprise to realize that the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">King</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Queen</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> have an official <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX> here, and it is where they welcomed the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Milennium</ENAMEX>. There is a handful of good sandy beaches, particularly <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Playa de las Cucharas</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> sports thrive and windsurfing is particularly popular. Look for the championship <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">golf course</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ocean Park Water Park</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">coast</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> east passes the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guatiza</ENAMEX>, where prickly <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">pears</ENAMEX> abound and where cochineal beetles are still cultivated (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C√©sar Manrique</ENAMEX> also cultivated the spiny <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flora</ENAMEX> into a beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jard√≠n de Cactus</ENAMEX> complete with a working windmill that produces its own gofio (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>). There is more <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Manrique</ENAMEX> design to admire at the caves of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jameos del Agua</ENAMEX>; opened in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1966</TIMEX>, this was the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> attraction designed by the great <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">creator</ENAMEX>, where his landscaping talents have embellished and transformed a grotto and underground lagoon into a short fantasy journey. Ethereal mood music accompanies your descent into the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">cave</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lushly</ENAMEX> planted with luxuriant foliage. Peer into the black lagoon and you can pick out the very rare, tiny blind albino crabs, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Munidopsis</ENAMEX> polymorpha, which live here. Resist, though, the temptation to throw coins into the crystal clear lagoon; the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attendant corrosion</ENAMEX> of the metal kills the crabs. Finally you emerge from the cave into a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Seas paradise</ENAMEX>, complete with its accompanying swimming pool. In <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the evening</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jameos del Agua</ENAMEX> is transformed into a night-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">club</ENAMEX> where folklore shows are regularly staged. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cueva de los Verdes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Green Caves</ENAMEX>) found a short distance away across the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>, are part of the same system, and were blasted through the earth by exploding lava. There is a guided tour that includes some memorable sound and light effects, evoking the menacing volcano most effectively.
At the northern tip of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> is the small fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Orzola</ENAMEX>. This is the embarkation point for the tiny <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Graciosa</ENAMEX>, a ferry service run by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L√≠neas Maritimas Romero</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> times <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a day</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">July‚ÄìSep</ENAMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the rest of the year</TIMEX>. With superb beaches and a complete lack of tourist development, this is the place to get away from it all for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX>.
For an unforgettable view of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Isla Graciosa</ENAMEX> and much more, drive up to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mirador del R√≠o</ENAMEX> (admission: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</NUMEX> ptas, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">r2.40</ENAMEX>). This is yet another of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C√©sar Manrique‚</ENAMEX>Äôs creations, and one that certainly shouldn‚Äôt be missed. The views from here really are wonderful indeed, and it is probably the most spectacular mirador in all the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canaries</ENAMEX>. Huge cliffs curve down to the beach with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Graciosa</ENAMEX> just across the water and with the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> other smaller islands, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Monta√±a Clara</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alegranza</ENAMEX>, in the background. Combined with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Graciosa</ENAMEX> and a small section of the northwest coastline of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lanzarote</ENAMEX>, they form the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parque Nacional del Archipi√©lago Chinijo</ENAMEX>. The only sound here is that of the wind gently whistling through <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El R√≠o</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">waterway</ENAMEX> separating <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lanzarote</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Graciosa</ENAMEX>. Besides its huge picture windows, note in the bar/restaurant some more of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manrique‚</ENAMEX>Äôs creative sculptures.
Another addition to the island‚Äôs burgeoning tourist attractions is the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Guinate Tropical Bird Park</ENAMEX>, just south of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mirador del R√≠o.</ENAMEX> Within its <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">45,000 square m</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">11.1 acres</NUMEX>) of carefully tended landscaped gardens you will find <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 1,300</NUMEX> species of rare and exotic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, a new area where you can discover the world of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Tamarind monkeys</ENAMEX>, and of course, performing parrots entertain in the theatre.
Fuerteventura
Area: <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2,020 sq km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">780 sq miles)¬†‚Äî¬</NUMEX>†the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> largest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Population</ENAMEX>: 42,000
Beaches on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fuerteventura</ENAMEX> still outnumber <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX>. At the last count there were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">152</NUMEX> beaches along the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">340 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">210 miles</NUMEX>) of coastline; <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">31 miles</NUMEX>) of which are of yellow <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sand</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">25 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">16 miles</NUMEX>) of black <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sand</ENAMEX> and stone, giving it the best selection of beaches in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canary Islands</ENAMEX>. Enhancing these even more, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fuerteventura‚</ENAMEX>Äôs coastal shelf allows for the existence of shallow transparent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX> that often acquire a beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">turquoise</ENAMEX> color. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> is situated <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">less than 115 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">71 miles</NUMEX>) off the coast of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Africa</ENAMEX>, and most of its <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sand</ENAMEX> is blown here from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sahara</ENAMEX>, giving a new meaning to the term ‚Äúdesert <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX>.‚Äù
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fuerteventura</ENAMEX> is barren and windswept almost to the point of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">desolation¬†‚Äî¬†or grandeur</ENAMEX>, depending on your point of view. So sparse is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> that the density, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">22 inhabitants per square km</NUMEX>, is the lowest of the islands. Goats survive better here than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and they outnumber the human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhabitants</ENAMEX>. However, the harsh terrain can only support so many <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">goats</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> survive for their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk</ENAMEX> and famous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Majorero cheese</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blanco</ENAMEX> (white) or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rojo</ENAMEX> (red) according to the color of the crust. A few lucky <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> are kept for breeding purposes but the rest are destined for the dinner table.
The wind whistles with great <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fuerteventura</ENAMEX> and may even have given the island its name, a corruption and inversion of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">el</ENAMEX> viento fuerte (the strong wind). However, it is a wind that seems to be bringing good fortune to the island, as the presence of so many windsurfers proves. With the growth of tourism the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> has become one of the world‚Äôs leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">windsurfing centers</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North</ENAMEX>
The once sleepy fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corralejo</ENAMEX> has been transformed into the busy <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lanzarote</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ferry terminal</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a bustling</NUMEX> resort popular with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX>. Although the old port <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">area</ENAMEX> still has colorful fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> and some good <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> is, in the main, somewhat less than inspiring and one of the least pleasant of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canary Islands</ENAMEX> favored by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX>.
There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> routes south to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto del Rosario</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FV-1</ENAMEX> follows the east coast of the island, and just <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a few minutes</TIMEX> from the center of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corralejo</ENAMEX> there are some magnificent, long white beaches and dunes stretching for some <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">30 square km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">12 square miles</NUMEX>). These, (along with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Isla de los Lobos</ENAMEX>), have been declared a national <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> and are popular with nudists. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> lies <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 miles</NUMEX>) offshore, and its beaches are even more secluded than those on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúmainland</ENAMEX>.‚Äù The fishing here is outstanding. Glass-bottomed ferry-<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> depart regularly from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Corralejo</ENAMEX>. The rest of the route to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto del Rosario</ENAMEX>, once named <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Cabras</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Port of the Goats</ENAMEX>) because in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 18th century</TIMEX> it was used mainly for the raising of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">goats</ENAMEX>, has nothing of interest for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> itself is a rather drab place.
The inland route south to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Puerto del Rosario</ENAMEX> follows the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">FV-101</ENAMEX> and a diversion, west along the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">FV-109</ENAMEX> will bring you first to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Zoo Safari Calder√≥n Hondo</ENAMEX>. There you can opt for either <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a half-hour</TIMEX> camel trip or a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">11‚ÅÑ2 hour</TIMEX> safari to the lunar landscape of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Volcano Calder√≥n Hondo</ENAMEX>. Next comes the lace-making <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lajares</ENAMEX>. And if you really want to get away from it all, continue on to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Cotillo</ENAMEX>. This tiny fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">east coast</ENAMEX> also boasts some excellent beaches¬†wonderful for windsurfing, plus a handful of local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX> and some basic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>. Heading back south from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Cotillo</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">FV-10</ENAMEX> rejoins the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">FV-101</ENAMEX> at the small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Oliva</ENAMEX>. This is not especially attractive but it does feature <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">places</ENAMEX> of interest. Just off the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> stands the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Casa de los Coroneles</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House of the Colonels</ENAMEX>). Its name derives from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">its 18th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tenants</ENAMEX> who once ruled the island. The decaying, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cream</ENAMEX>-colored <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> still exudes a certain haughty, if melancholy, grandeur. By contrast, the nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Centro de Arte Canario</ENAMEX> is bright and modern, exhibiting the works of some of the finest living <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canarian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX>.
A little further south, just past <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tindaya</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> makes a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX>-leg towards <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Puerto</ENAMEX> in the east, and if you look very carefully to your right you will see, at the base of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the mountains, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monumento</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Don Miguel de Unamuno</ENAMEX>. Unamuno, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice-chancellor</ENAMEX> of the famous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Salamanca</ENAMEX>, the oldest in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>, made himself unpopular in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1924</TIMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dictator</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Primo de Ribera</ENAMEX>. His criticisms of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dictator</ENAMEX> resulted in his being exiled to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fuerteventura</ENAMEX>. Although he fled to the somewhat more civilized <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few months</TIMEX>, he loved to describe the beauty of the islands in his writing. His most famous quote states that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canaries</ENAMEX> were ‚Äúan <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">oasis</ENAMEX> in the desert of civilization.‚Äù
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Central Area</ENAMEX>
The central mountain range is encircled by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX>: the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">FV-20</ENAMEX> that initially heads west from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto del</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosario</ENAMEX> then drops south alongside the mountains to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Antigua</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tuineje</ENAMEX> before meeting up with the main north to south <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">FV-2</ENAMEX> just north of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gran Tarajal</ENAMEX>; and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">FV-30</ENAMEX> that loops around, off the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">FV-20</ENAMEX> north of the range, dropping into the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Betancuria valley</ENAMEX> and continuing south through winding terrain to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P√°jara</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tuinije</ENAMEX>, where it meets up again with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">FV-20</ENAMEX>. As you can join this loop from the north, south or <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>, and even cut across the mountains at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> point, you can start out from most parts of the island. Starting from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto del</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosario</ENAMEX> take the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">FV-30</ENAMEX> diversion off the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">FV-20</ENAMEX> and follow it until you see the signs for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mirador de Morro Velosa</ENAMEX>; soon a gate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> will demand <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">300 ptas</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">r1.80</NUMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>, but this will prove to be a worthwhile investment. At the summit and with commanding views of the surrounding mountains and with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic Ocean</ENAMEX> shimmering in the distance, is a delightful combination of caf√©, bar and viewpoint that owes its creative design to none other than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C√©sar Manrique</ENAMEX>.
Betancuria, by far the most attractive and visited inland <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> on the island, is an oasis of greenery on this barren island. Although the riverbed here is almost perpetually dry, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> is fortunate to have a high water table. Because of its theoretical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">invulnerability</ENAMEX> at the heart of the island, it was made <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fuerteventura‚Äôs</ENAMEX> first <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 15th century</TIMEX>. However, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1539</TIMEX> somehow the ravaging <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Berber</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pirates</ENAMEX> overcame the mountains (which still provide a difficult drive <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>), and destroyed the original cathedral. The present <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iglesia de Santa Mar√</ENAMEX>≠a is a splendid <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hosts</ENAMEX> many interesting treasures. Look at the unusual wooden beams between the flagstones on the floor, the wooden altar and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">choir</ENAMEX>, and the decorated pulpit. Adjacent to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">leather</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factory</ENAMEX>-cum-shoe<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">-shop</ENAMEX>, set in an atmospheric old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>. Wander round this lovely little <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> and admire the view from across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX>, where there is an unpretentious restaurant/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX> and a gift <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop</ENAMEX>. Just south of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Betancuria</ENAMEX> is the neat and pretty village of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P√°jara</ENAMEX>, but a stop at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Antigua</ENAMEX>, on the other side of the mountains is in order. This is reached either by continuing on the loop past <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tuineje</ENAMEX>, or backtracking from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Betancuria</ENAMEX> and taking the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">FV-416</ENAMEX> across the mountains. In either event, once in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Antigua¬</ENAMEX>†‚Äî the island‚Äôs capital from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1834‚Äì1835¬†‚Äî¬†you</NUMEX> can‚Äôt miss the traditional old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">windmill</ENAMEX> found just to the north of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, and this is your destination. Actually, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Centro de Artesania ‚ÄúMolino de Antigua‚Äù</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Windmill Crafts Center</ENAMEX>) is much more than just that, and has something for almost everyone‚Äôs tastes. Interesting crafts and a visit inside the windmill certainly, but also ethnographic and archaeological exhibitions, modern art, an audiovisual <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>, rooftop view- points and an intriguing cactus garden, not to mention a nice <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX>.
Of the coastline south of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto del Rosario</ENAMEX>, the new cosmopolitan development of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">El Castillo</ENAMEX>, also known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caleta de Fuste</ENAMEX>, is of most interest. Activities here focus around the attractive, horseshoe-shaped beach (where windsurfing is a particularly popular sport), and the well-designed marina. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">marina</ENAMEX>, there is an area where you can view the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> that frequent its <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX>, and a small number of activities use the harbor as a homeport. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oceanarium</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">catamaran</ENAMEX> that will take you out to visit the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dolphins</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">whales</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Nautilus</ENAMEX> is a semi-submersible <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">submarine</ENAMEX> that has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">twenty</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> seats.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South</ENAMEX>
The main attraction is the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">26-km-</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">16-mile-</NUMEX>) long sandy shores of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jand√</ENAMEX>≠a that run from the narrowest part of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fuerteventura</ENAMEX> down to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morro Jable</ENAMEX>. At the northern tip of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jand√</ENAMEX>≠a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sands</ENAMEX> are the beautiful beaches of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Costa Calma</ENAMEX>, not blighted as yet by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-development. Here, a low cliff backing and a scattering of rocks and coves give the beach far more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> than some of the seemingly endless stretches farther south.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Playa de Sotavento</ENAMEX> is world-famous as a windsurfing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>, with activity focused on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">F2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sol Elite</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gorriones Hotel</ENAMEX>. This has one of the best, and most isolated beach locations in all of the islands. Here the beach is very wide and flat, usually empty and, as the tides go out, also very wet. The dunes behind and a little farther to the south form an idyllic beach backdrop. Urbanizaciones spread relentlessly all the way down the coast to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morro Jable</ENAMEX>, which has some similarities with its northern <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Corralejo</ENAMEX>; both are <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ports</ENAMEX> and resorts, but in most other aspects are quite dissimilar. Whereas <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corralejo</ENAMEX> is flat, rather dingy, without many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> of much class, and doesn‚Äôt have much of its own beach, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morro Jable</ENAMEX>, built along the cliffs, is bright and airy, boasts numerous fine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, and has <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">miles</NUMEX> of wonderful beaches. It is interesting to note that while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corralejo</ENAMEX> is a mainly <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morro Jable</ENAMEX>, on the other hand, is frequented predominantly by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Germans</ENAMEX>. There are more fine beaches towards the southern tip of the island, but you will need a four-wheel-drive <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicle</ENAMEX> to get there. Jable, incidentally, is the name given to the huge quantities of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sands</ENAMEX> of organic origins that are frequently blown to the surrounding beaches. Windsurfing, obviously, is all the rage around here, and numerous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> operate in and around <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morro Jable</ENAMEX> and the other beaches of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jand√≠a.</ENAMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Diving Center F√©lix</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 Km {2 miles}</NUMEX> north of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morro Jable</ENAMEX>) offers dives and equipment rental. Consider <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Unisafari</ENAMEX>; based in either <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Jand√≠a</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Corralejo</ENAMEX>, whose professional guides will take you on a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">seven-hour</TIMEX> jeep safari to the most wild, least explored parts of the island.
