The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bahamas</ENAMEX> and the Bahamians
Like a handful of emeralds scattered across blue velvet, the verdant islands of the Commonwealth of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bahamas</ENAMEX> stretch across <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100,000 sq miles</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">259,000 sq km</NUMEX>) of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic Ocean</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">700</NUMEX> islands and numerous smaller cays (pronounced <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">â€œkeysâ€</ENAMEX>) that comprise this <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">semitropical archipelago</ENAMEX> start <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">55 miles</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">90 km</NUMEX>) east of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Palm Beach</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">arc 600 miles</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">970 km</NUMEX>) southeast toward eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Haiti</ENAMEX>, like a series of stepping stones linking <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North America</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX>.
Some of the islands are <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only a few hundred square meters</NUMEX> in size, but together they make up an area of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5,380 sq miles</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">14,000 sq km</NUMEX>), slightly smaller than the area of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hawaiian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Islands</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only 100</NUMEX> of the islands are inhabited; many of these have become private <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">playgrounds</ENAMEX> for the rich and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">super-rich</ENAMEX>. Even fewerÂ â<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">€”Â 37</NUMEX> to be exactÂ<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC"> â€”Â have settlements</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX>. This leaves <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">many hundreds</NUMEX> of cays that are totally natural, untouched by the destructive influence of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> and offering pristine habitats to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bird</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal species</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bahamas</ENAMEX> islands are the flattened peaks of a huge ancient mountain range that once towered many <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">thousands of feet</NUMEX> into the sky. They now lie low in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, the highest pointÂ<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL"> â€”Â Mount Alvernia on Cat</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">IslandÂ â€”Â</ENAMEX> being <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only 206 ft</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">65</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX>) above sea level. The eastern coastlines of the islands break the long tidal fetch that travels across the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX>; on the sheltered western coastline, coral outcrops have produced vast shallow sand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX> that reflect waters of myriad translucent blues and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">greens</ENAMEX>.
Indeed, it was these characteristic shallow <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX> that gave the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bahamas</ENAMEX> islands their name. When <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">explorers</ENAMEX> came to map the area in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16th century</TIMEX>, they named the area baja mar, or shallow seas, as a warning to the galleons that would be sailing through the waters. The name was later anglicized and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bahamas</ENAMEX> were born.
The warning on <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> maps unfortunately did little to stop <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX> from running aground or foundering on the treacherous shoals; even <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> treasure lost <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries ago</TIMEX> is still being discovered and salvaged.
The islands of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bahamas</ENAMEX> were claimed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX>, but <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of secret coves became home to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pirates</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">smugglers</ENAMEX> who turned their backs on nationality to enter the brotherhood of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">buccaneers</ENAMEX>. They ruled the seas, plundering <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX> at will, and then spent their ill-gotten gains in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX> and brothels of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Nassau town</ENAMEX>, the main settlement.
Later, as the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">English colonies of North America</ENAMEX> fought for independence, the islands became a refuge for fleeing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">loyalists</ENAMEX> who sought to make a new life on these remote, picturesque cays. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cotton</ENAMEX> production brought a number of slaves to the islands, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crops</ENAMEX> proved to be poor and depleted the already weak soil. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sponge</ENAMEX> gathering was devastated after a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fungus</ENAMEX> attacked the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crop</ENAMEX>, and sisal was produced more cheaply in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South America</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> eked out a living, but little more than that. Things changed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1920s</TIMEX>, however, when the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bahamas</ENAMEX> profited from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> policy of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Prohibition</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rum</ENAMEX>-running became a major industry, and well-to-do <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> began making the short trip to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bahamas</ENAMEX> to be able to drink legally, and to indulge in other pleasures.
Since <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bahamas</ENAMEX> has worked hard to extend the service it provided during <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Prohibition</ENAMEX> and has turned itself into a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œparadiseâ€</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">holiday</TIMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">makers</ENAMEX>. The dazzling beaches are covered with fine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sand</ENAMEX> that ranges from bright white to pastel pink. The sun shines year-round, with temperatures ranging from the high <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">60s</NUMEX> to the high <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">80s fahrenheit</NUMEX>. To these natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ingredients</ENAMEX> have been added just about every amenity and service needed for the perfect holiday. Everything centers on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Providence</ENAMEX>, where most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> stay and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Bahamian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> lives. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the largest cruise <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ports</ENAMEX> in the world, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Nassau</ENAMEX> can accommodate <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> large <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time. <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English â€œpomp</ENAMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€ stout forts</ENAMEX>, and colonial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> attract history <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buffs</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grand Bahama</ENAMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> most populous <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX>, has <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Freeportâ€“Lucaya</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nassauâ</ENAMEX>€™s younger, less genteel <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">â€œAmericanâ€ cousin</ENAMEX>; nightlife here is more lavish and audacious than in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Nassau</ENAMEX>. Both islands have large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort hotels</ENAMEX> that offer water-sports, floor shows, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">casinos</ENAMEX> where you can enjoy the thrill of winning or the dejection of losing. Golf <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX> entice you to lower your handicap. Tour buses plow a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">path</ENAMEX> around the attractions, and duty-free <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> tempt you to buy that little luxury item youâ€™ve been denying yourself for so long. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Hundreds</NUMEX> of day-trippers cruise to both islands, eager to do it all before they have to get back on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX>.
On the smaller and more remote islandsÂ<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART"> â€”Â called the Out Islands or Family IslandsÂ â€”Â intimate</ENAMEX> resorts cater to your every need and make it possible for you to forget about schedules, deadlines, and traffic jams. The most difficult decision youâ€™ll have to make is what to pick from the extensive dinner menu. While the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clubs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">casinos</ENAMEX> may not play on into <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the night</TIMEX>, during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> youâ€™ll be worn out by walks along the beach and other strenuous activities, such as collecting sea shells, enjoying long lunches, and applying sunblock. The whole trip could prove to be exhausting!
The lure of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bahamas</ENAMEX> is, of course, as much about the sea as it is about the land. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX> of the western <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX> are still some of the clearest and most beautiful in the world. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> the shallows are glassy still and range from azure blue to emerald green; the deep ocean channels reflect a deep blue that can best be appreciated from the air. The sandy shallows are ideal for swimming and snorkeling, and since the development of scuba (an acronym for self-contained underwater breathing apparatus) gear in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1930s</TIMEX>, the seas around the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bahamas</ENAMEX> have become a top destination for diving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enthusiasts</ENAMEX> from around the world. 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bahamas</ENAMEX> support a vast range of life and contain <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 percent</NUMEX> of the worldâ€™s coral. Diving around the reef surfaces and the vertical reef walls is complemented by many <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ship</ENAMEX> wrecks and artificial <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sitesÂ â€”Â large</ENAMEX>, concrete blocks which are placed on the sea bed to encourage coral growthÂ â€”Â surrounding the islands. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Fish species</ENAMEX> mass in the vast shallows along with urchins and starfish. Yet deep ocean channels cut between some island groupsÂ<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE"> â€”Â the Tongue</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ocean</ENAMEX> between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Andros</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Providence</ENAMEX>, for example, is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6,000 ft</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2,000 m</NUMEX>) deepÂ â€”Â and these provide a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">thoroughfare</ENAMEX> for a number of large <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> and marine <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mammal species</ENAMEX>, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sharks</ENAMEX>, rays, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dolphins</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">turtles</ENAMEX>.
This not only provides excitement for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">divers</ENAMEX>, who can watch <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">shark feeding</ENAMEX> in the wild on some <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Bahamian</ENAMEX> islands, but also to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fishermen</ENAMEX>. The vast numbers of large <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish species</ENAMEX>, including record breaking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">marlin</ENAMEX> and bonefish, make for some of the most challenging and thrilling sport-fishing in the world.
On top of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, the shallow <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> and sheltered seas provide ideal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX> for sailing and cruising. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Hundreds</NUMEX> of unmanned cays offer idyllic destinations and mooring points. The desert island you always dreamed about is somewhere in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BahamasÂ â€”Â the Exumas</ENAMEX> themselves have one cay for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day of year</TIMEX>, and that is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> part of the vast <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commonwealth</ENAMEX>. Many lie <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">only a few hours</TIMEX> sailing time from the hubbub of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Nassau</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Bahamian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are among the friendliest youâ€™ll ever meet, and they are eager to share the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">homeland</ENAMEX> they love with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> is a fascinating mixture of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">descendants</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Loyalist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">settlers</ENAMEX> who left <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Revolution</ENAMEX>, freedom <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lovers</ENAMEX> who escaped religious persecution, and ex-slaves set free following emancipation. This mixture, which could have produced a society fraught with problems, has evolved into a gentle, sociable, and happy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, proud of their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">homeland</ENAMEX> and the progress they have made since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">independence in 1973</TIMEX>. With a stable economy, good health, and no taxes, itâ€™s no wonder that a smile comes naturally to all <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bahamians</ENAMEX>. All the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> still have strong religious faith, the pretty <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX> are full on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sundays</TIMEX>, and a conversation about some future event always ends with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">â€œâ€¦God willingâ€</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â</NUMEX>€œâ€¦with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lordâ</ENAMEX>€™s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blessing</ENAMEX>.â€
To make the most of your trip youâ€™ll need to tune your mind to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â</NUMEX>€œBahamian time.â€ On <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Providence</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Grand Bahama</ENAMEX> this may not be much slower than at home, but on the Out <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Islands</ENAMEX>, time definitely runs more slowly, and nothing is so important that it canâ€™t wait a while. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> are more important than to-do lists, so a leisurely exchange of greetings and an inquiry about your familyâ€™s well-being precedes any business activity. This genuine thoughtfulness also extends to visitors; someone will always go out of their way to be helpful, in ways that have been lost in more developed locations.
Every <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> has its own individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX>, forged by a unique history and development, in fact the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bahamas</ENAMEX> could be said to be several different holiday experiences in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, so itâ€™s important to choose your island carefully to get the kind of holiday you want.
