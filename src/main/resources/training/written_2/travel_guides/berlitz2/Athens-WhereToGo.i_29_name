Where to Go
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V</ENAMEX> iewed from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">air¬†‚Äî¬†or</ENAMEX> from the high ground of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acropolis</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mount Lycabettus¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†Athens is a sprawling <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>; a maze of apartment <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">blocks</ENAMEX> and office <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> stretching as far as the eye can see. Yet the downtown area is remarkably compact. Most of the major <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> are within walking distance of one another, but the inexpensive and reliable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metro</ENAMEX> system links many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX> and attractions for those who get a little foot weary. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ancient</ENAMEX> remains are scattered across the central downtown <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">area</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> has grown almost organically throughout its history, resulting in numerous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">districts</ENAMEX>, each with its own particular character. This guide divides the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> into a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX>, covering the ancient center of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> first and then moving clockwise through the other important <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">districts</ENAMEX>. Attractions featured will include major squares, gardens, ruins, monuments, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX>.
The heart of ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> was centered around the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dome</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acropolis</ENAMEX>, with sacred temples built atop the rock and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> built on its undulating flanks. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> the area is still replete with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> remains, though these are interspersed with later buildings¬†‚Äî¬†a fascinating mixture of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Neo-Classical</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansions</ENAMEX> and terraced <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cottages</ENAMEX> dating back to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottoman</ENAMEX> times. This area, known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Plaka</ENAMEX>, is now perhaps the most charming in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> and acts as a magnet to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> from around the world.
The Acropolis
It is impossible to overestimate the importance of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acropolis</ENAMEX> to the ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greeks</ENAMEX>. The religious significance of this sheer-sided rock, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">90 m</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">300 ft</ENAMEX>) above the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, was paramount, and the enduring images of the temples there still represent the principles of freedom and democracy in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the present day</TIMEX>. You can see the temples from most parts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">city¬†‚Äî¬†particularly</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> when they are well-lit¬†‚Äî¬†which only adds to the feeling that this small area is still the essence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. The name <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Acropolis</ENAMEX> derives from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> words acro <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">meaning ‚Äúhighest point‚Äù</ENAMEX> and polis, meaning <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>.
Try to visit <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early or late in the day</TIMEX> to avoid the tour <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, or on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Mondays</TIMEX>, when most tours don‚Äôt operate; and remember to wear comfortable, flat shoes as there are many slippery stones worn smooth over the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX>, and numerous uneven areas where heels can catch.
Once through the ticket office a path leads to the summit of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Acropolis¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†a relatively flat plateau around <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">320 m by 130 m</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,049 ft by 426 ft</NUMEX>) in area. This path is the original ‚Äúsacred way,<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">‚Äù</ENAMEX> used for ceremonial entrances to the inner sanctum in ancient times.
Used for strategic purposes throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mycenaean</ENAMEX> and Archaic periods the rock was easy to defend; it had a water supply and superb views of the surrounding area. The first religious <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> appeared <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at the end of the sixth century</TIMEX> b.c., when the summit became a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">sanctuary</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> was founded on lower ground below. These early temples were destroyed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Persian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xerxes</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">480</NUMEX> b.c. Following this, new defensive walls were constructed that included elements of the ruined old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Athena</ENAMEX> and the old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parthenon</ENAMEX>.
It was during the era of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pericles</ENAMEX> that construction began on many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> that we see <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>. He commissioned the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parthenon, Erechthe√≠on</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Athena Nike</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Propylaia</ENAMEX>, taking advantage of a new marble quarry on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mount Pentelikon¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†the marble became known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentelic</ENAMEX>. As the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Romans</ENAMEX> took control of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> they embellished the site with small additions, but the wake of Christianity and the decline of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> power saw the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acropolis</ENAMEX> vulnerable to attack, theft, and vandalism. Statuary was removed and temples were used as <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palaces</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> nobles during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 14th century</TIMEX>. The rock reverted to its earliest use as a strategic stronghold during <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottoman</ENAMEX> rule, resulting in damage to most of the major <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX>. Vast amounts of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stone</ENAMEX> were taken from temples on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pinnacle</ENAMEX> for a program of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> below.
Following <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> independence, a zealous restoration project saw the removal of all medieval and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottoman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> on the plateau, and harkened the beginning of archaeological study of the ancient remains. This continues to the present day.
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX> impressions as you make your way towards the inner <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">sanctuary</ENAMEX> are of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Beul√© Gate</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> addition of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the third century</TIMEX> a.d. The path leads on directly in front of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Athena Nike</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Propylaia</ENAMEX> (sacred entranceway), which led on into the inner sanctum. This monumental gateway was a sign of things to come, and for the ordinary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> it was meant to inspire and impress. It retains this ability in modern times, even though the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> was never finished. Construction began in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">437 b.c.</TIMEX> to a plan by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mnisikles</ENAMEX>, an otherwise unknown <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX>. A series of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Doric</ENAMEX> columns mark the transition into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Propylaia</ENAMEX> following which there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> symmetrical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> on either side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">walkway</ENAMEX>. Ionic colonnades frame the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">walkway</ENAMEX> (this was the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> to incorporate both styles of column). There were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> heavy wooden doors along the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">walkway</ENAMEX>, heightening the tension of those ancient pilgrims, as each would be opened in turn. The only <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> to have been completed was the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> on the northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">side</ENAMEX>. This was used as a waiting <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> and also, according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">historian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pausanias</ENAMEX>, as a picture <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">gallery</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pinakotheke</ENAMEX>, the name it holds <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>.
Once through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Propylaia</ENAMEX>, the sacred way leads on to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acropolis</ENAMEX> plateau proper. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Classical</ENAMEX> times a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">9 m</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> ft) statue of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Athena Promachos</ENAMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defender</ENAMEX>) dedicated to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Athenian</ENAMEX> exploits during the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Persian</ENAMEX> Wars stood immediately beyond the entranceway. This was taken to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Constantinople</ENAMEX> during the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Byzantine</ENAMEX> era. Make your way left along the southern flank of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Propylaia</ENAMEX> to view the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Athena Nike</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Athena of Victory</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acropolis</ENAMEX> had been a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">sanctuary</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Athena Nike</ENAMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fifth century</TIMEX> b.c. and following the sacking of the site by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Persians</ENAMEX> a new smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX>, or na√Øskos, was commissioned and designed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Callicrates</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Six</NUMEX> elegant columns support a pediment with decorative friezes depicting the gods on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mount Olympus</ENAMEX> and heroic battle scenes of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">warriors</ENAMEX> fighting barbarians. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX>, built on the remains of an older <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Mycenaean wall</ENAMEX>, offers excellent views across the surrounding landscape, and this location was prized by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ottomans</ENAMEX>, who tore down the structure to build a defensive battery. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> has been painstakingly re-erected using rubble found underneath the battery when it was removed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1830s</TIMEX>.
Walking back to the center of the plateau you‚Äôll pass scant remains of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sanctuary</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Artemis Brauronia</ENAMEX> founded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fourth century</TIMEX> b.c., but your eyes will be drawn to the immense structure of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parthenon</ENAMEX>, which dominates today‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acropolis</ENAMEX> site.
The Parthenon
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parthenon</ENAMEX> is one of the most recognizable <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> in the world. The series of columns supporting pediment and frieze is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> to many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>, and would have been also to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">travelers</ENAMEX> in ancient times. However, they would have seen a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> with a veneer of splendid color and decorated with magnificently carved sculptures; not to mention a strong wooden roof now lost to posterity. What remains is the bare <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentelic</ENAMEX> marble used in the construction and the refined lines and form that make it an architectural masterpiece.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parthenon</ENAMEX> was dedicated to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Athena</ENAMEX> and means <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Virgin¬†‚Äî¬†Athena</ENAMEX> in her guise as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">protector</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">goddess</ENAMEX> of wisdom and justice. It also housed the national <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">treasury</ENAMEX>, bringing together the spiritual and secular power of ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">At least four</NUMEX> other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Parthenons</ENAMEX> have been built on the site¬†‚Äî¬†in fact, the base of the present temple indicates that its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">predecessor</ENAMEX> was wider. Designed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architects</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Callicrates</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Iktinus</ENAMEX>, work began in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">447 b.c.</TIMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> was dedicated in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">438 b.c.</TIMEX> with a huge celebration, the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Panathenaic Festival</ENAMEX>, that involved <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>; live <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> were sacrificed at an altar on the eastern fa√ßade. This festival then took place <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every four years</TIMEX> during the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Pagan</ENAMEX> era and continued until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fifth century</TIMEX> a.d. (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42</NUMEX>). Converted into a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the sixth century</TIMEX>, the cella (inner <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX>) had frescoes painted on its walls and upper <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">galleries</ENAMEX> where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> worshipped. A bell <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> was added by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Byzantines</ENAMEX> who named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">it Agia Sophia</ENAMEX>, also meaning wisdom. Later, under <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottoman</ENAMEX> rule, the bell <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> became a minaret and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> was converted into a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX>.
Eventually it was used as a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">powder</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 1687</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Venetian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> threatened <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> and one of their mortars hit the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parthenon</ENAMEX>, igniting the powder inside. The resulting explosion badly damaged the structure and many other ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> on the site. The center of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parthenon</ENAMEX> was totally destroyed along with many columns and priceless carved friezes. Subsequent ‚Äúlicences‚Äù granted by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ottomans</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nobles</ENAMEX> saw many prize friezes disappear to archaeological collections around <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, including the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Elgin</ENAMEX> marbles (ornately carved pediments) that were taken to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lord Elgin</ENAMEX>. Restoration of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> has been almost constant since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1834</TIMEX>.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> it is not possible to walk among the columns and through what remains of the inner <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX>. This echoes the rules of ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX>, when only the highest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priests</ENAMEX> could enter the cella. There they would be able to worship an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ivory</ENAMEX>-and- gold-covered wooden statue of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Athena</ENAMEX> said to be <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">12 m</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39</NUMEX> ft) high which has long since been lost. Walk around the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">70 m</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">228 ft</ENAMEX>) by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 m</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">101 ft</ENAMEX>) exterior to really appreciate the grace of the columns. There are no straight lines anywhere in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">building¬†‚Äî¬†the</ENAMEX> graduated curves simply create the illusion of the vertical and horizontal.
To the north of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parthenon</ENAMEX> stand the graceful statues of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Porch of the Caryatids</ENAMEX>, which adorn the southern fa√ßade of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Erechthe√≠on.</ENAMEX> This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> is an unusual m√©lange of architectural styles, with <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> at varying levels, where the worship of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gods</ENAMEX> took place. It was the last of the great building flurry of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pericles</ENAMEX> to be finished, dedicated in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">406</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">b.c. Built</ENAMEX> beside an ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Athena</ENAMEX> whose scant remains can just be seen, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Erechthe√≠on</ENAMEX> brought together the worship of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Athena</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Poseidon</ENAMEX> under <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">roof¬</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">†‚Äî¬†legend</ENAMEX> says that following the contest between the two gods for the honor of protecting <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX>, they were reconciled and this dual temple recognized their special bond with regard to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Erechtheus¬†‚Äî¬†part</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>, part snake¬†‚Äî¬†was a legendary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> who, over the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX>, became closely connected with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Poseidon</ENAMEX>. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zeus</ENAMEX> also forms part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> was damaged by fire almost immediately, and again during the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> period. It was converted into a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the sixth century</TIMEX> a.d. and was used as a harem <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> during <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottoman</ENAMEX> times.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">caryatids¬†‚Äî¬†female</ENAMEX> figures used as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pillars¬†‚Äî¬†are</ENAMEX> thought to represent the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arrephoroi</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">maidens</ENAMEX> who attended to the goddess <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Athena</ENAMEX> and performed rituals in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">sanctuary</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX>), as they all originally carried libation <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX> in their hands. Both the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX> and the arms of the caryatids have been destroyed. The sculptures at the site are copies, with all but one of the originals displayed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acropolis Museum</ENAMEX>. Their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">portico</ENAMEX> protected the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tomb</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cecrops</ENAMEX>, the mythical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX>.
Beyond the porch is the eastern fa√ßade. Here a row of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ionian</ENAMEX> columns mark the entrance to a rectangular inner sanctum of the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Athena</ENAMEX>. The walls of the interior were removed during the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Byzantine</ENAMEX> era, and the north corner (column and pediment) was removed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Elgin</ENAMEX> and taken to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> with the ‚ÄúElgin marbles.‚Äù
A large north porch balances that of the southern <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Porch of the Caryatids</ENAMEX>. This sits on high <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">foundations</ENAMEX> as the ground level falls steeply on the northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">side</ENAMEX>. Much of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> here dates from the time of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman Empire¬</ENAMEX>†‚Äî¬†a devastating fire destroyed the earlier temples to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zeus</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Poseidon</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marks</ENAMEX> on the ground in the porch area suggest that this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> was once struck by lightning. A hole was left in the ceiling of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> since the belief at the time was that a lightning strike should never be closed off from the sky. Ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greeks</ENAMEX> believed that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acropolis</ENAMEX> was guarded by a giant snake that lived under this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pilgrims</ENAMEX> would buy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">honey cakes</ENAMEX> for this snake and leave them at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> entrance for it to enjoy.
The west wall was restored in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 20th century</TIMEX> after it fell down in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1852</TIMEX>. The reconstruction recreates the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> era. 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acropolis Museum</ENAMEX> in the southeast corner of the plateau was opened in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1934</TIMEX>. It was designed and built so as not to spoil the skyline or compete with the temples and it cannot be seen from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> or from the sacred way as you enter through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Propylaia</ENAMEX>. Much of the fine statuary and carved friezes still present when <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottoman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> left have been displayed here along with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> of the original <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caryatid</ENAMEX> statues from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Erechthe√≠on.</ENAMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> displays pieces of the ornate decorative pediment that adorned the temples, and dedications to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Athena</ENAMEX> herself found in the inner <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">sanctuary</ENAMEX>. The whole collection is breathtaking and proof if it were needed of the immense wealth and influence of this ancient site. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> has something of note but look for the pediment of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">lion</ENAMEX> tearing apart a bull, dating from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the sixth century</TIMEX> b.c. in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1</TIMEX>. Pediment depicting a triple-headed demon, and a kouros (male statue) named The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Calf-bearer¬†‚Äî¬†a</ENAMEX> young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> carrying a calf to ritual slaughter at the temple¬†‚Äî¬†are both displayed in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Kritikos Boy and Blond-haired Boy¬†‚Äî¬†two</ENAMEX> sculptures carved in the ‚Äúsevere‚Äù style fashionable around <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">480</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">b.c.</ENAMEX> are displayed in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6</TIMEX>. Panels from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ionic</ENAMEX> frieze that decorated the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parthenon</ENAMEX> are in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8</TIMEX>, and the original <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caryatids</ENAMEX> can be found in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> 9.
When you have explored the architectural delights of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acropolis</ENAMEX>, take time to enjoy the views from its walls. Sections of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stone</ENAMEX> defences date back to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mycenaean</ENAMEX> times, though the majority were constructed during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first millennium</TIMEX> and were reinforced by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turks</ENAMEX>. From the north you can take in the other major archaeological <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> and the district of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plaka</ENAMEX> directly below. From the east the verdant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">slopes</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mount Lycabettus</ENAMEX> come into view, with the smart district of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kolonaki</ENAMEX> on its lower slopes. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South</ENAMEX> leads the eye towards the coast and the islands of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Saronic Gulf</ENAMEX>. 
As you leave the site via the smooth stone <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">path</ENAMEX> through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Propylaia</ENAMEX> you‚Äôll pass the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monument of Agrippa</ENAMEX>. Originally erected with a single chariot to commemorate victory in the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Panathenaic Games</ENAMEX>, a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> chariot <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> including <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marcus Agrippa</ENAMEX> was added in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">b.c. You‚Äôll</ENAMEX> leave through the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Beul√© Gate</ENAMEX>, a remaining part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> defensive system.
Around the Acropolis
A number of other archaeological remains can be found on the flanks of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acropolis</ENAMEX> and on nearby hills. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Head</ENAMEX> south of the rock by taking a left out of the main entrance and you‚Äôll reach the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> after a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five-minute</TIMEX> stroll.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Odeon of Herodes Atticus</ENAMEX> was one of the last great <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building projects</ENAMEX> of ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX>. The vast auditorium was completed towards <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the second century</TIMEX> a.d. in typical <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> style. During <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Byzantine</ENAMEX> times it was used as a dye works, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ottomans</ENAMEX> used it for defensive purposes. However, excavations began in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1850s</TIMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Odeon</ENAMEX> is once again holding <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">spectacular summer</TIMEX> performances. 
On the southeastern flank of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acropolis</ENAMEX> are the vast remains of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Theatre of Dionysus</ENAMEX>, hacked out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">earth</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fifth century</TIMEX> b.c. and upgraded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the third century</TIMEX> b.c. In <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> times a long colonnaded stoa and promenade linked the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">theaters</ENAMEX>, but only scant remains can be seen <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">theater</ENAMEX> (separate fee with entrance at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Od√≥s Thrasyllou</ENAMEX>) was the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">birthplace</ENAMEX> of the dramatic and comic art and formed the social and political heart of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> during its ‚Äúgolden age.‚Äù The premiers of several major pieces by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sophocles, Euripides</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aristophanes</ENAMEX> were performed here, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> assembly also met here late in its history. The whole auditorium held <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, but most interesting are the carved front row thrones for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VIPs</ENAMEX>, including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> with lion‚Äôs-claw feet that was reserved for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priest</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dionysus Eleutherios</ENAMEX>. The particularly fine bema of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phaedros</ENAMEX> (carved stage) depicting scenes from the life <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Dionysus¬†‚Äî¬†god</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">merriment¬†‚Äî¬†is</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> origin. Surrounding the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">theater</ENAMEX> are remains of several other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> including an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asclepieion</ENAMEX> (place of healing) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Odeon of Pericles</ENAMEX>. These are currently being worked on by archaeologists. 
To the west of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acropolis</ENAMEX> stands another small range of hills now cut by footpaths and covered in <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> offering cooling shade in the heat of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX>. This area, reached by crossing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Od√≥s Rovertou Gali</ENAMEX> and walking up behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dionysus</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX>, offers splendid views across to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acropolis</ENAMEX> (it‚Äôs the best place for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> overviews), and the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Sound and Light Show</ENAMEX> auditorium is located here for this reason. Several archaeological <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> can be seen and the area is much less crowded than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acropolis</ENAMEX> itself. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">You‚Äôll</ENAMEX> also see <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16th century</TIMEX> church, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ayios Dim√≠trios Loumbardhi</ENAMEX>, nestling under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">woodland canopy</ENAMEX>.
In the northeastern area, you‚Äôll come to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hill</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pnyx</ENAMEX>, meeting place of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Assembly</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX>. Loosely translated, pnyx means ‚Äúcrowded or tightly packed place,‚Äù and in ancient times this was a highly populated area. You‚Äôll see the outlines of walls, including the defensive <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Themistoklean Wall</ENAMEX>, between the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">bushes</ENAMEX> or under the turf as you stroll. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pnyx</ENAMEX> meeting place can be found below the summit on the northeastern side of the hill. When <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">democracy</ENAMEX> was established <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at the end of the sixth century</TIMEX> b.c. the debating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX> moved from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agora</ENAMEX> to this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> and it was here that the great <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">statesmen</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX> made their speeches at the rostrum. Seats were provided for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> needed for a decision-making quorum, who would listen to the arguments of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pericles</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Themistocles</ENAMEX>. 
On the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hill</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nymphs</ENAMEX> north of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pnyx</ENAMEX> you‚Äôll see the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Neo-Classical</ENAMEX> lines of the original <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens Observatory</ENAMEX>, founded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1842</TIMEX>. Perhaps the most popular point for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> lies in the south where at the highest point¬<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">†‚Äî¬†Hill of the Muses or Philopappos Hill¬†‚Äî¬†is the Tomb of Philopappos</ENAMEX>, a high-ranking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nobleman</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> times. Its convex fa√ßade has a sculptured frieze depicting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Julius Philopappos</ENAMEX> riding a chariot and performing his duties in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX>. It is from here that you‚Äôll get the best views of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acropolis</ENAMEX>, so don‚Äôt forget your camera or video recorder!
On the north flank of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acropolis</ENAMEX> is the hill of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Areopagos</ENAMEX>, found close to the right of the main <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acropolis</ENAMEX> ticket <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>. With views across the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> below it is a popular spot for photographs, however it also has a long and illustrious history. Tradition states that this was the site of the original <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Agora</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX>, and the original <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">council</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> was known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Council of Areopagos</ENAMEX>. Later it held <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX> of law, and justice was dispensed here. In a.d. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">51</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Paul</ENAMEX> addressed a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Athenians</ENAMEX> from the hill with his sermons of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> faith. He met with a hostile response from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pagan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, but did convert <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dionysus</ENAMEX> who later became the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patron saint</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plaka</ENAMEX> and Anafiotika
After all the exploration of these fascinating archaeological sites, you‚Äôll probably be ready for a rest and change of scenery. As you make your way to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> you‚Äôll pass through <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">districts</ENAMEX> which offer a range of caf√©s, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX>, and tavernas, along with images of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> daily life not found in more modern parts of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX>. 
The tiny <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">area</ENAMEX> called Anafiotika hugs the high ground immediately below the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acropolis</ENAMEX>. Built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th century</TIMEX> for migrant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> from around <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX> that came to take advantage of construction opportunities in the capital, the first few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> came from the island of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anafi</ENAMEX> and wanted to create surroundings that would remind them of home. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> the narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> with their neat, whitewashed, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cottages</ENAMEX> and plethora of potted <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">geraniums</ENAMEX> are still reminiscent of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Aegean</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">settlements</ENAMEX> across the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plaka</ENAMEX> lies below <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anafiotika</ENAMEX> and fills the space between the ancient and modern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, stretching to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Od√≥s Ermou</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Syntagma Square</ENAMEX> to the north. This was the center of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Byzantine</ENAMEX> times through to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> independence, and thus can be called <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Athens Old Town</ENAMEX>. The maze of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">narrow¬†‚Äî¬†mostly traffic-free¬†‚Äî¬†streets</ENAMEX> is a delight to explore and there are numerous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> and eateries to choose from. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Playful cats</ENAMEX> dart down the narrow alleyways, and you may be lucky to hear the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Terpsichordean</ENAMEX> notes of the laterna drifting through the streets¬†‚Äî¬†these hand-turned barrel organs are now becoming extremely rare. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plaka</ENAMEX> is particularly atmospheric in the evenings when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locals</ENAMEX> enjoy a volta, or stroll, before dinner and tavernas set tables out on the narrow side <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>. It is almost a living <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Byzantine Churches</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Neo-Classical</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansions</ENAMEX> housing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">galleries</ENAMEX> or collectibles <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX>, and a wealth of historical detail at every turn. Do look beyond the tempting shop fronts to really get the most out of your tour. Though you‚Äôll want to simply follow your nose around the district, here are the locations of the main historical attractions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plaka</ENAMEX>.
At <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Kidathin√©on 17 you‚</NUMEX>Äôll find the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum of Greek Folk Art</ENAMEX>, which offers an interesting collection of embroidery, lace, and numerous liturgical garments. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spinning</ENAMEX> and weaving is also highlighted along with traditional puppets and festival masks and costumes. The collection features artifacts from all over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX> and her islands. Other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">divisions</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folk</ENAMEX> art <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> can be found around the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. 
On the southern end of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Od√≥s Adrianou</ENAMEX>, in a small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> surrounded by caf√©s, is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monument of Lysicrates</ENAMEX>. Dating from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fourth century</TIMEX> b.c., it consists of a series of curved <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panels</ENAMEX> and columns creating a circular structure supporting a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dome</ENAMEX> made from a single block of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentelic</ENAMEX> marble. Originally, this would have been topped by a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bronze tripod‚ÄÇ¬†‚Äî¬†a</ENAMEX> prize awarded in choral competitions during the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Classical</ENAMEX> era. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 18th century</TIMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Capuchin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monastery</ENAMEX> occupied land all around the monument and the interior of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base</ENAMEX> was used as a guest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lord Byron</ENAMEX> stayed here in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1810</TIMEX> and is said to have written some of his work while enjoying the seclusion.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansion</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Od√≥s Pan√≥s</ENAMEX>, high up near the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acropolis</ENAMEX>, has been turned into a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kanell√≥poulos Museum</ENAMEX>, which opened in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1976</TIMEX>, has a family collection of artifacts from many eras of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Athens‚</ENAMEX>Äô history. Mycenaean figurines and pottery, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Classical Greek</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> sculpture, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Byzantine</ENAMEX> icons, frescoes and tapestries are all well-displayed and illustrate very effectively the varied influences that make up the history of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>.
To the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> Agoras
From <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Plaka</ENAMEX> there are numerous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> leading northwest towards the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Agoras</ENAMEX>, however the most direct route is via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Od√≥s Adrianou</ENAMEX>. Take a short diversion right along <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Od√≥s Paleologolou</ENAMEX> to explore <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mitr√≥polis</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cathedral of the City</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX>. Built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1840s</TIMEX> following <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> independence from the remains of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 70</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX>, it is now surrounded by a network of supporting scaffolding erected following damage sustained in the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">1999 earthquake</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">cathedral</ENAMEX> is a focus for prayer, particularly to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Black Madonna</ENAMEX> surrounded by an ornate silver frame. In the shadow of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">cathedral</ENAMEX> is the tiny <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mikr√≠ Mitr√≥polis</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Little Cathedral</ENAMEX>), officially named <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Panay√≠a Gorgoep√≠kos</ENAMEX> and sometimes known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ayios Elefth√</ENAMEX>©rios or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúfreedom <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>,‚Äù the name given after <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Otto</ENAMEX> left the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> throne. Dating from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 12th century</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> was built using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stone</ENAMEX> from the ancient sites of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. Wander around its exterior walls to see sections from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> columns, or fragments of ornate pediments.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nearby¬†‚Äî¬†where Mitropoleos</ENAMEX> meets <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pentelis¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†is another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ay√≠a Dinamis</ENAMEX>, which means ‚Äúthe holy <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">power</ENAMEX> of the Virgin.‚Äù This tiny <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">place</ENAMEX> of worship has survived the redevelopment of the district but now sits literally underneath a modern office <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">block</ENAMEX>.
When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adrianou</ENAMEX> meets <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Od√≥s Eolou</ENAMEX>, it is cut by excavations on the site of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hadrian‚Äôs Library</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adrianou</ENAMEX> once passed directly through the site and still continues on the other side). The site is closed to the public but can easily be viewed from the surrounding <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>. Built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a.d. 123</TIMEX>, only the western wall is in good order. Turn left along <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Eolou</ENAMEX> to find the site of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman Agora</ENAMEX>. Founded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first century</TIMEX> a.d. to accommodate an expanding <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX>, the ornate entrance gate was commissioned by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Julius Caesar</ENAMEX> in honor of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Athena Archegetis</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Founder of the City</ENAMEX>). Much of the north and west wall of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Agora</ENAMEX> lies unexcavated under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plaka</ENAMEX>, but the south wall and the remains of the south colonnade are there, along with a series of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> near the ticket <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>. The most remarkable <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Agora</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> (though it was outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agora</ENAMEX> when built) is the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Tower of the Winds</ENAMEX>. This ornate octagonal-shaped <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> was a clock and meteorological <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX> built by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">astronomer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andronikos</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first century</TIMEX> b.c. Each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> faces corresponds to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cardinal</ENAMEX> point on the compass and is decorated with an ornate frieze depicting the wind blowing from that direction. The timing device was water-driven with a supply from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acropolis</ENAMEX> above.
Just beside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agora</ENAMEX> you‚Äôll see one of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mosques</ENAMEX> still standing in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">city¬†‚Äî¬†it</ENAMEX> now <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> an archaeological workshop and is not open to the public. Nearby on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Od√≥s Diogenous</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek Folk</ENAMEX> Music with a fascinating collection of instruments and musical recordings bringing the varied regional folk music of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX> to life.
Continue along <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Adrianou</ENAMEX> to find the remains of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Ancient Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Agora¬</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">†‚Äî¬†birthplace</ENAMEX> of western <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">democracy</ENAMEX> and the social heart of the ancient city-state of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> (agora comes from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> agiero, meaning to assemble). <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">From the sixth century</TIMEX> b.c., this area played host to a number of activities including religious and political meetings, law <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX>, education, shopping, or simply passing the time of day. Here <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Socrates</ENAMEX> regaled the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with his philosophical <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">theories¬†‚Äî¬†unfortunately</ENAMEX> for him he fell foul of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> and was put to death in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">403</NUMEX> b.c. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. Paul</ENAMEX> met an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúskeptics‚Äù</ENAMEX> who argued against him when he gave a speech here in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a.d. 51</TIMEX>. The whole area was razed during <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Barbarian</ENAMEX> attacks in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX> following the fall of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roman Empire</ENAMEX> and was covered with new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> during <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Byzantine</ENAMEX> times, all of which had to be cleared when excavations began.
From the entrance at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adrianou</ENAMEX> (there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> other entrances to the site) look immediately to your right to see remains of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Altar of the Twelve Gods</ENAMEX>; a small monument from where distances from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> to all other points in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> world were measured. This was truly the center of the world during the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Classical Greek</ENAMEX> era. Directly ahead in the area of the central <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Agora the outline of the Altar of Ares</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple of Ares</ENAMEX> can be seen in gravel. Behind this, the remains of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Odeon of Agrippa</ENAMEX>, built in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15 b.c.</TIMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Palace</ENAMEX> overlaid by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two later</TIMEX> stoas can be discerned. In the southeast corner of the site, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 11th century</TIMEX> church of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ayios Apostoloi</ENAMEX> is the only building on the site remaining from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Byzantine</ENAMEX> era. Greatly changed over the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX> it was fully restored to its original form in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 1950s</TIMEX>. The paintings in the narthex are original; others were transplanted from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hephaisteion</ENAMEX> (see below) when it was deconsecrated.
To the right, facing the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bouleuterions</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">council</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chambers</ENAMEX>). These served the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> from the time of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kleisthenes</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Council</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late fifth century</TIMEX> b.c. Beyond the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">council</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chambers stands</ENAMEX> the best-preserved <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Athens¬†‚Äî¬†the Hephaisteion</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple of Hephaistos</ENAMEX>, also known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thisio</ENAMEX>. The design of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> is classic <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Doric</ENAMEX> and was completed after the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Persian</ENAMEX> invasions. Hephaistos was the god of metalworking, and this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> was set at the heart of the smithing and ironmongery district of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. Later it was converted into a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> with the addition of interior walls and this survived through <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottoman</ENAMEX> times¬†‚Äî¬†the last services were performed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1830s</TIMEX>. For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">some years</TIMEX> following it served as the first archaeological <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX>. 
The exterior of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> is well-preserved and uses the same curved lines as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parthenon</ENAMEX>, though the columns are more slender and the entablature (horizontal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platform</ENAMEX> above the columns) sturdier. The metopes (carved space on a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Doric frieze</NUMEX>) around the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">entablature</ENAMEX> depict the legendary feats of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heracles</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Theseus</ENAMEX>. Surrounding the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> is a garden area attempting to recreate a garden that existed here in the ancient era. It includes the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants species¬†‚Äî¬†medicinal</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">herbal¬†‚Äî¬†that</ENAMEX> were popular during that time. 
The eastern flank of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agora</ENAMEX> site is dominated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stoa of Attalos</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX> erected by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Attalos</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pergamon</ENAMEX> and opened in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">138 b.c.</TIMEX>, it was faithfully recreated during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1950s</TIMEX> to offer us a stunning vision of what communal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> were like in ancient times. Stoas were extremely popular in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> era and all large <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">settlements</ENAMEX> had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>. These <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">long</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">porches</ENAMEX> or porticos provided shade in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> and shelter in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> and they were often used to link important community <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stoa of Attalos</ENAMEX> was a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-story construction with <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> at the back that housed small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> it is home to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agora Museum</ENAMEX> and displays numerous artifacts found at this extensive sight. Here you‚Äôll find a range of everyday objects not seen in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acropolis Museum</ENAMEX>, in addition to religious and civic statuary and mosaics.
The route of the great ‚Äúsacred way‚Äù that linked the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agora</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Acropolis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">above¬†‚Äî¬†and</ENAMEX> that was used during the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Panathenaic Festival¬†‚Äî¬†is</ENAMEX> now being excavated and rebuilt to allow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> to walk in the footsteps of the ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Athenians</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monastir√°ki</ENAMEX> and Thissio
The area immediately to the north of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Agora¬</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">†‚Äî¬†‚ÄÇMonastir√°ki¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†is one of the most interesting in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX>. Under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ottomans</ENAMEX> it held the main market and despite the great amount of archaeological excavation that has taken place since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1820s</TIMEX>, it still retains the atmosphere of an oriental bazaar. Its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> are full of small trinket <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, coffee <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bars</ENAMEX>. In a throwback to ancient times there is still a metalworking and blacksmith area that produces handmade items, and you can find textiles, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ceramics</ENAMEX>, and copies of the latest ‚Äústreetwear.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äù Monastir√</ENAMEX>°ki is particularly cosmopolitan on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sundays</TIMEX> when a huge flea market fills the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> and you can haggle over furniture and knick-knacks for that unique <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">remembrance</ENAMEX> of your trip.
The district <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Monastir√°ki Square</ENAMEX> (with its busy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metro</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">station</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> at its heart¬<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">†‚Äî¬†the Pant√°nassa¬†‚Äî¬†‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇis thought to be part of a large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monastery</ENAMEX> complex that sat here before the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottoman</ENAMEX> invasion. As if to reiterate this historical event, the south side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> is dominated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mosque of Tsistar√°kis</ENAMEX>, built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1759</TIMEX> and named after the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottoman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX> of the time. It now houses the ceramics <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum of Greek Folk Art</ENAMEX>. 
The main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">thoroughfare</ENAMEX> cutting through the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">district</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Od√≥s Ermou</ENAMEX>, which leads east to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Syntagma Square</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ermou</ENAMEX> is one of the main shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, and numerous <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">retailers</ENAMEX> have <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outlets</ENAMEX> here. A small square cuts its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">path</ENAMEX> just a little way from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Monastir√°ki Square</ENAMEX>, and it is decorated with the beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Byzantine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kapnikar√©a</ENAMEX>, the official <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University</ENAMEX>. Built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 11th century</TIMEX> its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dome</ENAMEX> is supported by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> columns and its modern frescoes were created in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1950s</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fotis Kondoglou</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kapnikar√©a</ENAMEX> was earmarked for demolition in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1830s</TIMEX> but was saved by the personal intervention of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prince</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ludwig</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bavaria</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Greece‚Äôs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">first king</ENAMEX>.
We‚Äôll take the route west from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Monastir√°ki Square</ENAMEX>, as if leaving the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. This leads us <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">one kilometer</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">.62 miles</NUMEX>) to the archaeological site of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kerameik√≥s</ENAMEX>. As you walk along, immediately to the north of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ermou</ENAMEX> (on your right) is the district of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Psir√≠.</ENAMEX> Unspoiled by tourism, there is a very <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> atmosphere in the maze of narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> and some excellent tavernas among its traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>.
The excavated area of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kerameik√≥s</ENAMEX> is interesting because it incorporates a section of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">478</NUMEX> b.c. city <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wall</ENAMEX> and the ceremonial entranceways into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eleusis</ENAMEX> to the west and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Piraeus</ENAMEX> to the south. The <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Panathenian Festival Procession</ENAMEX> would start from here on its journey to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acropolis</ENAMEX>, and the procession of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Eleusian Mysteries</ENAMEX> would leave from here through the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Sacred Gate</ENAMEX> and along the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Sacred</ENAMEX> Way. The most important building found here is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pompeion</ENAMEX>, where procession paraphernalia was stored and where those involved in major processions would ready themselves. 
Kerameik√≥s was named for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">potters</ENAMEX> who worked here within the city walls (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inner Kerameik√≥s</ENAMEX>), directly on the site of good <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">clay deposits</ENAMEX>. Their work was carried around the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX> and is now displayed in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX> worldwide, but they were not highly regarded by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> in ancient times. Outside the wall (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Outer Kerameik√≥s</ENAMEX>), was the major <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cemetery</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> (it was forbidden to bury the dead within the city walls), with burials dating from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 12th century</TIMEX> b.c. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Major</ENAMEX> figures from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> history, including <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pericles</ENAMEX>, were buried here and their funerary artifacts are some of the most exquisite items found during excavations around the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. A small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> has burial finds dating from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12th‚Äìsixth centuries</TIMEX> b.c. but you‚Äôll see many more in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Archaeological Museum</ENAMEX>.
For those whose taste leans towards post-industrial landscapes, just a little way beyond <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Kerameik√≥s¬†‚Äî¬†across Od√≥s Pireos¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†is the old gas works of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gazi</ENAMEX>, which has been converted into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum of Industrial Architecture</ENAMEX>. It also hosts a regular program of art and photography exhibitions.
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Omonia Square</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plate√åa Om√≥nias</ENAMEX>)
From <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Monastir√°ki Station</ENAMEX> take the straight <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">thoroughfare</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Athinas</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Omonia Square</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Omonia</ENAMEX> means <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Concord</ENAMEX>), the commercial heart of the modern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. As you walk you‚Äôll pass through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Municipal Market</ENAMEX> area of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> where the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> buzz with constant activity; <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">goods</ENAMEX> spill out onto walls and alleyways; and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> throng the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sidewalks</ENAMEX>. The market operates from <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early morning</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">You‚Äôll</ENAMEX> also pass <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Plate√≠a Dimark√≠ou</ENAMEX>, also known as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Plate√≠a Kotzi√°</ENAMEX> where you‚Äôll find several fine <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Neo-Classical</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> including the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Mel√° Mansion</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1884</TIMEX>), now a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bank</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX> building. The center of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> has benefited from archaeological exploration during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1980s</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Athens Town Hall</ENAMEX> is on the left flank as you almost reach <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Omonia Square</ENAMEX>.
The rather shabby modern <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> belie <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Omonia‚</ENAMEX>Äôs importance. It‚Äôs always busy with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>; there are some good caf√©s and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, and some of the most prestigious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> have <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> here. Combine this with the bus and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metro</ENAMEX> routes that run through it, and you have a major <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city hub</ENAMEX>. 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Archaeological Museum</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">A ten-minute</TIMEX> walk north of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Od√≥s Patission</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Archaeological Museum</ENAMEX>, one of the most prestigious archaeological collections in the world. Finds cover <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7,000 years</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> history, and have been brought from sites all across <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX>. The collection brings the ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> world to life shedding light on almost every aspect of the daily activities of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX>. Prepare to spend <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">at least two hours</TIMEX> here, don‚Äôt try and rush this amazing collection. The map of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> issued with your ticket will be a great help in finding your way around the somewhat confusing array of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">corridors</ENAMEX>. You are sure to find your own <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">favorites</ENAMEX>, but here are a few acknowledged highlights. 
In the prehistoric collection (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3‚Äì6</TIMEX>) enjoy the treasure-trove found at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mycenae</ENAMEX>, including the exquisite, gold <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Mask of Agamemnon</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schiemann</ENAMEX> thought that this was placed over the face of the dead <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Agamemnon</ENAMEX> around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1200</TIMEX> b.c., but in fact it dates from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">over 300 years earlier</TIMEX>; the prehistoric <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> also have a collection of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cycladic</ENAMEX> figures dating from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the third millennium</TIMEX> b.c. The simple, rounded female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">figures</ENAMEX> were funerary or religious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX> and are in total contrast to the intricate pediment and frieze carvings and religious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">statuary</ENAMEX> found at temples on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acropolis</ENAMEX> and in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acropolis Museum</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">You‚Äôll</ENAMEX> also see a rare male figure among the collection, and the beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Harp Player¬†‚Äî¬†a</ENAMEX> more complex carving in the same style.
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Rooms 7‚Äì35</ENAMEX> concentrate on sculpture¬†‚Äî¬†perhaps the greatest collection of ancient sculpture in the world¬†‚Äî¬†and these are displayed to show the chronological development of the art form. Simply styled male and female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">figures</ENAMEX> (kouros and kore) of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Achaiac Age</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">seventh‚Äìfifth century b.c.</ENAMEX>) give way to more ornate and literal human forms as you walk through the collection into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Classical Age</ENAMEX> and then on to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hellenistic</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> eras. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Greek gods</ENAMEX> are popular themes, followed by eminent human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">figures</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> times. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Room 7</ENAMEX> holds the important early statue of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Artemis</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nikandre of Naxos</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">c640 b.c.</ENAMEX>).
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Room 15</ENAMEX> is dominated by a fine statue of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Poseidon</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bronze</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">460 b.c.</ENAMEX>) found in the sea off the island of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Euboea</ENAMEX>. The god is set to launch his trident against <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foes</ENAMEX> unknown. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hall of the Stairs</ENAMEX> hosts another statue dredged from the sea, that of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Jockey of the Artemision</ENAMEX>. The diminutive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">jockey</ENAMEX> drives on the handsome steed which has its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> front legs raised into the air, as if about to leap over an invisible obstacle.
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Rooms 36‚Äì39</ENAMEX> have a collection of bronzes including votive offerings found at the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Idaean Cave in Crete¬†‚Äî¬†mythical birthplace of the god Zeus</ENAMEX>. Rooms <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40 and 41</TIMEX> display artifacts from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> covering every era of history in the land of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pharaohs</ENAMEX>, including the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Ptolemaic</ENAMEX> period when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ptolemy</ENAMEX> (a general under <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander the Great</ENAMEX>, and therefore of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> descent) took control of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">descendants</ENAMEX> was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cleopatra</ENAMEX>, perhaps this most famous ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">queen</ENAMEX>. 
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor room</ENAMEX> 48 is devoted to finds from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Akrotiri</ENAMEX>, a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16th century</TIMEX> b.c. settlement on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santorini</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aegean</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">frescoes</ENAMEX> found while excavating the site are particularly fine and offer a glimpse into a world lost through a devastating earthquake around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1500</TIMEX> b.c. The remaining <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> floor¬<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">†‚Äî¬†49‚Äì56¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†feature an amazing collection of pottery and miniature objects, in contrast to the epically proportioned artifacts on the ground floor.
When you have finished your tour, head <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">block</ENAMEX> north to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pedion Areos</ENAMEX>, a large <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> area created in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1930s</TIMEX>, where you can enjoy the fresh air before continuing your explorations.
From <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Omonia</ENAMEX> to Syntagma
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> major thoroughfares run parallel between <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Omonia Square</ENAMEX> and nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Syntagma Square</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stadhiou</ENAMEX> is perhaps <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the busiest</TIMEX>, with several major department <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> and high-class <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> that sell jewelry and the best <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designer</ENAMEX> names, plus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> modern <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stoas</ENAMEX> packed with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bookstores</ENAMEX>. When you reach the small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Klathmonos</ENAMEX> you‚Äôll find the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum of the City</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> housed in the former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Otto‚Äôs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th century</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nearer to Syntagma</ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Koloktroni Square</ENAMEX>, is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Historical Museum</ENAMEX> with a collection of artifacts dating from post-Classical times. This is a useful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> to visit if you have a particular interest in post-independence <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX>, as many artifacts add detail to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> and incidents that shaped the new <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northeast of Stadhiou</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Panepistimiou</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University Street</ENAMEX>), officially named <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Elefther√≠a Veniz√©lou</ENAMEX> after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cretan statesman</ENAMEX>. This also plays host to several important <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Library</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Academy</ENAMEX> all sit here, confirming it as the academic and intellectual heart of modern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">All three</NUMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Neo-Classical</ENAMEX> in design and made of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentelic</ENAMEX> marble, helping to give a feel of how the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agora</ENAMEX> of the ancient city may have looked at its prime. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Academy</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1859</TIMEX>) is perhaps the most impressive of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> and was designed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Theophilus Hansen¬</ENAMEX>†‚Äî¬†pre-eminent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX> of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX>. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">native</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Denmark</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hansen</ENAMEX> was responsible for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zappion</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Observatory</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX>, and numerous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vienna</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Austria</ENAMEX>. The seated figures of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plato</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Socrates</ENAMEX> sit guarding the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Academy</ENAMEX> entrance and an intricately carved pediment depicts the gods and goddesses of the ancient world; these were sculpted by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leon√≠das Dr√≥sis</ENAMEX>. Come and look at these carvings through binoculars to get a feel of how richly decorated the temples and communal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> of the ancient world originally were. Walking towards <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Syntagma</ENAMEX> you‚Äôll pass the Renaissance-style <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heinrich Schliemann</ENAMEX>, that most famous of archaeologists, who was instrumental in turning the myth of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mycenaeans</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Trojan War</ENAMEX> into fact.
The outward-most <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">thoroughfare</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Akadimias</ENAMEX>, which runs behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Library</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Academy</ENAMEX>. Opposite these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> you‚Äôll find the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Athens Cultural Center</ENAMEX> housed in a former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> dating from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1830s</TIMEX>. There are auditoria and cultural exhibitions here, and a small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Theater Museum</ENAMEX> has displays charting the development of this art since ancient times.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syntagma</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Square¬†‚Äî¬†officially Plateia Syntagmatos</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Constitution Square¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†is perhaps the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">‚Äúemotional‚Äù home</ENAMEX> of modern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX>. It is dominated by the imposing fa√ßade of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parliament</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vouli</ENAMEX>, which was built as the new royal palace following independence, officially opened in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1836</TIMEX>. The use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentelic</ENAMEX> marble on the fa√ßade with a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Doric</ENAMEX>-style prolylaia above street level echoes use and form in the ancient city. In front of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Memorial of the Unknown Soldier</ENAMEX> commemorates all <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greeks</ENAMEX> who have fallen in war. Decorated with a modern carved relief of a <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Classical</ENAMEX> theme, the marble is inscribed with the words of an oration by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pericles</ENAMEX> to honor the dead of the wars of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Peloponnese¬†‚Äî¬†it</ENAMEX> is said that the tombs of these ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX> lie under this very spot. The tomb is guarded day and night by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">√âvzones¬†‚Äî¬†traditionally</ENAMEX> dressed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX> who became <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Guards</ENAMEX>, and then presidential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guards</ENAMEX> following the war of independence. The formal ‚Äúchanging of the guard‚Äù takes place <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every Sunday</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10:45am</TIMEX>, however the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the √âvzones have a duty switch <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">every hour</TIMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> when <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guards</ENAMEX> take the place of the old. This is one activity that you shouldn‚Äôt miss on your trip to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grande Bretagne Hotel</ENAMEX> on a nearby corner of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> was built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1842</TIMEX> and has become an <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX> during its lifetime. During WWII it became military <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX> of both the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Germans</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Winston Churchill</ENAMEX> survived a bomb attack here during his stay in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 1944</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Surrounding Syntagma</ENAMEX>
Numerous major thoroughfares converge on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syntagma</ENAMEX>, so it‚Äôs always busy with traffic. The new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metro</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">station</ENAMEX> also brings a steady stream of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. Still there is shade and a flower garden in the middle of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locals</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> alike rendezvous for lunch or dinner dates.
Behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parliament</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> are the verdant landscaped grounds of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">National Gardens</ENAMEX>. These were formerly for exclusive use of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Palace</ENAMEX> but now form an oasis within the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> with formal gardens, water features, and a children‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">playground</ENAMEX>. In the south of the garden you will find the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zappion Hall</ENAMEX>, an imposing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Neo-Classical</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> designed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hansen</ENAMEX> as a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">National Exhibition Center</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1888</TIMEX>. It now houses a modern conference <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>.
A <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five-minute</TIMEX> stroll from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syntagma</ENAMEX> down <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Avenue Amalias</ENAMEX> (or through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Gardens</ENAMEX>) brings you to another ancient site. At the confluence of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Avenues Amalias</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Syngrou</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vas</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Olgas</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hadrian‚Äôs Gate</ENAMEX> built as a triumphal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arch</ENAMEX> in a.d. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">131</NUMEX> to mark the divide between the ancient city and his ‚Äúnew <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX>.‚Äù To the east of the gate is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Olympieion</ENAMEX>, site of the largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> ever built on <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> soil.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple of Olympian Zeus</ENAMEX> is dedicated to <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Zeus, ‚Äúking‚Äù of the Greek gods</ENAMEX>. It was imperative that his temple should be fitting for his position, and its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">dimensions¬†‚Äî¬†250 m</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">814 ft</ENAMEX>) long and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">130 m</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">426 ft</ENAMEX>) wide, with columns of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 17</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">61</NUMEX> ft) in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">height¬†‚Äî¬†are truly majestic</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> took <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">700 years</TIMEX> to complete and it was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hadrian</ENAMEX> who finished the task in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the second century</TIMEX> a.d. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One hundred and eight</NUMEX> columns originally surrounded an inner sanctum that protected a gold-and-ivory statue of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zeus</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 15</NUMEX> are still standing, but their <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Corinthian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capitals</ENAMEX> have a wonderful form and elegance. In ancient times, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> sat close to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX> of the River Ilissos creating an even more beautiful vista. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> the river still flows, but its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">path</ENAMEX> lies beneath the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>.
Nearby, along <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Vas</ENAMEX>. Olgas, is the impressive <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Olympic Stadium</ENAMEX>, sitting in the lea of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ardittou Hill</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stadium</ENAMEX> was constructed for the ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Panathanaic Games</ENAMEX> when each of the surrounding city-states sent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">delegations</ENAMEX> to compete. During <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> times <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">beast</ENAMEX>-baiting also took place here. Dating from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the third century</TIMEX> b.c., the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> was refurbished for the games of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">a.d. 144</ENAMEX> but was disused and left to decay after the fall of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX>. When the modern <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Olympic Games</ENAMEX> were convened in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1896</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stadium</ENAMEX> was refurbished as the flagship arena, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> it stands as a symbol of the global athletic movement. Witness the heroic statues that stand in the entranceway. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> will once again host the games in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX>, but the central athletic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> will be at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kifissia¬†‚Äî¬†a northern</ENAMEX> suburb linked to the downtown <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">area</ENAMEX> by bus and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metro</ENAMEX>.
Leading directly east from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Syntagma Square</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avenue Vas</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sofias</ENAMEX>. This main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">thoroughfare</ENAMEX>, with a number of major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">embassies</ENAMEX>, leads to several important <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX> all within strolling distance or close to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Evangelismos Metro</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">station</ENAMEX>. Closest to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syntagma</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ben√°ki Museum</ENAMEX>, a collection donated to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">And√≥nis Ben√</ENAMEX>°ki on his death in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1954</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ben√°ki</ENAMEX> was born in a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX>, and many of the artifacts on display originate from this other ancient land, though there is a good range of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Classical</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> statuary, and collections from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Early Christian</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Byzantine</ENAMEX> eras including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> paintings by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Greco</ENAMEX>.
On the same side of the street walking away from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syntagma</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum of Cycladic</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ancient Art</ENAMEX> run under the auspices of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goulandr√≠s Foundation</ENAMEX>. This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> celebrates the art dating from before the development of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens city</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">state¬†‚Äî¬†discovered</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cyclades</ENAMEX> islands of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aegean</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">c2000‚Äì3000 b.c.</ENAMEX>) A wonderful collection of na√Øve figurines carved in marble was discovered in graves on the islands. Most of the figures are female, suggesting the worship of fertility or an <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">earth</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> religion. Maps and drawings help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> better understand this mysterious ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. In addition, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> shows <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">around 300</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX> dating from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Classical</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hellenic</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman Greece</ENAMEX> including a collection of finely preserved bronze vessels. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> is housed in a beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neo-Classical</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> designed by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Bavarian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ernst Ziller</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Othon</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Athina Stathatos</ENAMEX>, a prominent <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Athenian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX>. This has been painstakingly restored and presents a beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>-side fa√ßade.
Across <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avenue Vas</ENAMEX>. Sofias you‚Äôll find the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Byzantine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum</ENAMEX> housed in a splendid <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansion</ENAMEX> built for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sophie de Marbois</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Napoleon‚Äôs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generals</ENAMEX>. She was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stalwart</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> nationalism. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> holds a wealth of artifacts from the early <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Byzantine</ENAMEX> eras, concentrating on the religious themes that were so important in unifying the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> world at this time. The collection was amassed from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX> all across <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asia Minor</ENAMEX> (on the western coast of modern-day <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Turkey</ENAMEX>). On the ground floor, the interiors of several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX> of differing ages have been reassembled to explain the development of architectural <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">styles¬†¬†‚Äî¬†very</ENAMEX> useful if you intend to visit a range of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX> during your stay. The upper floors display excellent examples of icons and frescoes, vestments, and other religious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX>.
Immediately next door to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Byzantine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">War Museum</ENAMEX>, a modern <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> constructed during the military <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">dictatorship</ENAMEX>. Outside <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">you‚Äôll</ENAMEX> see a range of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">fighter jets</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missiles</ENAMEX>, while the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">galleries</ENAMEX> inside display historic uniforms, armor, and hand-held <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX>. Upper floors concentrate on military tactics and battle plans, examining campaigns from ancient times to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WWII</ENAMEX>.
Behind <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Evangelismos Metro</ENAMEX> statio, and next door to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hilton Hotel</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Gallery</ENAMEX>. The original compilation was boosted in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1880s</TIMEX> by a large bequest by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">art collector</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al√©xandros So√∫tzos</ENAMEX>, but the two collections were only brought together in this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">gallery</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1976</TIMEX>. Much of the permanent collection comprises <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19th- and 20th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> art and post-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Byzantine</ENAMEX> icons, though you can also find works by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Greco</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Picasso</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delacroix</ENAMEX>. 
From the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Gallery</ENAMEX> it is just a short walk past the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hilton Hotel</ENAMEX> along <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Vas</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sofias</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Megaron</ENAMEX>, a vast new national auditorium and concert <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX> now holding regular theatrical and musical performances. Look for a dramatic modern sculpture in glass depicting a human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">figure</ENAMEX> running at an extremely high speed (or blown by the wind) that graces the main intersection here.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lycabettus</ENAMEX> and Kolonaki
To the west of the bare sheer rock of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acropolis</ENAMEX> is a rival hill¬†‚Äî¬†the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">verdant</ENAMEX> pine-clad <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lycabettus</ENAMEX>, which makes an inviting diversion from the archaeological sites of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. Here you‚Äôll be able to sit in shade and listen to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX>. The hill was never settled in ancient times because there was no water supply. You can reach the upper slopes by funicular. When you reach the top <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">station</ENAMEX>, walk to the small chapels of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Ayios Isidoros and Ayios Georgios¬†‚Äî¬†center of the Easter celebrations</ENAMEX> for the city¬†‚Äî¬†a modern amphitheater for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> performances, and wonderful views across <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> where major attractions are pointed out on marble <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">panoramas</ENAMEX>. Though there are fixed telescopes here, having your own binoculars is a boon to really take in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">detail</ENAMEX>.
Surrounding the lower slopes of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lycabettus</ENAMEX> on the south and west <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sides</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kolonaki</ENAMEX>, perhaps the most fashionable district of central <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Apartments</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> here are much sought after as they sit among chic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boutiques</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">designer stores</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bars</ENAMEX>. It is one of the best parts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> to eat out in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the evening</TIMEX> with a range of good international eateries in addition to traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> tavernas.
Excursions
There‚Äôs no doubt that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> is a fascinating <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, but with the rush of traffic and the push of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowds</ENAMEX>, even these attractions can begin to pall after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few days</TIMEX>. Luckily you are perfectly placed to take in numerous excursions for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> or a few <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">days¬†‚Äî¬†either</ENAMEX> on an organized itinerary or under your own steam. This <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> break can truly be a ‚Äúthree- <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">or four</NUMEX>-in-one‚Äù vacation if you wish.
Piraeus
Situated <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only 10 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6 miles</NUMEX>) south of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX>, and almost indistinguishable from the sprawling capital, is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Piraeus</ENAMEX>. This <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over half a million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> is actually the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metropolis</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX>, and is its largest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port</ENAMEX>. Although many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> simply use <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Piraeus</ENAMEX> as a departure point for the myriad <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> islands of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aegean</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> has its own attractions, being settled since ancient times. 
This was not the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port</ENAMEX> that served the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>-state of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> because it could not be seen from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> and was therefore vulnerable to attack. It was first settled around <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">500 b.c.</TIMEX> when long defensive walls were built from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> to the sea. By the time of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philip of Macedon</ENAMEX> it had become a thriving commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX>. Though it fell into decline, as did <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX>, through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late first and second millennium</TIMEX>, it was re-energized following independence. Its location so close to the new capital ensured its commercial success. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> Piraeus is, above all, a working <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> with some less than prosperous <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">areas</ENAMEX>. Stay on the main thoroughfares as you explore.
Taking the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metro</ENAMEX> (the overland electric railway section) from downtown <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> costs <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">only 250drs</TIMEX> and brings you directly to the waterside. Huge quaysides in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Main Harbor</ENAMEX> cater to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of ferries large and small, and you‚Äôll see fleets of large container <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX> laying anchor offshore. Walking south along the quaysides brings you to a small shady <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cathedral of Agia Triada</ENAMEX> on its northern flank. Take this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dimokratias</ENAMEX>) to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Town Hall</ENAMEX> and visit the lively <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> market that takes place in the surrounding <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>.
Take a right down <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lampraki</ENAMEX> to reach the pretty harbor of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zea</ENAMEX>. This is one of the marinas used for pleasure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">craft</ENAMEX>, and where <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Athenians¬†‚Äî¬†rich</ENAMEX> and not so rich¬†‚Äî¬†moor their <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX>. These range from simple rowing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> of just <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a few feet</NUMEX> in length to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">hundred-foot</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ocean-going vessels</ENAMEX>. A wide promenade‚<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">ÄÇ¬†‚Äî¬†Akti Moutsopoulou¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†frames the bay and this is where local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> come to stroll in the evenings and on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">weekends¬†‚Äî¬†‚ÄÇyou</ENAMEX> can sit at a portside caf√© and watch the world go by.
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">North</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Zea</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">harbor</ENAMEX> is another pretty harbor, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mikrolimani</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Small Harbor</ENAMEX>) or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tourkolimani</ENAMEX>, where you‚Äôll find the fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">fleet</ENAMEX> and some good <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tavernas</ENAMEX>. Or head south towards the main historical attractions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Piraeus</ENAMEX>.
From the south side of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Zea</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">harbor</ENAMEX> it is only a short walk to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Archaeological Museum of Piraeus</ENAMEX>. The rather dour building hides a treasure-trove of statuary and other artifacts found during excavation of the ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrines</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, and communal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agora</ENAMEX>. Pride of place goes to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Piraeus Kouros</ENAMEX>, the oldest full-size bronze figure depicting the god <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apollo</ENAMEX>. On the grounds of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> are scant remains of the ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Theater of Zea</ENAMEX>.
Walking further south along the promenade past remnants of the ancient sea wall brings you to another small bay where you will find the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hellenic Maritime Museum</ENAMEX>, a semicircular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> with small garden in front complete with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cannon</ENAMEX>. Rooms display an eclectic series of artifacts with dioramas of the great <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Battle of Salamis in 480 b.c.</ENAMEX>, letters from the naval <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heroes</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> independence, and numerous items salvaged from the seas around the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Attica</ENAMEX> coastline.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saronic Islands</ENAMEX>
The islands closest to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> are those of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Saronic Gulf</ENAMEX>, the nearest <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">only 40 minutes</TIMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Piraeus</ENAMEX> by hydrofoil. These represent a total contrast to the bustle of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> and a perfect antidote to the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">acres</NUMEX> of concrete you find there.
Hydrofoils for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saronic</ENAMEX> islands depart from Quay I at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Piraeus Harbor</ENAMEX>.

This is the closest island to the mainland and the pretty quayside of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Aegina Town</ENAMEX>, with its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Neo-Classical</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>, awaits as you disembark. You‚Äôll see a pretty whitewashed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> protecting the harbor entrance. Stroll along the water‚Äôs edge past the colorful fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">fleet</ENAMEX>, have lunch at a seafront taverna, or buy some of the pistachio nuts or local <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ceramics</ENAMEX> for which the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> is famed. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Agia Marina</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">15 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">9 miles</NUMEX>) from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> on the west coast and has a good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>-friendly beach, and most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> make a trip to the nearby <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fifth century</TIMEX> b.c. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple of Aphaia</ENAMEX> for some more history.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aegina</ENAMEX> is a delight out of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX>, but can be very busy, especially on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer weekends</TIMEX>. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> are <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> for wealthy <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Athenian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>.
Poros
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Poros</ENAMEX> lies <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 152</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">500 ft</ENAMEX>) from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> mainland, off the northeastern coast of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Argolid Peninsula</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">55 minutes</TIMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Piraeus</ENAMEX> by hydrofoil. Small sailboats <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX> the narrow straits and it‚Äôs a yachtsman‚Äôs paradise in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer months</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Poros Town¬†‚Äî¬†the</ENAMEX> only settlement on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">island¬†‚Äî¬†¬†is</ENAMEX> a maze of narrow winding <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> rising up a small hill. The seafront is the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">hub</ENAMEX> of all activity with tavernas and caf√©s lining the waterside. The rest of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Poros</ENAMEX> is covered with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">verdant</ENAMEX> pine forest and the coastline is dotted with small rocky <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">coves¬†¬†‚Äî¬†¬†great</ENAMEX> for swimming and snorkeling.
A <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5-km</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3-mile</NUMEX>) hike to the interior brings you to the remains of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Temple of Poseidon</ENAMEX> where the famous <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> orator <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Demosthenes</ENAMEX> committed suicide in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">322 b.c.</TIMEX> rather than surrendering to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Great‚Äôs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX>.
Hydra 
Only <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 hour 15 minutes</TIMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> by hydrofoil, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hydra</ENAMEX> is the most exclusive of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saronic</ENAMEX> islands, and your approach into the harbor is the most dramatic. The beautiful port of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hydra Town</ENAMEX> keeps its secret hidden until the very last moment and when the panorama comes into view it‚Äôs time to get the camera ready. Above the shoreline of the narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cove</ENAMEX> lie a series of low hills, and each of these are blanketed with Neo-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Classical Italianate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansions</ENAMEX> painted in myriad dusty hues. There are no <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Hydra¬†‚Äî¬†only donkeys</ENAMEX>. No sandy beaches make the water some of the clearest in the area for snorkeling.
Still, most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> don‚Äôt visit <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hydra</ENAMEX> for any activity other than to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúsee and be seen.‚Äù In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s</TIMEX> the island was an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> it has developed into a place for the beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boutiques</ENAMEX> are some of the most exclusive in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX>, intermingled with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Bohemian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">craft</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">galleries</ENAMEX>, exclusive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, tavernas, chic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">caf√©s</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> ouzeries.
If you don‚Äôt want to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúmax‚Äù your credit card, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">don‚Äôt worry‚ÄÇ¬†‚Äî¬†Hydra</ENAMEX> has not yet lost its charm that is <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">free-</ENAMEX>of-charge. You can simply enjoy strolling along the narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> with a pretty view on each <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">corner</ENAMEX> before you <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> back to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> on the late hydrofoil.
Spetses
At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two hours</TIMEX> away from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Piraeus</ENAMEX> by hydrofoil, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spetses</ENAMEX> is the most remote of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saronic</ENAMEX> islands and less crowded with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Athenians</ENAMEX> than the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> other islands. There are some good sandy bays to enjoy, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Spetses Town¬†‚Äî¬†sleepy</ENAMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX> yet with a vibrant nightlife¬†‚Äî¬†offers a good mooring spot for sailboats. Perhaps a little too far for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a day</TIMEX> trip, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spetses</ENAMEX> could make a good option for a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-part vacation.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corinth</ENAMEX> and the Argolid
The history of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ancient Greece</ENAMEX> is littered with the feats of city-states led by great <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX>, of which <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> is of course the most famed. Within a day‚Äôs journey of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> are the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> such city-states in an area known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Argolid</ENAMEX>. These can be viewed as part of an action-packed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX> (either independently or as part of an organized tour) but make an excellent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two- or three-day</TIMEX> excursion for those who want to take it at a more gentle pace.
Corinth
In ancient times <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corinth</ENAMEX> rivaled <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> in its power and influence. It mimicked the layout of the larger <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">city¬†‚Äî¬†a</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> radiated out from the base of a rocky pinnacle that housed religious <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">temples¬†‚Äî¬†though</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corinth</ENAMEX> the hill is much higher than at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX>.
The site was first settled by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mycenaeans</ENAMEX> because it had an excellent natural water supply, and it reached its first level of prosperity around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the seventh century</TIMEX> b.c. It became <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Athens‚</ENAMEX>Äô <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enemy</ENAMEX> when it sided with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spartans</ENAMEX> during the devastating wars of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fourth century</TIMEX> b.c. but the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> recovered quickly from the defeat and had a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> period of influence that began during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the third century</TIMEX> b.c. when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philip</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macedonia</ENAMEX> made it the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corinthian League</ENAMEX>. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">195</NUMEX> b.c. it became <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of a group of independent <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Achaean League</ENAMEX>. Ravaged by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Romans</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">170</NUMEX> b.c. it rose again from the ashes and was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a bustling</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. Paul</ENAMEX> came to preach here. He won more support than in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> and planted the seeds of a very successful early <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>. Several major earthquakes in the early <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> era saw the city‚Äôs final decline.
Luckily for us the modern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corinth</ENAMEX> lies <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">several kilometers</NUMEX> to the northeast of the site and this leaves much of the ancient city for us to explore. Most prominent as you approach the site is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apollo</ENAMEX> built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the sixth century</TIMEX> b.c. and one of the oldest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Corinth</ENAMEX>. Many other remains date from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> era, including ornate entrances round the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fountain of Peirene</ENAMEX> where you can still hear the waters flowing through caves at the rear, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lechaion Road</ENAMEX> that linked the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Athens¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†with worn cart tracks clearly visible in the marble slabs. The site <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> has some interesting finds and has a number of dioramas depicting <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Corinth</ENAMEX> as it would once have looked.
After visiting the ancient city <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> up the hill to take in the magnificent site of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Acrocorinth</ENAMEX> standing sentinel above. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fortified</ENAMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the seventh century</TIMEX> b.c. the summit is criss-crossed with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">miles</NUMEX> of high stone walls dating from this time that were expanded during the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Byzantine</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottoman</ENAMEX> eras. At the summit, within <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> layers of protective wall, are the remains of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple of Aphrodite</ENAMEX>, an early <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christian Basilica</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Byzantine</ENAMEX> cisterns, a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Frankish Tower</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottoman</ENAMEX> mosques and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">fountains¬†‚Äî¬†this</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> history in a nutshell!
Though the modern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corinth</ENAMEX> has little to draw the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitor</ENAMEX>, a modern engineering marvel lies just outside its boundary. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Corinth Canal</ENAMEX> cuts the narrow isthmus that links the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peloponnese</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> mainland and splits the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Saronic Gulf</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gulf of Corinth</ENAMEX> (this links to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adriatic</ENAMEX> further west). Sailing around the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peloponnese</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> not only added extra time to the journey, but also carried <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX> through some of the most dangerous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mediterranean¬†¬†‚Äî¬†¬†especially</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the winter</TIMEX>. Ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greeks</ENAMEX> did not attempt to sail around but portaged their huge vessels across the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4 mile</NUMEX>) wide isthmus, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">as early as a.d. 67</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Emperor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nero</ENAMEX> was making the first attempts at cutting a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canal</ENAMEX>. It would not become reality for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">another 1,825 years</TIMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1893</TIMEX> after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eleven</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> of digging, a channel <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">70 m</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">328 ft</ENAMEX>) deep, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">25 m</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">85</NUMEX> ft) wide with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">8 m</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX> ft) of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> opened for shipping, taking a single <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ship</ENAMEX> at a time between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> gulfs.
The Argolid
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">From the 15th</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 11th century</TIMEX> b.c., this rocky peninsula was one of the most important <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> in the known world. It was from here that the mighty <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mycenaean</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX> grew to encompass mainland <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX> and the northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Aegean</ENAMEX> islands. The exploits of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mycenaeans</ENAMEX>, and their greatest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Agamemnon</ENAMEX>, were thought to be myth, until the archaeologist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heinrich Schliemann</ENAMEX> set out to find evidence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Homer‚</ENAMEX>Äôs stories of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Troy</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mycenae</ENAMEX>. He was successful in doing both, and transformed the world of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">archaeology¬†‚Äî¬†and man‚</ENAMEX>Äôs view of history.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schliemann</ENAMEX> found the remains of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mycenae</ENAMEX> buried under <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> worth of debris in a sheltered valley some <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">60 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">40 miles</NUMEX>) south of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corinth</ENAMEX>. It was so well hidden that the site had been completely forgotten, and it surprisingly had not been plundered by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">robbers</ENAMEX>. The military might of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mycenaeans</ENAMEX> had been well documented by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Homer</ENAMEX>, but nothing could prepare the archaeologists for the artistic treasures found at the site. As they dug through the remains, the tombs of several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">kings</ENAMEX> were discovered; each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">skeleton</ENAMEX> lay where it had been carefully buried, the faces covered in a mask of pure <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX>. Exquisite statuary and intricate jewelry found in the family tombs below show a softer side of these enigmatic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and brought the world of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agamemnon</ENAMEX> to life. All the artifacts from the site were taken to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> and many are now on display in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Archaeological Museum</ENAMEX>.
The archaeological site of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mycenae</ENAMEX>, now stripped of its treasures, still makes a majestic scene though it is rather smaller than one might imagine. The large <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Cyclopean Walls‚ÄÇ¬†‚Äî¬†huge</ENAMEX> rough-hewn blocks of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">granite</ENAMEX> laid one atop another with extreme <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">precision¬†‚Äî¬†are</ENAMEX> so called because their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enemies</ENAMEX> could not believe that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> could be responsible for the construction and gave the credit to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-eyed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">giant</ENAMEX> of myth. These date from around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1250</TIMEX> b.c. and surround and protect the inner sanctum through which the only entrance is the world-famous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lion‚Äôs Gate</ENAMEX> decorated with the earliest known monumental sculpture in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>.
Immediately as you enter the compound you can get a bird‚Äôs-eye view of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grave Circle A</ENAMEX>, where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal</ENAMEX> grave shafts were found, and then climb to the top of the settlement to view the remains of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Palace</ENAMEX>. From here the views of the surrounding rolling countryside are magnificent.
Half <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a mile</NUMEX> below the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> is an immense <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beehive</ENAMEX> tomb cut into the hillside and lined with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stone</ENAMEX> blocks. The acoustics inside the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tomb</ENAMEX> are very precise, exaggerating the sound of your approaching fellow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>. If a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">schoolchildren</ENAMEX> arrive to test out the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tomb</ENAMEX>, it may be a good idea to beat a hasty retreat for the sake of your ears!
Further east from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mycenae</ENAMEX> is another ancient site also renowned for its acoustics. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Theater of Epidauros</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Epidavros</ENAMEX>), was built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fourth century</TIMEX> b.c. and could hold an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. Live performances still take place here <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every summer</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">theater</ENAMEX> does not sit in splendid isolation but was part of a large settlement based around the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sanctuary of Asklepios¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†one of the most important <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> of healing in the ancient world. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> there is little left of the site and it is difficult to imagine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">spas</ENAMEX>, and faith-healing practices catering to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">travelers</ENAMEX> from across the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> world.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nafplio</ENAMEX> makes the perfect base for touring the area, or perhaps a spot to have lunch while on your tour. Set on the south coast of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Argolid</ENAMEX>, it has been a strategic strongpoint for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX> and boasts no less than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> castles dating from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Byzantine</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Venetian times¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†on far more ancient foundations¬<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">†‚Äî¬†called Akronafplia Castle</ENAMEX>. The modern settlement has an urbane gentility with an old-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of grand <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italianate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansions</ENAMEX> linked by cobbled walkways. Pretty tavernas set tables out in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> and tempt you with fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seafood</ENAMEX> caught by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the small</TIMEX> fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> in the harbor. The seaside promenade flanked by smart caf√©s is where you‚Äôll find <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locals</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Athenians</ENAMEX> alike strolling in the cooling <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</TIMEX> air. Look out towards the tiny fortified island of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bourzi</ENAMEX>; you can even take a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> trip to explore the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> if time allows.
Sounion
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">windswept</ENAMEX> peninsula of southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Attica</ENAMEX> reaches out towards the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Aegean Sea</ENAMEX>, and at its very tip (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">70 km/43 miles</NUMEX> south of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX>) the ancients built a beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Poseidon</ENAMEX>, the God of that watery realm. The views from here are beautiful whatever the time of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">day¬†‚Äî¬†but the sunsets</ENAMEX> are particularly spectacular.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> itself is one of the finest in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX>. Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</NUMEX> Doric columns <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 15</NUMEX> are still in situ, and the ornate frieze on the pediment and entablature has been ravaged by the salty air, but the whole effect of the building combined with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">setting¬†‚Äî¬†with</ENAMEX> beach on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> side and sheer drop on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">other¬†‚Äî¬†is magnificent</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sounion</ENAMEX> is reached by following the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">coast</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> from the capital down through several lovely <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX> with private beaches. Glyf√°da is the closest to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vouliagm√</ENAMEX>©ni is the furthest away.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daphni</ENAMEX> and Eleusis
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> has a beautiful downtown <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">area</ENAMEX> but it is one of the largest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, and it also has an industrial element mostly based around the southern and eastern suburbs. Incongruous among the landscapes of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">refineries</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factories</ENAMEX> you‚Äôll find historical gems to explore. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Ten</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kilometers</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6 miles</NUMEX>) west of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monastery of Daphni</ENAMEX> (soon to be linked with the downtown <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">area</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metro</ENAMEX> extension) built on the site of an earlier <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apollo</ENAMEX>. Founded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fifth or sixth century</TIMEX> a.d., the site was refurbished and extended in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 11th century</TIMEX> but sacked and abandoned before being occupied by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Orthodox</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">monks</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16th century</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Restoration</ENAMEX> took place after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WWII</ENAMEX> and again in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s</TIMEX>. The pretty <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Byzantine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">c1080</NUMEX>) has a stone-and-tile <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dome exterior</ENAMEX> but is famed throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX> for the fantastic mosaics that decorate the interior, particularly that of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christ Pantocrator</ENAMEX> in the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dome</ENAMEX>.
Through this same industrial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">area</ENAMEX> runs the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sacred Way</ENAMEX> that linked <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eleusis</ENAMEX>. In ancient times the way was lined with <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrines</ENAMEX> and tombs, which are now and again brought to light when redevelopment takes place. Eleusis was home to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sanctuary of Demeter</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Eleusian Mysteries¬†‚Äî¬†a</ENAMEX> series of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> and enigmatic rituals only performed by initiates of the order. The order thrived from the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Mycenaean</ENAMEX> era to the coming of Christianity. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Annual</TIMEX> celebrations to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Demeter</ENAMEX> took place in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each September</TIMEX>, with a public festival and a secret religious rite that transformed chosen <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">followers</ENAMEX> into initiates of the secrets. A procession would leave <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eleusis</ENAMEX> and walk along the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Sacred</ENAMEX> Way entering <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> via the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Sacred Gate</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kerameikos</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">49</NUMEX>) before proceeding to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acropolis</ENAMEX>.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Eleusis</ENAMEX> the sacred way led directly to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sanctuary of Demeter</ENAMEX> and a large <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Temple of Artemis</ENAMEX> with a forecourt where the initiates would gather in preparation for the procession. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">great</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Propylaia</ENAMEX> marked the entrance to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">town‚ÄÇ¬†‚Äî¬†a</ENAMEX> copy of that at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acropolis</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Precinct of Demeter</ENAMEX> lay in a walled <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>, and its inner sanctum, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Periklean Telesterion</ENAMEX>, where only initiates were allowed to enter, sat within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX>. You will also find the remains of more mundane structures such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bouleuterion</ENAMEX> and gymnasium. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> on site displays extremely good artifacts found among the ruins.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delphi</ENAMEX>
Where the mysteries of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eleusis</ENAMEX> were only open to a few initiates, advice from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oracle</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delphi</ENAMEX> was open to all. It was simply a matter of making your way to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sanctuary</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apollo</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">now three hours</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> to the northwest. In ancient times this was the spiritual center of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> world and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> would travel by land or sea to consult the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">gods</ENAMEX>. No important decisions of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> could be made without consulting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oracle</ENAMEX> here, and when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colossus of Rhodes</ENAMEX> was toppled in an earthquake the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>-state in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aegean</ENAMEX> left it where it lay after advice from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oracle</ENAMEX> not to rebuild it.
There has been a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> here since pre-historic times when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gaia the Earth-Mother</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">goddess</ENAMEX> was worshipped. Even in these early times the gods would be consulted with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">oracle</ENAMEX> issuing their verdicts from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Rock of Sybil</ENAMEX>. Later, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Olympian gods usurped Gaia</ENAMEX> but the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">sanctuary</ENAMEX> retained its role. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Legend</ENAMEX> says that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">God Apollo</ENAMEX> arrived at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delphi</ENAMEX> by sea on a dolphin and slayed the monstrous python that guarded the entrance to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">sanctuary</ENAMEX>. Thus the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> was named in his honor.
A modern <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> cuts through the remains and the approach to the site from the parking lot leads <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman Agora</ENAMEX>, where pilgrims would stock up on supplies and offerings for the temple <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">only a few minutes</TIMEX> away. Here you can see the remains of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sanctuary</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apollo</ENAMEX>, the nearby waters of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kastalian Springs</ENAMEX> where pilgrims would purify themselves before their consultation, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Rock of Sybil</ENAMEX> where the oracle proclaimed the verdict of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">gods</ENAMEX>. The modern <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> has a wonderful collection of statuary, treasure, and other artifacts found at the site.
Below the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> are the remains of a large gymnasium, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Athena Pronaia</ENAMEX> where pilgrims would make their <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> religious <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stop</ENAMEX> on the climb to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">sanctuary</ENAMEX>. Its tholos (columned rotunda) is set in a beautiful wooded lot with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">sanctuary</ENAMEX> on the hillside behind.
