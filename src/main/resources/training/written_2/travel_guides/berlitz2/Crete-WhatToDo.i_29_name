Sports
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beach Activities</ENAMEX>
C rete has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of beaches, from tiny coves to lengthy strands. You can choose to spend <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">your day</TIMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, or have the sand all to yourself at a remote spot. Beaches in the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX> have well-organized watersports <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">jet</ENAMEX>-skis and water rides, kayaking and parasailing behind speed <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX>. The best are at √Ågios <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nik√≥laos, Hers√≥nissos, M√°lia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ag√≠a Pelag√≠a</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">R√</ENAMEX>©thymnon on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">north</ENAMEX> coast.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South coast</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX> tend to be more low key than their northern counterparts. Beaches tend to be smaller, in bays rather than in long stretches of shoreline. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">You‚Äôll</ENAMEX> find the most diverse range of beach activities at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M√°tala</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ag√≠a Gal√≠ni</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plaki√°s.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">V√°√Ø</ENAMEX>, in the far northeastern corner, is considered the best beach on the island, and for this reason it gets busy in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX>. Out of the way beaches where you can find some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">solitude</ENAMEX> tend to lie down narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tortuous roads</ENAMEX> in remote parts of the island. Try <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xer√≥kampos</ENAMEX> south of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Z√°kros</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> east from <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Mon√≠ Pr√</ENAMEX>©veli to the sandy stretches around tiny <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ag√≠a Fotini</ENAMEX>.
Walking and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hiking</ENAMEX>
This is an ideal island to put on your walking boots and take to the countryside. You will be well-rewarded, with small remote <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX>, hidden <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX>, and a rural lifestyle to explore. Though <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cretans</ENAMEX> are bemused as to why anyone would want to hike without any purpose but the pleasure of it, they have a genuine welcome for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">travelers</ENAMEX> on foot. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Itineraries</ENAMEX> can range from easy flat short walks to steep mountain hikes, though it‚Äôs not advisable to head into the high peaks without a guide.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gorge</ENAMEX> walks are particularly popular; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Samari√</ENAMEX>° is the busiest and the longest. Other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gorge</ENAMEX> walks include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Imbros</ENAMEX> near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Samari√°</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Valley</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dead</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Z√</ENAMEX>°kros on the eastern coast. The peninsulas off the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">northwest</ENAMEX> coast present dramatic and interesting walks. Akrot√≠ri is the most populated though not as rugged as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gramvo√∫ssa</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rod√≥pou</ENAMEX>, which are wild and windswept. Shorter itineraries could include the walk from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agii D√</ENAMEX>©ka to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">G√≥rtis</ENAMEX>; from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M√</ENAMEX>°lia to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Minoan</ENAMEX> site to the east; or from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Am√°ri valley</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diexodos</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> that organizes guided hiking tours either by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> or longer. They can supply equipment and extra insurance if you need it. Contact them at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tel</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">/</ENAMEX>fax (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0841</TIMEX>) 28098.
Biking
Many of these same itineraries can be covered on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">wheels</ENAMEX> as well as on <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">two feet</NUMEX>, and mountain biking and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bike</ENAMEX> touring are becoming more popular. Once into the hinterland however, you will need some stamina to make it up the hills and mountain passes. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diexodos</ENAMEX> also organizes bike <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">tours</ENAMEX> (see details above), or you can rent equipment in all the major <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX> and plan your own itinerary. 
Diving and Snorkeling
The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX> around the island offer some interesting diving and snorkeling opportunities for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lovers</ENAMEX> with all levels of underwater experience. Although the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean Sea</ENAMEX> is rather overfished and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX> are not warm enough to support brightly colored tropical <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>, there are still numerous varieties to spot in the rocky shallows, including octopi that make their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> in tiny crevices. 
The remains of many ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> lie just off the coastline. At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Elo√</ENAMEX>∫nda you can explore the remains of √ìlous, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M√°tala</ENAMEX> has a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX> and harbor <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pier</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> is concerned that archaeological treasures do not disappear and for this reason diving is only allowed with a qualified dive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> that will oversee underwater locations and activities.
If you have never scuba-dived before, each dive <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> is registered by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> to offer training in addition to dive supervision for qualified <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">divers</ENAMEX>. All <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> are affiliated with one of the major certifying bodies; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PADI</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Professional Association of Diving Instructors</ENAMEX>) is the most common. The basic qualification, the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Open Water</ENAMEX> certificate, takes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five days</TIMEX> to complete. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> also offer an introductory session commonly known as the ‚ÄúDiscover SCUBA Program.‚Äù This involves a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning or afternoon</TIMEX> of theory and shallow water work, giving you the chance to try out the basic techniques before you decide to do the full open water <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">course</ENAMEX>.
Entertainment
A huge number of fairs and festivals take place throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX>. Your local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tourist Office</ENAMEX> will have details of what‚Äôs taking place during your stay on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crete</ENAMEX>. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> celebrates its own <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Saint‚Äôs Day</ENAMEX>, or panagiraie, when the sacred statue is paraded through the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>. After a solemn religious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">service</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the rest of the day</TIMEX> is given over to revelry. These are the best places to see traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cretan</ENAMEX> dances and live music, and join in with local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> having some fun. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> at some time during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX>, so there‚Äôs sure to be an opportunity to take part. 
Zorba the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>? <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Music and Dance</ENAMEX>
For many, the image of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> music and dance is inexorably linked to the film ‚ÄúZorba the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù Anthony Quinn</ENAMEX> performs the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">syrt√°ki</ENAMEX> dance (in fact an amalgam of several different traditional dances), to the sound of the bouzo√∫ki, a stringed guitar-type instrument that produces melodic, slightly metallic sounds. When played live it has a haunting melody, but taverna <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> do have the irritating habit of playing it at high decibels through overloaded <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX>. This does a great disservice to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> musical tradition, which is rich, varied and goes back for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>. The tradition is still particularly strong on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crete</ENAMEX> where traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">musicians</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">singers</ENAMEX> are held in high regard. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">Musical rhythms</ENAMEX> were traditionally matched to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> cadences of the epic poetry of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX>. These are very different from the ‚Äòfour beats to a bar‚Äô that characterizes the western musical tradition, and therefore it is sometimes difficult for Western <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">listeners</ENAMEX> to follow. Songs have traditionally been sung by men‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇrelating the hard life of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmer</ENAMEX> or fisherman and including an element of sentimentality rarely expressed in other areas of a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> male‚Äôs life.
Each <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX> has its own particular songs and dances. The music of the southern islands is called nisiotika, while in the northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Aegean</ENAMEX> there is a style called sandouri. Most <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> also have a syrtos dance, steps performed in the round.
Crete‚Äôs main traditional musical instrument is the lyra, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX>-shaped stringed instrument. This is usually accompanied by the laouto, a variation of the mandolin; the askomantoura, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cretan</ENAMEX> bagpipes; and the habioli, the shepherd‚Äôs flute. The instruments are brought together in mantinada songs with rhyming couplets of lyrics. Many of these have been passed down through <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cretans</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fighters</ENAMEX> of the western <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">mountains</ENAMEX> had their own songs, the rizitika, with lyrics praising bravery and patriotism. The mountain <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> also have their own dances. The steps of the tsam√≠ko are slow and grand, reinforcing the status of these heroic figures. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">R√©thymnon</ENAMEX> has its own dance, the so√∫sta, with hopping steps. You can also try the pendozalis.
Chanting epic poetry is also a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cretan</ENAMEX> tradition that has been carried through the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX>. This would have strengthened the bonds of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lonely</ENAMEX> and frightened young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fighters</ENAMEX> and stirred their blood before action. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">The 17th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Erot√≥kritos</ENAMEX>, written by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vinz√©tzos Korn√°ros</ENAMEX>, is the most popular of these. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">R√©thymnon</ENAMEX> holds a number of festivals throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX> with the municipal gardens and fortress the usual venues. The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July</TIMEX> Music <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Festival</ENAMEX> is followed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Renaissance Festival</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August</TIMEX>. This includes numerous classical performances.
The larger <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> will usually hold a ‚ÄòGreek‚Äô <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</TIMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one night</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each week</TIMEX>. The music and dance is usually of a high standard, though the surroundings can be less than authentic. The settlement of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ano Hers√≥nissos</ENAMEX>, just inland from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX>, holds a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekly</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> evening in the village <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>. It‚Äôs full of atmosphere and there is a selection of tavernas where you can enjoy a meal while watching the show. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dionysos Restaurant</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Limnes</ENAMEX> near √Ågios <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nik√≥laos</ENAMEX> also holds music and dance evenings.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shopping</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shopping</ENAMEX> is one of the delights of a trip to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crete</ENAMEX> and souvenirs abound in all ranges of price and quality. Many souvenir <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> in the major <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX> tend to cater to the popular; however, you don‚Äôt need to look far to find locally produced goods that make wonderful remembrances of your trip and the narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> of the old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> are the perfect places to browse for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX>.
Prices can be flexible, particularly in tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> and at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the beginning and end of the season</TIMEX>, so don‚Äôt seem too eager to pay the ticket price.
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Textiles</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Wool</ENAMEX> and goat <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hair</ENAMEX> have always been used to produce <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">material</ENAMEX>, clothing, and interesting rugs, carpets, and throws. You can still buy handmade <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pieces‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇhyfanda ‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇwith traditional designs, or machine-produced items. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brighter</ENAMEX> colors often indicate synthetic dyes, whereas traditionally-made items are still made with the muted earthy colors of natural dyes. The price differential will also indicate the difference between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Dolphins</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> are popular themes, as are stylized images of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gods</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">You‚Äôll</ENAMEX> find particularly interesting ranges in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Krits√°</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">An√≥gia</ENAMEX>, along with the approach to the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictaean Cave in Las√≠thi</ENAMEX>, and in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chani√°.</ENAMEX>
If rugged textiles <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">don‚</ENAMEX>Äôt appeal, then you‚Äôll also find beautiful embroidered items such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">cotton</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">linen tablecloths</ENAMEX> and napkins. Again the hand-embroidered <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pieces</ENAMEX> are the best and the most expensive, but this skill is a dying art, so good examples will become harder to find. You will, however, have plenty of everyday tablecloths to choose from in markets and the main tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leather Goods</ENAMEX>
Leather goods have been extremely good value in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many years</TIMEX>. Bags, purses, luggage, and belts can be found in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">abundance‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇtry Od√≥s</ENAMEX> Skridl√≥f (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Leather Street</ENAMEX>) in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chani√</ENAMEX>° to begin comparing quality and prices.
The traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">leather sandals</ENAMEX> (flat soles with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">leather straps</ENAMEX>) are still sold in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">R√©thymnon</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chani√°.</ENAMEX> There is also a workshop at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Krits√°</ENAMEX>, but these days modern mass-produced fashion shoes seem to be invading the scene. Hopefully this won‚Äôt signal the demise of this comfortable and casual footwear. 
You can also purchase a pair of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Cretan farmer‚Äôs boots ‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇalmost knee</ENAMEX>-high black leather with thick leather soles. They are guaranteed to last a lifetime, and judging by the number of well-worn pairs on feet in the hinterland, it certainly seems to be the truth. These are handmade and will take <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about one week</TIMEX> to complete.
Edibles
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crete</ENAMEX> is exporting elements of its healthy diet and the seasonal gluts that used to see farming <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the winter</TIMEX> now end up on tables in lands far away. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Olives</ENAMEX> and olive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> are obvious choices to take home. The quality of both is excellent and considered the best in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX>. Particularly good are the extra virgin cold pressed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oils</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sit√≠a</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toplo√∫</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ag√≠a Tri√°da.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Honey</ENAMEX> is also one of the prime staples of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cretan</ENAMEX> diet. Wild <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">herbs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> on the hills impart a wonderful flavor, and you can buy it plain or with nuts added.
Herbs are collected and dried for you to take home and use in your cooking. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Basil</ENAMEX>, thyme, and oregano are the most common, though you can also buy mixed sachets. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dittany</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">d√≠ktamus</ENAMEX>) is a popular Cretan <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">herb</ENAMEX> that is boiled to make <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX>.
Clothing
You don‚Äôt really need to pack a suitcase before you travel. You can buy everything you need for your vacation here. <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">Greek cotton</ENAMEX> is manufactured into a range of good value cool cotton clothing that is perfect for touring and exploring. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shorts</ENAMEX>, pants, shirts, and dresses hang against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">alley</ENAMEX> walls in all the major <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX>; it‚Äôs just a matter of finding a style that you like. 
Early and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late in the season</TIMEX> you‚Äôll be able to buy good quality cotton sweaters to guard against the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</TIMEX> chills. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Cream</ENAMEX> and blue are the most popular colors.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Stores</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ir√°klion</ENAMEX> stock all the major <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designer</ENAMEX> street names along with many <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> labels. There‚Äôs not much differential from other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX> prices. 
Art and Icons
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Artists</ENAMEX> flocked to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chani√</ENAMEX>° in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s and 70s</TIMEX>, and this has left a legacy in the quality of work on sale here (and to a lesser extent throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crete</ENAMEX>). You will find a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">galleries</ENAMEX> displaying work by local and international <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> in the narrow alleyways of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">√âvr√©ika Quarter</ENAMEX>.
A more <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> form of art is that of the icon. An icon is a religious portrait, usually of a saint or apostle. These were a development from the fayum paintings that covered the face of the dead in the sarcophagi of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Egyptian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mummies</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Icons</ENAMEX> lie at the heart of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Byzantine or Orthodox</ENAMEX> worship and they form a focus for prayer. The characteristic gold leaf used in their production symbolized the glory of God. 
For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX> they were popular souvenirs of the grand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Tour</ENAMEX> or religious pilgrimage. However, modern production methods, including thin artificial canvas and gaudy synthetic colors, saw them lose favor.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX> there has been a rebirth in icon painting using traditional methods, both for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> renovations, and for commercial sale. This time-consuming work is exquisite and correspondingly expensive. Most monasteries on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crete</ENAMEX> create certified copies of their most celebrated icons and you can also find them in jewelry <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> and specialty <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX>.
Jewelry
Both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">silver</ENAMEX> are sold by weight with relatively little extra cost for workmanship, so they represent good value. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ancient Minoan</ENAMEX> patterns are common with necklaces, bracelets, and rings in matching sets. You can also find precious and semi-precious set-stone items.
However, you don‚Äôt need a large budget to buy trinkets, as there is a plethora of popular street jewelry for sale with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">leather</ENAMEX>, semi-precious <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stones</ENAMEX>, and crystals.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pottery and Ceramics</ENAMEX>
It‚Äôs not surprising, given the importance of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ceramics</ENAMEX> and pottery throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Crete‚</ENAMEX>Äôs history, that it is still a significant industry. Pieces come as small as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ring holder</ENAMEX> or olive bowl to huge garden pieces that would have to be shipped back home. Both unglazed and ceramic styles are available; most notable of these is the bright blue glaze of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Chani√° ceramics</ENAMEX>. Traditional designs abound, including marine themes, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Minoan</ENAMEX> designs, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Classical Greek</ENAMEX> imagery. Modern free-form pieces can also be found, particularly in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chani√°</ENAMEX> where there are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">galleries</ENAMEX> stocked by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">avant-garde potters</ENAMEX>. At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marger√</ENAMEX>≠tes you can watch the potters at work and buy from their workshops.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Children‚Äôs Crete</ENAMEX>
A visit to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crete</ENAMEX> isn‚Äôt all about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX> and ancient sites. <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">There‚Äôs</NUMEX> lots of fun to be had for younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> society is very family-oriented and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> will be very welcome at tavernas and caf√©s.
Beach activities are well-organized on the northern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">coast</ENAMEX>, with all types of watersports and rides. The best sandy beaches are at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M√°lia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">R√©thymnon</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Georgi√≥upolis</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">V√°√Ø</ENAMEX>, with organized activities at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ag√≠a Pelag√≠a.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South coast</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plaki√°s</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M√</ENAMEX>°tala have good beaches and plenty of snorkeling opportunities for older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>. Don‚Äôt forget that the sun can be very strong in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX>. Always make sure that young skin is adequately protected‚Äîeven when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> are playing in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>.
Waterparks at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hers√≥nissos</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M√°lia</ENAMEX> will keep them busy and wet for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX>.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horse</ENAMEX> and carriage ride through the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chani√</ENAMEX>° is a great treat and gives young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> a good vantage point. They can even sit next to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">driver</ENAMEX>.
At <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> evenings, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> usually allow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> to get up on the dance floor and try the steps themselves.
Trips along the coast in colorful ca√Øques offer the chance to enjoy a cooling breeze and an alternative view of the island.
Castles such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Koules</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ir√°klion</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Frangok√</ENAMEX>°stello allow imaginations to run wild‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇ <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dad</ENAMEX> will believe he‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Errol Flynn</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> might choose to be <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hercules</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xena</ENAMEX>.
