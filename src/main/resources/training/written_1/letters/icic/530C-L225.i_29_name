      Dear Name:
      The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indiana University School of Law</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indianapolis</ENAMEX> continues to make
      significant strides in legal education. As a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the law <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>'s
      __, I know you are aware of our progress.
      We consistently, for example, attract top <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>; the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX> entering
      class had the highest Law School <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Admission Test</ENAMEX> scores in our history and
      <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 10%</NUMEX> of our new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> possess graduate degrees in addition to
      their undergraduate diplomas. Our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>, moreover, consistently have
      the highest success rate of any law school, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">graduates</ENAMEX> on passing the
      <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indiana Bar</ENAMEX> exam. On the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 1990</TIMEX> exams, our pass rates
      were <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">96.5% and 91.4%</NUMEX>!Besides a talented and diverse student <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX>, our law
      school boasts an outstanding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">faculty</ENAMEX>. In addition to fine teaching and
      impressive scholarship, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">faculty</ENAMEX> make important professional
      contributions through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">service</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boards</ENAMEX> and commissions, participating in
      continuing legal education programs, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar association</ENAMEX> activities.
      With all our successes, the law school still has many opportunities
      for growth and improvement. It takes a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partnership</ENAMEX> of private support and
      University funding to sustain and expand our leadership role in legal
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">education</ENAMEX>.
      The law <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library houses</ENAMEX> the most highly automated legal research
      collection in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. However, dramatic increases in the costs of law
      books, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX>, and database services mean that simply maintaining our
      present collections exceeds our budget.
      Our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">faculty</ENAMEX>-student ratio is <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1:27</TIMEX>. For law <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
      <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX>, the range of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">faculty</ENAMEX>-student ratios is <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">from 1:13 to 1:35</TIMEX>, but
      well <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over half</NUMEX> of the law <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> have better ratios than
      we do.
      Competition among law <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> for the strongest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> is intense.
      Scholarships often are critical in enrolling top <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> in financial
      need. During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX>, the law <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> had <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">only $130,000</NUMEX> in scholarships to
      award <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>.
      After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty years</TIMEX>, the law school <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> needs considerable
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">refurbishing</ENAMEX>, especially in areas used by our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>. While we don't
      attract capable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> or outstanding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">faculty</ENAMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> alone, it
      is important that we maintain an attractive environment for maximum
      learning.
      As a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> of the law school, I urge you to consider a significant
      <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> gift of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">at least $1,000</NUMEX> and become a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the Maennerchor
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Society</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Members</ENAMEX> of this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, through their leadership, continue to
      demonstrate that private support can lead to significant improvements at
      the law <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>. Your gift can be made in one payment, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> semi-annual
      payments, or on a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">quarterly</TIMEX> basis.
      Your <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> gift to the law <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> is an investment in its continued
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">excellence</ENAMEX>.
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sincerely</ENAMEX>,
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norman Lefstein Dean</ENAMEX>
