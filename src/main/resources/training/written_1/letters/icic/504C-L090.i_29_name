      <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dear</ENAMEX> (Name):
      The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">holiday season</TIMEX> is now upon us and I'd like to wish you much
      happiness as we wind down <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> and begin another. Among the many
      traditions of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the holiday season</TIMEX> is taking time to reflect upon the
      things in our lives that add meaning. It is also a time to review our
      personal giving and consider gifts to our favorite <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>. As you
      review the gifts you've made this year I please consider a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year-end</TIMEX> gift
      to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Herron School of Art</ENAMEX>. Your gift of any amount will help the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> and
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">gallery</ENAMEX> continue its longstanding excellence in preparing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> of
      <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX>.
      We are proud to report that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Herron School of Art</ENAMEX> has made some
      facility repairs <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> including much needed new coats of paint in
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">studios</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hallways</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fesler</ENAMEX>. The old kiln shed
      has been replaced and our newly occupied and totally renovated
      photography building on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Michigan Street</ENAMEX> has been in use for the first
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>. In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Herron</ENAMEX> computer <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> are now connected to the
      world-wide Internet system which opens great new opportunities for our
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">faculty</ENAMEX>.
      All these repairs, along with support for our outstanding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">faculty</ENAMEX>, the
      provision for exciting visiting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> and exhibitions at the Herron
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Gallery</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> scholarships/awards are essential to the continued
      maintenance of educational quality at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>, but they all cost
      money. Despite good financial support from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indiana University</ENAMEX> we still
      need additional assistance from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> like yourself if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> is to
      continue to progress and prosper.
      I hope you will consider a gift to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX>. A gift form
      identifying particular areas of need is attached for your reference. Any
      amount will be greatly appreciated.
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sincerely</ENAMEX>,
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William J. Voos Dean</ENAMEX>
