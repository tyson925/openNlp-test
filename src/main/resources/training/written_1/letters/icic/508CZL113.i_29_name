      Dear Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Name</ENAMEX>:
      The space age began with the launch of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sputnik</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 1957</TIMEX>. This
      remarkable accomplishment happened during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first semester</TIMEX> of my junior
      <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DePauw University</ENAMEX> where, by sheer coincidence, I was being
      severely challenged by an "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Introduction to Classical Mechanics</ENAMEX>," where I
      was studying the equations of gravity and orbital motion as taught by Dr.
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Correll</ENAMEX>. Believe me, I never dreamed that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">some 25 years later</TIMEX> my life
      would depend on my precise understanding of real-time solutions to these
      same equations. Had I known such strange events would occur, I assure you
      I would have spent much more time studying physics in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minshall Lab</ENAMEX> and
      less time playing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hub</ENAMEX>. The point is, the liberal arts
      education you and I received at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DePauw</ENAMEX> gave us the tools to learn, and
      I'm convinced, instilled in us the curiosity to keep learning. In our
      changing world, the sky is no longer the boundary to our travels. In our
      changing world, there are likewise no boundaries to where a DePauw
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">education</ENAMEX> can lead us.
      That's why I'm writing to you and asking for your help in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX>'s
      <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Annual</TIMEX> Fund.
      Why should we support <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DePauw</ENAMEX>? Simply stated, we must offer the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,100</NUMEX>
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> now enrolled at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University</ENAMEX> those same opportunities to
      develop skills they will need to meet ever-moving challenges. Through our
      support of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Annual Fund</ENAMEX>, you and I can help continue the educational
      tradition we enjoyed --a strong foundation for a lifetime of continued
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">learning</ENAMEX> and growth. There is no doubt in my mind that the pop quizzes my
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dad</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Professor</ENAMEX> "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Perk" Allen</ENAMEX>, gave his accounting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> served an
      important purpose. His lesson of "be prepared: real life will test you
      <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX>" was carried by each of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> into their individual
      careers. It is practical advice that remains true <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>.
      Is a liberal arts education still sufficient? Some argue that the
      growing pace of technology makes a liberal arts education less valuable
      in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the '90s</TIMEX>. I believe just the opposite. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">liberal</ENAMEX> arts education is
      even more valuable <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> precisely because technology outdates itself so
      rapidly. The ability to keep learning, to keep discovering, and to keep
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inventing</ENAMEX> becomes even more important if we are to compete in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX>'s
      world.
      For example, when I was at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DePauw</ENAMEX>, the most "technical" educational
      experience I can remember was visiting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> east of Greencastle
      to observe the manufacture of computer cards. This was the future! Yet
      those cards quickly became obsolete as computers shrank in size and new
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>-handling technologies were invented. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> we can readily buy
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lap-top</ENAMEX> computers with data storage capacity far greater than that entire
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factory</ENAMEX> could have offered.
      Yes, as a science <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DePauw</ENAMEX> I did learn the methods of
      mathematics and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mechanics</ENAMEX> of physics. More importantly, I remember
      that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professors</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gass</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cook</ENAMEX> also taught us to persevere in
      the face of occasional failures and instilled in us the confidence to
      tackle complicated-sounding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> -- subjects which might be difficult
      to learn, but which could yield great rewards. And <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coaches</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike</ENAMEX>
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Snavely</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charlie Erdmann</ENAMEX> taught us about the importance of teamwork,
      not only on the playing field but in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">classroom</ENAMEX> and in the
      dormitories, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">fraternities</ENAMEX> and sororities during the course of our daily
      lives as undergraduates.
      Your memories are probably very similar. Regardless of when you
      studied in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greencastle</ENAMEX>, the fact is that the only way we can keep up with
      changes of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s world is to possess the energy and the ability to
      continue learning. Through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">some 30 years</TIMEX> so far, my <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">DePauw</ENAMEX> education
      hasn't let me down. The challenges I face <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> in applying new
      technology in the manufacturing of low-cost space products depend upon my
      ability to keep learning. Believe it or not, the wondrous Sputnik
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">satellite</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1957</TIMEX> compares to a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">1990s</ENAMEX> communications satellite as those
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">obsolete IBM</ENAMEX> computer cards compare to modern disk storage <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">units</ENAMEX>.
      You have your own special memories and reasons to support <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DePauw</ENAMEX>, but
      we are all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DePauw</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classmates</ENAMEX> and
      special <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professors</ENAMEX>. My closeness to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University</ENAMEX> is strengthened by a
      family legacy which goes back <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">over 100 years</TIMEX> to my
      great-great-grandfather, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Professor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William F. Swahlen</ENAMEX>, who taught <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>
      at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indiana Asbury</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">from 1887-1914</TIMEX>, and carried on with my
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">great-grandfather</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph P. Allen</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">'97</NUMEX>; my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harriet Taylor Allen</ENAMEX>
      <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">'28</NUMEX>; my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph P. "Perk" Allen</ENAMEX> '30, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> emeritus of
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">economics</ENAMEX>; my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David T. Allen</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">'61</NUMEX>; my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bonnie Darling</ENAMEX>
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allen</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">'61</NUMEX>; and continues <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> with my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nephew</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tim Allen</ENAMEX> '92.
      Like <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mine</ENAMEX>, your ties to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DePauw</ENAMEX> are a part of a proud tradition on a
      campus where the sense of history is treasured. And these ties, coupled
      with our classroom experience, are a valuable part of our DePauw
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">education</ENAMEX>. We must pass this tradition along. Our generous gifts to the
      <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Annual</TIMEX> Fund will give <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> the opportunities that older
      alumni shared with us by making their gifts to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fund</ENAMEX>.
      <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">This year</TIMEX>, your Class of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1943</TIMEX> celebrates its golden anniversary, and
      it's time once again to reminisce about your <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DePauw</ENAMEX>. Please
      consider making a special gift <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> in honor of your reunion and
      those special memories. Your support will make a difference.
      I really believe that our support of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DePauw</ENAMEX> does matter. The DePauw
      classes of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993, 1994, 1995 and 1996</TIMEX> can make a difference in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s
      world. They matter, and our support to them matters. We must invest in
      their future and ours.
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sincerely</ENAMEX>,
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph P. "Joe" Allen</ENAMEX> '59
