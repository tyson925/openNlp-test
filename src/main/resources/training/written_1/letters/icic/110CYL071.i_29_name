      <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Dear ,</ENAMEX>
      Think of your greatest accomplishments. Think of the joy and success
      they bring to you and your loved ones.
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Sims</ENAMEX> felt that way at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 39</TIMEX> -- <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> he earned a job.
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michael</ENAMEX> was born with cerebral palsy. Upon entering the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">work force</ENAMEX>, he
      discovered few job opportunities that seemed to match his abilities.
      For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several years</TIMEX> he performed packaging and clerical work. His most
      recent job lasted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">only a year before</TIMEX> cut-backs eliminated his
      position.
      For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18 long months</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michael</ENAMEX> could not find a job. He resorted to public
      assistance dollars to survive. Finally, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Goodwill</ENAMEX>.
      At <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Goodwill</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michael</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counselors</ENAMEX> felt that his personable demeanor
      could be a major attribute and identified for him a possible job-match
      where his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> skills could shine.
      After <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> interviews, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michael</ENAMEX> proved that he was the right person
      for the job. As the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Clubhouse Monitor</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bent Tree Apartments</ENAMEX>, he now
      provides customer service for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">50 to 60 tenants each night</TIMEX>.
      At last, he has found success in a job that he loves. Now his goals
      are set on moving up in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>.
      <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Every year</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> come to <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Goodwill</ENAMEX>. Like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael</ENAMEX>, they
      share <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> common characteristics. They face some barrier to employment
      and they want to work.
      With support from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> like you, they can overcome their barriers
      and earn success and the self-sufficiency that comes with it. And then
      the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pay-off</ENAMEX> begins for the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX>.
      Individual successes at <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Goodwill</ENAMEX> mean fewer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> receiving public
      support and more paying taxes. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last year</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Goodwill</ENAMEX>
      programs earned --and paid taxes on -- wages of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">nearly $3.5 million</NUMEX>.
      Their successes at work also saved <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers</ENAMEX> more than <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three-quarters of</TIMEX>
      a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">million dollars</NUMEX> in public assistance.
      The savings are counted in more ways than dollars and cents, however.
      The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> of the new wage earners may feel the accomplishment in terms
      of a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> to live in, money to purchase <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> -- without food stamps --
      and the beginning of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> focused on success, not hopelessness.
      Won't you help make all of these successes possible? Please send the
      largest contribution you can comfortably make. Your gift will help give
      new meaning to the word success -- for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who have seldom had reason
      to use the word.
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sincerely</ENAMEX>,
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James M. McClelland President</ENAMEX>
      P.S. Your gift will make a difference. For every dollar of public
      support <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Goodwill</ENAMEX> received <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX>, we returned <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1.59</NUMEX> to the community
      in the form of earned wages and reduced public assistance payments.
