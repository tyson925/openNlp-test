      Dear Name:
      In the past, you have been generous in your support of programs in the
      School of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Liberal Arts</ENAMEX>. We have especially appreciated this generosity
      and hope you have been pleased with the growth and development of the
      School.
      Now I am writing to ask if you would continue your support with a
      further donation for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX>. Many of our programs and scholarships have
      developed beyond expectations due to the donations of our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>. with
      an additional gift, we can continue this fine record.
      Thank you, once again, for your generosity.
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sincerely</ENAMEX>,
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John D. Barlow Dean</ENAMEX>
