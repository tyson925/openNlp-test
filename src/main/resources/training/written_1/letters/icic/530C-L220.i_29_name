      Dear Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Name</ENAMEX>:
      <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Thirty-five</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> is a long time to have been a part of the law school
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">community</ENAMEX>. As a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">'56</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">graduate</ENAMEX>, I have since witnessed many changes in both
      legal education and the law <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>. An obvious change is a physical one
      --the old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Maennerchor Building</ENAMEX> where I (and many of you) attended law
      school no longer exists.
      However, its history has been maintained in the present law school
      building through the display of its stained glass windows and the old oak
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fireplace</ENAMEX>. Its history is also recognized by the Maennerchor
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Society</ENAMEX>--whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> are the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>'s staunchest and most important
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supporters</ENAMEX>. The enclosed brochure provides information on the old law
      school <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Society</ENAMEX>, and the programs supported by private
      funds.
      As an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alumnus</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maennerchor Society</ENAMEX>, my task now is
      to beat the drums for financial contributions of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">at least $1,000</NUMEX> from
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alumni</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>. You know that funding for public higher
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">education</ENAMEX> is declining nationwide. Our <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> appropriation is not now
      -nor has it ever been --sufficient to fund, for example, all of the costs
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">faculty</ENAMEX> research, student programs, scholarships,
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">seminars</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guest speakers</ENAMEX>, and the law <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX>.
      The result is that we must think of the law school, in financial
      terms, as a private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX>. We must recognize that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>'s
      ability to provide a quality legal education is dependent on our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Annual</ENAMEX>
      Fund and endowment.
      These comments, for better or for worse, are not accompanied by
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heartrending</ENAMEX> pictures of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">faculty members</ENAMEX> standing in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bread</ENAMEX> lines nor with
      sap shots of undernourished law <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>. However, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> does have
      specific needs, some quite visible and others somewhat subtle, which are
      not being adequately met by legislative appropriations, student tuition
      and fees. I have also enclosed a brief report on those areas which would
      be helped by your <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> contribution.
      Because of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>'s success, the satisfaction and pride that you
      can take in your law degree continues to be enhanced. Our challenge is to
      maintain the tradition of our past and to become even stronger in the
      future. We cannot accomplish this goal without the financial help of our
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alumni</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>.
      The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maennerchor Society</ENAMEX> brings together <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> who share a desire to
      provide enduring and generous support for the law <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>. I urge you to
      join the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maennerchor Society</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX>.
      In the back of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maennerchor Society</ENAMEX> brochure, you will find a
      pledge card and reply envelope for your <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX> contribution. Your gift to
      the law <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> will be an investment in our continued excellence.
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sincerely</ENAMEX>,
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John M. Holt</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">'56</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Chairman JH/</ENAMEX>ch

      Obviously, if all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alumni</ENAMEX> were to contribute <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1,000</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX>, we would
      have a tremendous story to tell. However, we recognize that gifts at the
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maennerchor Society</ENAMEX> level are not possible for all. If circumstances do
      not permit your participation in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maennerchor Society</ENAMEX>, please do
      contribute at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the levels recognized <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annually</TIMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>:
