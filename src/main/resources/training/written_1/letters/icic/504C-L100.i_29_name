      This is a special year for Herron! Our <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">90th</NUMEX> Birthday celebration began
      in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July</TIMEX> and will continue through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February</TIMEX>. There's still time for you to
      take part by attending the remaining events and by making a gift to
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Herron</ENAMEX> in honor of its tremendous continuous influence on the
      <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indianapolis</ENAMEX> art scene.
      Maintaining that same level of influence is harder and harder due to
      the rising operating cost of a professional art <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>. And, we try to
      augment this on-going effort with special opportunities for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>,
      like the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Visiting Artists Series</ENAMEX>, the latest computer graphic equipment,
      the best <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">faculty</ENAMEX> and the most meaningful art exhibitions. Your donations
      go toward it all.
      Help us continue to offer the finest professional art training to our
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">junior</ENAMEX> and senior high school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> enrolled in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX>
      School and to all those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> in continuing education courses. Your
      support is greatly needed and greatly appreciated.
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sincerely</ENAMEX> yours,
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William J. Voos</ENAMEX>
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dean, Herron School of Art</ENAMEX>
      P.S. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Enclosed</ENAMEX> is a listing of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">90th</NUMEX> exhibitions going on throughout
      the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. Don't miss the opening of the last <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Art</ENAMEX>
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum of Sport</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday, November 5</TIMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5:30-8:00 p.m.</TIMEX> Also, notice
