      The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">holiday season</TIMEX> is the time of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> when we're all busy buying
      gifts, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">baking goodies</ENAMEX>, decorating our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> and making arrangements to be
      with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>. This is the time of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> when we give thanks for
      the warmth and love that surrounds us. And <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this time of year</TIMEX> is an
      occasion to remember those not as fortunate as we are.
      <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pleasant Run</ENAMEX> cares for at-risk <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>. We do this
      through a wide range of programs including <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX>- based, therapeutic
      foster care, group <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> and our treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>. Many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
      are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> of abuse or live in unstable <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX>.
      <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> we are asking you to take <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a few minutes</TIMEX> to consider making a
      contribution to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pleasant Run</ENAMEX> to help the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,500</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children families</ENAMEX> we care
      for. Many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> have no <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX>; no memories of joy from past
      holidays. Others are from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> that are struggling to provide a
      healthy, happy environment but don't have the resources to make it
      possible. Your contribution will make a difference in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>'s life. It
      may help a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> stay together. It can certainly make happy holiday
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">memories</ENAMEX>.
      A gift to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pleasant Run</ENAMEX> means the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> in our care will have
      presents to open. A gift means a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> will have a holiday meal, cooking
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">utensils</ENAMEX> to prepare the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meal</ENAMEX> and dishes to serve it on. Your gift will go
      beyond <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the holiday season</TIMEX>. It can help purchase clothing, school
      supplies, books and educational tools throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX>.
      
      Please take <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a few minutes</TIMEX> to mail a donation to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pleasant</ENAMEX> run. Let our
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> know that you want them to have the same kinds of
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">memories</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the holidays</TIMEX> you will have.
      We wish you and your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> a new year full of joy and love.
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sincerely</ENAMEX>,
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Roth</ENAMEX> Executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX>
