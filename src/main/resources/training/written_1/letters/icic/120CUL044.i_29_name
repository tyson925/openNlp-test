      life education for youth <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1943</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Summer 1996</ENAMEX>
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dear Parent</ENAMEX>:
      Your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> was a recent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">participant</ENAMEX> in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Health</ENAMEX> program at his
      or her <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>. We hope that you will consider a personal gift to help us
      reach as many of our young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> as possible. In these volatile times as
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> are subjected to mounting pressures in the
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>, home and workplace and issues of personal responsibility are too
      many times pushed into the background, our mission is even more critical.
      A national emphasis on controlling teen pregnancies and taking
      responsibility for one's actions is already emerging as a major issue in
      the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> elections. In short, we all have a major stake in promoting
      responsible behavior among our young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Health</ENAMEX>
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Association</ENAMEX> provides, through its own <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX>, age-appropriate,
      abstinence based, in-school programming in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> different <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">areas</ENAMEX>: human
      growth and development; <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STD</ENAMEX> education; and life skills (conflict
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resolution</ENAMEX>, peer pressure, decision-making). Our programs are provided to
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> at a price far below our actual cost. As a result, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60%</NUMEX> of our
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">budget</ENAMEX> comes from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Way of Central Indiana</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>, and
      <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">the remaining 30%</NUMEX> from the generosity of business, our own fundraising
      activities and individual gifts. Thus, your gift to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Health</ENAMEX> is
      vitally important to our success and can accomplish the following:
      *<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$48</NUMEX> will pay for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one hour</TIMEX> of programming in human growth and
      development or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STD</ENAMEX> education for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 50</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>.
      *<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$60</NUMEX> will pay for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> program in the life skills component for
      <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>.
      *<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$156</NUMEX> will pay for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> programs for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> grade level
      *<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$240</NUMEX> will pay for human growth and development programming for an
      entire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 500</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>.
      *<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$500</NUMEX> will pay for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> programs for an entire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> for
      <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">500</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>.
      Your support of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Health Association</ENAMEX> can help us make a real
      difference in the lives of our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>. Thank you for your help.
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sincerely</ENAMEX>,
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nancy Haskell</ENAMEX> Executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX>
      P.S. If each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> on our list contributes <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">just $10</NUMEX>, we would have
      <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$10,000</NUMEX> to start the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996-97 school year</TIMEX>.
