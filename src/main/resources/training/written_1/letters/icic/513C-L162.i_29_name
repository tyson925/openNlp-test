      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dear Dental Hygiene Colleague</ENAMEX>:
      In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fall of 1987</TIMEX> I was fortunate to be named <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">recipients</ENAMEX>
      of an <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">A. Rebekah Fisk Memorial Scholarship</ENAMEX>. If you are one of the many
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> who have supported this scholarship in the past, I want to
      thank you for your help.
      As a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">graduate</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indiana University School of Dentistry</ENAMEX>
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dental Hygiene Program</ENAMEX>, I believe I have received the best professional
      education available. During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> I have been in private practice, I
      have found myself drawing on all aspects of my education.
      The scholarship, named in honor of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>'s first <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of
      dental hygiene was established in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1982</TIMEX>. Since that time, the financial
      burden of a college education has been lessened for many deserving
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>. However, current and future dental hygiene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> need our
      ongoing assistance. Each of us can help replenish the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fisk Scholarship</ENAMEX>
      fund by making a tax-deductible contribution of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$25</NUMEX> or more (check made
      payable to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indiana University Foundation</ENAMEX>).
      Thank you for considering this request. Your generous contribution
      would greatly benefit many of our future <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> as they pursue the
      same high quality professional training that we received at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IU</ENAMEX>.
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sincerely</ENAMEX>,
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dental Hygiene</ENAMEX> Alumna
