      Dear Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Business Owner</ENAMEX>:
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Community</ENAMEX> needs are everyone's business. How a community pulls
      together to help those in need defines that community as a good place to
      live, a good place to raise a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, and a good place to do
      business.
      In our <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX>, there is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partnership</ENAMEX> that pulls together every
      <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> to meet urgent needs, and helps ensure that central <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indiana</ENAMEX>
      continues to be a good place to live, work and do business - the
      partnership between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX> like yours, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Way of Central Indiana</ENAMEX>,
      and its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">82</NUMEX> human service <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>. I am writing to ask you, as
      a business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX>, to invest in our <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX> by contributing to this
      partnership through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Way of Central Indiana</ENAMEX>.
      By investing in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX> through this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partnership</ENAMEX>, you can help
      <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 220,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in central <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indiana</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Way</ENAMEX>
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> are there for everyone--you, your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>, and your
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>. In fact. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Way</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> can help your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> by
      providing services that may not be available elsewhere. such as:
      low-cost daycare, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>'s recreation, scouting, and other youth
      activities, emergency and disaster relief, counseling for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> of
      domestic violence and abuse, screening for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart disease</ENAMEX>, and
      other conditions, and more.

      costs of crime, unemployment, and other social problems.

      costs.
      <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1.00</NUMEX> invested in a job-training program for a person on welfare saves
