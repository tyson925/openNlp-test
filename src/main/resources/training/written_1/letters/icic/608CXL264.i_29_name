      Name Address <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">City, ST Zip</ENAMEX>
      Dear Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">X</ENAMEX>,
      Thank you so much for calling me to ask about corporate partner
      opportunities with our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>. There are many ways to become
      involved with the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Indianapolis Zoo</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White River Gardens</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Corporations</ENAMEX>
      are involved in a wide variety of projects that make a huge impact on our
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">institution</ENAMEX>, including underwriting projects, marketing sponsorships,
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inkind</ENAMEX> donations, volunteer projects, etc. We strive to create good
      matches for our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partners</ENAMEX>, projects that fit the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> goals, themes and
      interests. Enclosed in this packet you will find information on our
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Society</ENAMEX> and a few different partnership options. I hope that you agree
      that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indianapolis Zoological Society</ENAMEX> enhances this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX> and
      helps to make it a safe and happy environment for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to live, work
      and raise <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>.
      The mission of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indianapolis Zoological Society</ENAMEX> is to provide
      recreational learning experiences for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indiana</ENAMEX> through the
      exhibition and presentation of natural environments in a way to foster a
      sense of discovery, stewardship, and the need to preserve the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX>'s
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>. In short, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Society</ENAMEX> is about connecting <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>,
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. The wonderful <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">connections</ENAMEX> formed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each day</TIMEX> are made
      possible through the support of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Society</ENAMEX> operations.
      New in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX> On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 13, 1999</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Indianapolis Zoological Society</ENAMEX>
      introduced a sister<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">-institution</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Indianapolis Zoo</ENAMEX>. This unique Dow
      complex, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White River Gardens</ENAMEX>, is an extraordinary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> that adds a
      beautiful cultural attraction to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indianapolis</ENAMEX>. It also provides the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>,
      state and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> with a unique educational resource for garden design,
      plant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">material</ENAMEX> selection and plant husbandry (especially for those in the
      <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Zone 5</ENAMEX> growing region). As gardening is the number one hobby in the
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White River Gardens</ENAMEX> will further the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Society</ENAMEX>'s mission
      by nourishing the vital connection between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and their natural
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">landscapes</ENAMEX>.
      In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 1998</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indianapolis Zoo</ENAMEX> announced a milestone in elephant
      conservation-the first conception of a female <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">elephant</ENAMEX> by
      artificial insemination. The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22 year-old</TIMEX> virgin female named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kubwa</ENAMEX> was
      confirmed pregnant on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 24, 1998</TIMEX> by transrectal ultrasonography. The
      artificial insemination technique was developed in cooperation with the
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institute for Zoo Biology</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wildlife Research</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>. The
      difficulties of the anatomical structure of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">elephants</ENAMEX> made what is
      considered a common procedure among domestic animals extremely
      problematic. The new technique was performed at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zoo</ENAMEX> over <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Memorial Day</ENAMEX>
      <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekend 1998</TIMEX>. The gestation period for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">elephant</ENAMEX> is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22 months</TIMEX>,
      which makes <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kubwa</ENAMEX>'s expected delivery date in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 2000</TIMEX>. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January</TIMEX>
      <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29,1999</NUMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zoo</ENAMEX> received the exciting news that a second <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">elephant</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX>
      <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">year-old Ivory</ENAMEX>, had also conceived a calf. This calf is expected in
      <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September of2000</TIMEX>. The significance of this wonderful news is that
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> now know that they have developed a technique that is both
      effective and replicable. This is extremely important to the long-term
      survival of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">elephants</ENAMEX> in human care, as well as the wild.
      Connection through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Animals</ENAMEX> You can see <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost 4,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> at the
      <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indianapolis Zoo</ENAMEX>, but what you won't see are any cages. Our Zoo was
      designed using the concept of biomes, which simulate the natural habitats
      in which animals live. Creating natural habitats does more than enhance
      the beauty of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zoo</ENAMEX>. It allows the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> to feel more relaxed and
      encourages their natural behaviors.
      Our keepers help to provide opportunities for increased foraging,
      environmental stimulation and social contact by using a wide array of
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">scents</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX>. Enrichment activities include hiding special
      treats like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">honey</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peanut butter</ENAMEX>, or giving <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> blocks of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX>,
      indestructible balls, or browse (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">leafy</TIMEX> tree <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branches</ENAMEX>) with which to
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interact</ENAMEX>. Understanding an <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX>'s natural behavior increases
      conservation opportunities, particularly captive breeding efforts of
      endangered <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Species Survival</ENAMEX> Plan (SSP) is a cooperative
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population management</ENAMEX> and conservation program for selected <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> in
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">zoos</ENAMEX> and aquariums. By keeping detailed records (stud books), zoo staff
      can make intelligent decisions on how to match individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> to
      avoid inbreeding and maintain a healthy and genetically diverse captive
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. Staff <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Indianapolis Zoo</ENAMEX> coordinate the national
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSP</ENAMEX>'s for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">elephant</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rock iguana</ENAMEX> (cyclura) and the ring-tailed
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lemur</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Indianapolis Zoo</ENAMEX> houses <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> SSP <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> that are
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">endangered</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> that are threatened.
      As mentioned <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX>, research is another important component to the
      preservation of endangered <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Indianapolis Zoo</ENAMEX> makes
      significant contributions with the global impact to a variety of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>.
      Besides the incredible work with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">elephants</ENAMEX>, we also contribute to
      the conservation of rare iguanas. A young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hellshire Hills</ENAMEX> near
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kingston</ENAMEX>, found <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> specimen of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jamaican Iguana</ENAMEX>, thought to be extinct
      unti11990. There are now <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">80</TIMEX> living <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">specimen</ENAMEX> in captivity at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hope Zoo</ENAMEX> in
      <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jamaica</ENAMEX>. Internationally recognized for its successful breeding program
      of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ricord's</ENAMEX> and rhinoceros iguanas, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Indianapolis Zoo</ENAMEX> was one of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">zoos</ENAMEX> selected to help save the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jamaican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">iguana</ENAMEX>. Our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Zoo</ENAMEX> houses a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trio</ENAMEX> of
      these iguanas, and along with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hope Zoo</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> other zoos, are
      developing a breeding program for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Indianapolis Zoo</ENAMEX>
      recently became the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">zoo</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">breed</ENAMEX> successfully the critically
      <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">endangered Grand Cayman</ENAMEX> blue iguana.
      Connecting through <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Plants</ENAMEX> Since the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Indianapolis Zoo</ENAMEX> opened in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX>,
      its botanical collection has been integrated throughout the grounds of
      our <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">64-acre</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>. Our naturalistic approach to displaying <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> and
      <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> together has caught on with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX>, particularly those who are
      looking for a new approach to gardening. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Indianapolis Zoo</ENAMEX>'s botanical
      collection is unique because it is the only habitat botanical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garden</ENAMEX> in
      the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> .This means that our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> are grouped together in displays
      that replicate or duplicate the ecology of the world's major
      environmental zones.
      The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Society</ENAMEX> wanted to continue to enhance the garden experience for
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> in an innovative and exciting way. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 1999</TIMEX> marked the grand
      opening of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zoo</ENAMEX>'s new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White River Gardens</ENAMEX>. This
      stunnngly beautiful <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3.3 -acre</NUMEX> landmark botanical attraction combines the
      best of gardening ideas, <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plant</ENAMEX> information and inspiring landscape
      design. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Visitors</ENAMEX> will have the opportunity to view changing shows in the
      <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hilbert Conservatory</ENAMEX> including: <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Butterflies Are Free, Wizard of Oz</ENAMEX>,
      Toyland, and Flights of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fantasy</ENAMEX>. Over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a half miles</NUMEX> of flowered
      pathways pass through <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> unique theme gardens: a design garden, a shade
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">garden</ENAMEX>, a sun garden, a water <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garden</ENAMEX> and a wedding garden. Our expert
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">horticulturists</ENAMEX> will answer personal garden questions and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guests</ENAMEX> will
      also be able to obtain gardening tips in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dick Crum Resource</ENAMEX>
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center</ENAMEX>.
      Connecting through <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> Over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> are expected to
      tour the grounds of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indianapolis Zoological Society</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>. Being an
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">institution</ENAMEX> that promotes education and learning through the connection
      of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and the natural world around them, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Society</ENAMEX> is actively
      preparing for continued success in the future. Our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX> continues
