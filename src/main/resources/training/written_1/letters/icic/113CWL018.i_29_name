      <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Dear ,</ENAMEX>
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Kids</ENAMEX> today face overwhelming pressures, everything from trouble at
      <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gangs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Youngsters</ENAMEX> often find themselves feeling
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">alienated</ENAMEX> and alone.
      That's where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boys & Girls Clubs</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indianapolis</ENAMEX> come in. We
      reach out to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> -- especially those from disadvantaged neighborhoods
      where the risks are highest. We give them a chance to realize their own
      potential by giving them a place where they can develop a sense of
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">competence</ENAMEX>, of usefulness, a sense of belonging and of influence.
      To accomplish this, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> area <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boys & Girls Clubs of</ENAMEX>
      <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indianapolis</ENAMEX> must be open and available when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> need them, with the
      staff and programs the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> need to reach and grow into responsible and
      caring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX>.
      This costs money. Money for programs, for equipment, and for repairs
      and improvements to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">club facilities</ENAMEX>. Your contribution <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> of
      helped us get where we are <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>. We are counting on you now to help us
      get where we need to be <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX>. Would you please consider a gift of the
      same in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>?
      Please, give generously. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> are depending on you.
      Respectfully,
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">James Campbell</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Board</ENAMEX> Deputy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chief</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indianapolis</ENAMEX>
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Police</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department</ENAMEX>
      A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Way Agency</ENAMEX>
      Please detach and return in the enclosed envelope.
