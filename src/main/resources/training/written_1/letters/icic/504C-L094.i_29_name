      Dear Name,
      Things are bustling at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Herron</ENAMEX> in preparation for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the new school year</TIMEX>.
      Contracts are being signed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">faculty</ENAMEX>, room assignments are being made
      for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX> , everything's being cleaned, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gallery</ENAMEX> is getting
      ready for the opening of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Public Figures</ENAMEX>. We are expecting <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 470</NUMEX>
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> majoring in art and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">another 1,000</NUMEX> who are taking <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX> with us
      but majoring in another area. Then there are the continuing education and
      the alumni sketch <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX>. With all the activity, these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> will
      be used more than ever!
      As you may know, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Assembly</ENAMEX> voted to not fund any capital
      <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">projects</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IUPUI</ENAMEX> campus. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Herron</ENAMEX> project will be deferred to the
      <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX> budget requests, making it necessary for us to remain at the current
      site until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least 1998</TIMEX>. A number of repairs and alterations will have
      to be completed at the present <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> to assure their usability for a
      few <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more years</TIMEX>.
      Therefore, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year's annual</TIMEX> operating campaign for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Herron School</ENAMEX>
      of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Art</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gallery</ENAMEX> is focusing on the need for funds to help maintain the
      <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> and our programs. We are requesting that you consider making an
      increased gift to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Herron</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> in a time of particular need. It will
      go toward the general operating funds of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">School</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gallery</ENAMEX>, as
      you choose.
      We will certainly appreciate any gift you can make. Feel free to call
      me at any time for additional information about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Herron</ENAMEX>. Please include
      the enclosed form with your contribution.
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sincerely</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William J. Voos</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dean</ENAMEX>
