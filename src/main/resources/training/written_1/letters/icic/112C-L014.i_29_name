      <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dear Friend</ENAMEX>:
      This is not newsletter. It is a fund-raising appeal.
      But there's no reason why we shouldn't share good news at the same
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX>, state and local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> are freezing or withdrawing
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">much-needed</ENAMEX> funding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who are truly in need. In spite of
      that, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pleasant Run</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Children's Homes</ENAMEX>, with the help of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">hundreds of</NUMEX>
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">volunteers</ENAMEX> and others who really care, continues to make a significant
      impact on the futures of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> in need of help.
      We all hear about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s increases in neglect, abuse and abandonment
      of those who can't fight back: <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>. Yet few of us hear enough about
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> who live through these adversities and do make the grade.
      The positive side. These are special <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>. They come into a
      <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pleasant Run</ENAMEX> program... whether it's for therapeutic help in their own
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homes</ENAMEX> (which nurtures whole <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>), through foster care <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> or in
      the familial surroundings of our residential <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX>.
      For some, it's a matter of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX>; for others, it's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>.
      They leave <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pleasant Run</ENAMEX>, generally, ready and able to contribute to
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">society</ENAMEX>. We're proud of our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and all that they overcome.
      We are a not-for-profit, multi-service <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>. We wouldn't exist if
      the need weren't there. The numbers of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> who deserve our services
      are rising... as quickly as our programs can grow to serve them.
      Please help us help them. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pleasant Run Children's Homes</ENAMEX>... "where good
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> get better."
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sincerely</ENAMEX>,
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Roth Tom Hirschauer</ENAMEX>
