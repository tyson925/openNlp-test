      <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dear Dr. Name</ENAMEX>:
      As you know, we are in the process of building an endowment fund in
      graduate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">periodontics</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indiana University</ENAMEX> which will honor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Timothy</ENAMEX>
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J. O'Leary</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> played a significant role in our
      school and profession. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Timothy J. O'Leary Periodontal Endowment</ENAMEX>
      Fund will greatly benefit our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">faculty</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> by providing funding
      to support teaching and research in our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">graduate</ENAMEX> periodontics program.
      Your support of this endowment has been greatly appreciated.
      I am pleased to report to you that we have raised <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$87,000</NUMEX> toward our
      initial goal, which is to reach <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$l00,000</NUMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>. In a time when higher
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">education</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">graduate</ENAMEX> programs in particular, are suffering from a lack
      of funding, we are positioning ourselves to remain in a leadership
      position with outstanding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">faculty</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>, and private support from
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alumni</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> of the program.
      As we approach our goal, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">graduate</ENAMEX> of our .program has offered to
      match all new gifts (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">dollar</NUMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">dollar</NUMEX>) until we reach the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$l00,000 mark</NUMEX>.
      To help us take advantage of this generous offer, I'd like to ask you to
      consider <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">an additional</NUMEX> contribution to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Timothy J. O'Leary</ENAMEX>
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Periodontal Endowment Fund</ENAMEX>. This fund is extremely important to us and
      your ongoing participation will be greatly appreciated. You have helped
      us get to this point, and I hope that you'll extend your support. All
      contributions are tax-deductible. I thank you for your consideration of
      this request - it will really make a difference!
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sincerely</ENAMEX>,
