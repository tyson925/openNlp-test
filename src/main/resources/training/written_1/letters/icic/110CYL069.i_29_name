      <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dear Personal Donor:</ENAMEX>
      In the short while since <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Goodwill</ENAMEX> helped him find his job, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert</ENAMEX> has
      learned to thoroughly clean a motel <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 40 minutes</TIMEX>. His job
      objectives call for him to do it in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>.
      He has no time to waste.
      Neither do we. With the help of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> like you, <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Goodwill</ENAMEX> has
      continued to adapt our services to meet the human needs of our changing
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">society</ENAMEX>.
      We don't waste time as we are helping the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX>. And we don't
      waste money. The gift that I am asking you to make will be used to
      continue our mission of helping <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> prepare for, find and keep
      jobs.
      In their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX> review of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s best <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">charities</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News & World Report</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Goodwill</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Standout Good</ENAMEX>
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Guys</ENAMEX>." The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> stated that <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Goodwill</ENAMEX> (as well as the other standouts)
      is "uniquely effective, innovative or valuable."
      While I appreciate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. News & World Report</ENAMEX>'s endorsement, the
      true value of your support is measured by the way <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Goodwill</ENAMEX> takes on
      problems that affect all of us.
      Every time we help someone find a solution to their employment
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">barrier</ENAMEX>, the positive effects radiate throughout our <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX>: The
      business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> welcomes not only another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX>, but a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumer</ENAMEX> with
      increased purchasing power. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Parents</ENAMEX> act as role models of
      self-sufficiency instead of dependency. Tax dollars that would have been
      spent on public assistance are saved.
      You and I know that solutions to difficult problems don't just happen.
      At <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Goodwill</ENAMEX>, it is the hard work of staff and those who benefit from our
      services that produces the kind of inspiring results I see <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX>:
      A <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Goodwill</ENAMEX> staff <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> addresses a group of welfare <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX>: "You
      can earn the money to support yourself and your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>," she says. "You
      can get off welfare. I know you can... I did."
      A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participant</ENAMEX> in a <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Goodwill</ENAMEX> program rushes back from a job interview
      to share the results with his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classmates</ENAMEX> in our desktop publishing
      training program. once his tears have subsided, he confirms what his
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classmates</ENAMEX> have already figured out: he just received a job offer -- his
      <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five years</TIMEX>.
      Addressing a meeting at a neighborhood <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">center</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Goodwill</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> member
      tells the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> how <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Goodwill</ENAMEX> can help them find and keep jobs. On his
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> home, he shares the story with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> at a street <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">corner</ENAMEX>. At the
      next corner he tells <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> more.
      In order to develop job skills, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> with some serious disabilities
      begins working in <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Goodwill</ENAMEX>'s industrial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX>. It takes a long time
      for him to gain the self-confidence to work elsewhere in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX>.
      Eventually, he turns your support into a payoff for all of us. He proudly
      leaves <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Goodwill</ENAMEX> to support himself.
      These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and their successes are real. Just like the respect we've
      earned from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. News & World Report</ENAMEX>. Just like the impact <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Goodwill</ENAMEX>'s
      work has on our <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX>.
      Real work. Real results. A real difference in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>'s lives -- in all
      of our lives.
      The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who can benefit most directly from your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generosity</ENAMEX> have no
      time to waste. Neither do the rest of us who feel the positive results of
      their success. Your support helps provide real solutions.
      Please use the enclosed response card and envelope to give generously
      to <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Goodwill</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>.
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sincerely</ENAMEX>,
