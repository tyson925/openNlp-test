      <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dear Dr. Name</ENAMEX>:
      As a donor to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">School of Dentistry</ENAMEX>, you are making a significant
      investment in dental education in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indiana</ENAMEX>. With the support of people
      like you, the ill <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">School of Dentistry</ENAMEX> has funded scholarships for
      deserving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>, research and professional development opportunities
      for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">faculty</ENAMEX>, and a computer network for the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>. These
      advancements simply would not have been available without contributions
      from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alumni</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>. Your continued investment will
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">enable</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indiana University</ENAMEX> to carry on with many programs that are not
      funded by state appropriations.
      I hope that you have noted the positive changes taking place at our
      dental <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>, many of which have been described in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Alumni Bulletin</ENAMEX>.
      Under the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dean H. William Gilmore</ENAMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> floor of the
      school was completely renovated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX>. As a result, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>-floor
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clinics</ENAMEX> and research <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> are the finest to be found in the
      <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. These new state-of-the-art <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> will enable the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> to
      work "smarter and harder"; relations will be paid for through the
      increased productivity and efficiency that such contemporary,
      well-designed facilities make possible.
      At a time when many dental <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> are closing or cutting back on
      programs, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indiana University</ENAMEX> is investing in and enhancing its own
      future. No finer education is available-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">anywhere</NUMEX>. We can and should be
      proud that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IU School of Dentistry</ENAMEX> is positioned to remain an
      international <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> in these challenging times facing health care.
      The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indiana University School of Dentistry</ENAMEX> is promoting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX> as "The
      <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Year</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Enlightenment</ENAMEX>" in dental education. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> will devote the
      <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> to educating both internal and external <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> about advancements in
      oral health care and how those advancements benefit <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> from around
      the state and elsewhere. I hope that you will see evidence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>'
      s efforts in your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX>.
      Your investment in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IUSD</ENAMEX> as a donor is essential if our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> is to
      remain a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> in dentistry and education. Please take this opportunity
      to renew your investment or even to consider increasing your donation to
      the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Century I</ENAMEX> level. I believe that your support will be returned many
      times over through quality education, which elevates our entire
      profession.
      Thank you for your continued support of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indiana University School of</ENAMEX>
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dentistry</ENAMEX>.
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sincerely</ENAMEX>,
