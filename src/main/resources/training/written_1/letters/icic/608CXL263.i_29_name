      NEW <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ARRIVALS EVERY GIFT MAKES A DIFFERENCE</ENAMEX>!
      It's a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX>! Born <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 6,2000</TIMEX> and weighing in at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">201</NUMEX> pounds. Our
      newest arrival is happy, healthy and progressing beautifully. Her name is
      "Amali" which means hope - and she is certainly a wonderful
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> of the hope that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IZS</ENAMEX> has to further conservation efforts
      for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">elephants</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Zoos</ENAMEX> and in the wild.
      The birth of this calf prompted a primetime television special aired
      on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 12th</TIMEX> and again on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 21st</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:30p</TIMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">m.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">WRTV-6</ENAMEX> produced this
      program filmed on location at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Indianapolis Zoo</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kenya</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX>.
      This special explores the issues facing <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">elephants</ENAMEX> in the wild and
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">captivity</ENAMEX> and highlights a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conservationists</ENAMEX> and their work. The
      program also explores some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">complexities</ENAMEX> and mystery surrounding
      these <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> and why unlocking these mysteries may hold the key to their
      futures in zoos and in the wild.
      However, as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indianapolis Zoological Society</ENAMEX> continues to grow-so
      does its need for financial and service support. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IZS</ENAMEX> is a
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">community</ENAMEX>-supported asset, funded entirely by admission fees,
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">memberships</ENAMEX>, donated contributions and merchandise sales.
      Corporate donations are absolutely vital to the success of this
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">institution</ENAMEX>. Your gift not only helps with the care of animal and plant
      collections and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> expenses of running the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zoo and Gardens</ENAMEX>, but also
      provides the needed funding of special projects like <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">elephant</ENAMEX>
      research and construction of new holding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX>. Your gift and mine
      will help to ensure that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indianapolis Zoological Society</ENAMEX> continues to
      provide excellent programs, activities and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> that contribute to
      the quality of life in this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX>.
      Thank you for your past support of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IZS</ENAMEX>. Your last gift of "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Amt</ENAMEX>" was
      greatly appreciated. We hope you will consider renewing your gift by
      filling out the enclosed brochure pledge card or by sending your
      contribution in the provided return envelope. (You may designate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">African</ENAMEX>
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">elephants</ENAMEX> as your animal choice or choose any <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> on the enclosed
      brochure list.)
      I hope you will consider renewing your <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partnership</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corporate</ENAMEX>
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Partner Program</ENAMEX> in honor of our recent arrival, Amali!
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sincerely</ENAMEX>,
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kimberly Luppino Corporate Relations Manager</ENAMEX>
