      <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dear Friend</ENAMEX>:
      What kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> benefit by your contribution to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pleasant Run</ENAMEX>
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Children</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Homes</ENAMEX>?
      Little ones, like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baby Jessica</ENAMEX>, caught in the struggle between
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">adoptive</ENAMEX> and birth <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>. Older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>, like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tracy</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kerry</ENAMEX>, left
      homeless after a recent murder-suicide in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indianapolis</ENAMEX> claimed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mom</ENAMEX> and
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dad</ENAMEX>. Young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>, like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary T.</ENAMEX>, a jobless <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>, trying
      desperately to keep her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> out of trouble in a crime-ridden
      neighborhood. Real <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>!
      There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> more. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Families</ENAMEX> are being torn apart, and too
      often, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> are the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Kids</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tommie J.</ENAMEX>, made a ward of the
      court because of repeated beatings by an alcoholic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alice</ENAMEX>, sent to
      a group <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> to get help because of severe behavior disorders; and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">John</ENAMEX>
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H.</ENAMEX>, a recovering alcoholic, rebuilding a relationships with his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> so
      they can live together again.
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pleasant Run Children's Homes</ENAMEX> began serving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> nearly 130 years
      <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ago</TIMEX>. Then the task was to help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> who lost <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Civil</ENAMEX>
      War. Today, we serve <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> with a multitude of problems:
      emotional, physical, psychological and sexual abuse. Some come from
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> where, through therapy, there is hope for reunification. For
      others, "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>" are the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counselors</ENAMEX> are housemates at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> homes
      where they live.
      The biggest tragedy is that the problems don't go away; they only
      grow. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pleasant Run</ENAMEX> served <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">346</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">125</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>
      we will serve <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 850</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">340</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>, these figures
      will triple. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> who come to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pleasant Run</ENAMEX> are given
      the opportunity to become happy, loving, and productive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of our
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">society</ENAMEX>. They welcome the chance to belong, to become self- sufficient,
      to regain their self-esteem and confidence. Often it is a long, hard
      struggle, but the results are well worth it.
      For <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pleasant Run</ENAMEX> to continue to serve abused and neglected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
      and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>, we need your support. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Funding</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> are
      shrinking, but the needs grow explosively. Please "help good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> get
      better" by sending us a contribution <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>. Your gift will give <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
      and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> hope for improved tomorrows.
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sincerely</ENAMEX>,
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Roth</ENAMEX>
