      Dear Name:
      You never write. You never call. Just off on your own <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adventure</ENAMEX> with
      never a thought about us. But we're here and doing our best to enhance
      the value of your degree. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IUPUI</ENAMEX> is growing and so is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">English</ENAMEX>
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Department</ENAMEX>. So, we thought you ought to know what we've been doing.
      Much of our energy lately has been devoted to preparing the proposal
      for a master's degree in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>. The proposal is now before the
      Commission for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Higher Education</ENAMEX> and, if they pass it <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this fall</TIMEX>, we should
      be open for business with our new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MA</ENAMEX> program in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Fall Semester, 1993</TIMEX>. Keep
      an eye out for our announcement.
      And we made some extensive changes in the requirements for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">English</ENAMEX>
      major. The new requirements stress closer attention to individual
      learning between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisers</ENAMEX> and emphasize the connections
      among literary study, writing, and linguistics. We still want our
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> to take survey <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare</ENAMEX>, and advanced expository
      writing, but we have a different mechanism for going about making it
      happen. We've also added a number of new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">faculty</ENAMEX> and some of the old
      timers have developed new research and teaching interests.
      And you? What have you been up to? Write and let us know what you are
      doing and how you are faring in the journey of life. From time to time
      we'd like to send out a modest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newsletter</ENAMEX> that keeps you up to date on us
      and on you. You can omit any of the illegal or embarrassing activities if
      you like, but other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">graduates</ENAMEX> will be interested in your news. And we
      will share with you our news.
      We've been looking for ways to build a sense of community among our
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">majors</ENAMEX>, our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">faculty</ENAMEX>, and our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">graduates</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>-types (like us) thrive in
      an environment that fosters dialogue. This is sometimes difficult, if not
      impossible, at a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">campus</ENAMEX> like ours. Yet all of us seek in some ways to
      make it happen.
      <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department</ENAMEX>'s initiatives is to offer support for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">English</ENAMEX>
      majors through the development of scholarship funds. In fact, this is
      such an important issue, every one of the full-time <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">faculty</ENAMEX> and many of
      the adjunct <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">faculty</ENAMEX> make at least one significant gift to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department</ENAMEX>
      <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every year</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Faculty</ENAMEX> can be a pretty serious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> when they believe in
      the rightness of something like this.
      To date, over <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$50,000</NUMEX> has been given to scholarships or other awards
      for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">majors</ENAMEX>, by a wide variety of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX>.
      We now administer <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> prizes for creative writing, a fund for
      bringing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">campus</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> competitive scholarship funds. A
      number of your fellow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alumni</ENAMEX> have expressed an interest in establishing
      an <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English Alumni Scholarship</ENAMEX> Fund to offer tuition support to an <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">major</ENAMEX> who promises to make a contribution to life after graduating. We
      can support such a scholarship if you will give <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$25.00</NUMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">English</ENAMEX>
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alumni Scholarship Fund</ENAMEX>. If every <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">graduate</ENAMEX> takes this opportunity
      to pass along the gifts they have received, then in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few years</TIMEX>, we can
      offer scholarships to a number of worthy undergraduates.
      So, fill out the enclosed form and we'll be delighted to hear from
      you.
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sincerely</ENAMEX> yours,
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard C. Turner Chair</ENAMEX>
      P.S. Please return the completed questionnaire and the enclosed donor
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">card</ENAMEX> in the prepaid, self-addressed envelope. Thank you.
