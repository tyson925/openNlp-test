      Dear Name:
      Please send <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a million dollars</NUMEX> so we can really support geological
      activities here at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IUPUI</ENAMEX> in perpetuity. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Late last Spring</TIMEX>, we established
      an account for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IGGS Scholarship</ENAMEX> to help defray the tuition costs for
      an undergraduate major in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Geology at IUPUI</ENAMEX>. As I explained at that Spring
      meeting, I hoped that, eventually, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IGGS Scholarship</ENAMEX> fund would have a
      principal of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$20,000</NUMEX> so that the interest would cover the complete costs
      for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one year</TIMEX>. The account now has <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $4,400</NUMEX>.
      There are several ways that we can reach the balance of our target
      principal. The simplest is for one or more of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> to simply
      donate <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">one million dollars</NUMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IGGS Scholarship Fund</ENAMEX>. If, because of
      the depressed stock market, your assets are not liquid enough for you to
      come up with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">one million dollars</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX>, then we can consider one of
      the other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alternate</ENAMEX> ways to achieve our goal.
      <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alternate</ENAMEX> is for you, and each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IGGS</ENAMEX> on my
      mailing list, to contribute <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$434</NUMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scholarship Fund</ENAMEX>, and our goal
      will be reached immediately.
      Another alternate way to reach our Scholarship goal is for everyone to
      contribute as much as he or she can <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each year</TIMEX> for the near
      future and, sooner or later, the goal will be attained.
      Let me assure you that we would appreciate receiving <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one million</NUMEX>
      dollars from you. But let me also assure you that we would appreciate
      equally well the contribution you are able to make. Whatever you can
      contribute, you will be helping to support a geology <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> at
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IUPUI</ENAMEX>.
      Your tax-deductible contribution may be sent in the enclosed
      postage-paid envelope with the attached return card. As an <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indiana</ENAMEX>
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">resident</ENAMEX>, your gift qualifies for a special tax credit of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> (up to a
      maximum of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$100</NUMEX> for an individual or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$200</NUMEX> for a joint return). For your
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">convenience</ENAMEX>, I am enclosing a copy of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Form CC-40</ENAMEX>, which should be filed
      with your <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indiana State Income Tax</ENAMEX>.
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sincerely</ENAMEX>,
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arthur Mirsky Chairman</ENAMEX>
