      A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VERY SPECIAL PROJECT FOR STUDENTS</ENAMEX>
      We are delighted that our reunion <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX> are sponsoring this effort
      to upgrade the student <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lounge</ENAMEX>. There are very few <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">places</ENAMEX> for our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>
      to sit while waiting for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX> to start, doing last-minute review of
      notes before exams, or just taking a break for casual conversation with
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classmates</ENAMEX>.
      To remedy this situation we would like to place permanent limestone
      benches on the outdoor <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">patio</ENAMEX> attached to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lounge</ENAMEX>. Most of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX>,
      this patio is filled with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> sitting on inadequate seating. These
      substantial limestone benches will provide our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> with a good place
      to sit while taking a break from their hectic schedules.
      An <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Invitation to Sponsor a Bench</ENAMEX>
      We invite you to sponsor a bench. Your name or other inscription of
      your choice will be engraved on a plaque and. prominently displayed with
      the bench. Bench sponsorships are available for a gift of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2500</NUMEX> or more
      to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">School of Dentistry Class Reunion Challenge</ENAMEX>. All proceeds of this
      project will be used to pay for the benches and additional upgrades for
      the student <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lounge</ENAMEX>.
      Contributions qualify for tax deductions under state and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX>
      guidelines. If you would like to sponsor a bench, please fill out the
