      <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dear Art Friends</ENAMEX>,
      The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Herron School of Art</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gallery</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indiana University</ENAMEX> is
      contemporary art! It's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> with palettes and pots. It's
      conversations about artistic trends. It's a place where creativity
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">abounds</ENAMEX>!
      You can be a part of it all! Join the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Friends of Herron</ENAMEX> and get the
      inside scoop on the local art scene. You'll be the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> to know about
      upcoming exhibitions by nationally, regionally and locally known <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX>.
      You'll have the opportunity to discuss their work over dinner. You'll get
      the chance to visit local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">studios</ENAMEX>. You'll meet our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> who
      are studying to become <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX>'s professional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX>. Perhaps you'll
      choose to purchase their developing works and begin your own collection.
      Or maybe you or one of your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> will want to dive right in and take a
      course in jewelry design, woodworking, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ceramics</ENAMEX>, or painting at a
      discounted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX>'s price.
      However you choose to participate, I know you'll enjoy being a part of
      the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Herron School of Art</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gallery</ENAMEX>. Join <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> by completing the form
