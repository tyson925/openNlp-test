      Dear Mr. and Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Name</ENAMEX>,
      I am writing to thank you for your past gifts to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IUPUI University</ENAMEX>
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Libraries</ENAMEX> and to ask you to renew that support. Let me give you an
      example of why your support is important.
      <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last week</TIMEX> an IUPUI <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> using indexing and abstracting tools in the
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">library</ENAMEX> found references to articles which dealt precisely with the
      subject she had chosen for her term paper. Imagine her dismay when she
      discovered that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> did not own most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX>. Many of the
      articles could be borrowed on <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">inter-</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library loan</ENAMEX> but there was no
      guarantee that they would be here in time for her to complete the
      paper.
      Unfortunately, this is an all too common scenario. It is one the
      Libraries are trying very hard to eliminate, but the rapidly increasing
      price of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">materials</ENAMEX> makes the task difficult. That's why your past
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">generosity</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IUPUI Libraries</ENAMEX> has been so appreciated!
      Your continued involvement is vital. Groundbreaking for the new
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">library</ENAMEX> will be <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this summer</TIMEX>. But this wonderful new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>, with its
      21st <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Century</ENAMEX> computer resources will need the continued involvement of
      many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> like you --<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who understand that a library is more than
      bricks, mortar, and good architecture.
      As you know, a library is a living resource, where the cultural
      history, the scientific discovery, and the philosophical dialogue of a
      planet is gathered for active exploration and study. For the IUPUI
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University Libraries</ENAMEX> to have collections, access, and services which meet
      your expectations requires <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> both inside the
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University</ENAMEX> and throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX>, state and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>.
      With your assistance, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Libraries</ENAMEX> will be able to provide more
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">journals</ENAMEX>, more computerized databases for locating vital information, and
      more equipment for rapid access to the computerized catalog and
      indexes.
      I ask you to join me in renewing your pledge of support to the
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University Libraries</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IUPUI</ENAMEX>, and to consider increasing that
      contribution. At whatever level you may contribute, your gift will make a
      difference to all the present and future <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>, and will
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">foster</ENAMEX> continued excellence at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IUPUI</ENAMEX>.
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sincerely</ENAMEX>,
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howard G. Schaller</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Professor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Emeritus IU School of Business</ENAMEX> Former
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dean of the Faculties</ENAMEX>, IUPUI
      P.S. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IUPUI University Libraries</ENAMEX> belong to you and every <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indiana</ENAMEX>
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizen</ENAMEX>. You can make sure they do their job when you make your gift to
      help them provide the very best in collections and services!
