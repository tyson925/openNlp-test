      <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dear Friend</ENAMEX>:
      In looking back at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX> and forward to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the new millennium</TIMEX>, we can be
      thankful that these are prosperous times for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indiana</ENAMEX>. More <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hoosiers</ENAMEX> are
      working and earning higher incomes than at any time in our history. We
      are creating new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX>, jobs, and housing at a record pace. And our
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">population</ENAMEX> is growing for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX>.
      As our <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> continues to develop, we must work harder to protect
      important natural areas for wildlife and recreation. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hoosier</ENAMEX>
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">motorists</ENAMEX> have been doing just that by purchasing environmental license
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">plates</ENAMEX>.
      <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Nearly 416,000</NUMEX> of the distinctive plates with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eagle</ENAMEX> and sun design
      have been sold or renewed, generating <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $10 million</NUMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>.
      The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indiana General Assembly</ENAMEX> also has played an important part,
      appropriating <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$10 million</NUMEX> for the program.
      The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indiana Heritage Trust</ENAMEX> program has bought and protected more than
      <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20,000 acres</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX>, forests, wildlife, nature preserves and
      recreation. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Three years ago</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heritage Trust</ENAMEX> set aside land for the
      restoration of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Limberlost Swamp</ENAMEX>, near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Geneva</ENAMEX> in eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indiana</ENAMEX>. This
      is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wetland</ENAMEX> celebrated by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gene Stratton-Porter</ENAMEX> in her books, poems and
      photographs. Now, wildlife is returning to the area. Egrets, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ducks</ENAMEX> and
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">geese</ENAMEX> now gather at waterfowl resting ponds in large numbers; and native
      prairie <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">grass</ENAMEX> has been planted to return natural diversity and other
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">wildlife</ENAMEX> to the area.
      The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Limberlost</ENAMEX> is one of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 75</NUMEX> projects in which you have
      invested by purchasing an environmental license plate.
      <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">One year ago</TIMEX>, I asked you to join me in renewing your environmental
      license plate -so our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandchildren</ENAMEX> can see the majesty of a
      bald eagle soaring over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indiana</ENAMEX>'s rural hills and valleys, so we can
      float down a river in a canoe and enjoy the breathtaking scenery, or so
      we can hike through the woods and see wildflowers in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the spring</TIMEX>.
      I ask you to join me again <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> in supporting the program that is
      doing so much to preserve and protect our natural heritage.
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sincerely</ENAMEX>,
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank O'Bannon</ENAMEX>
