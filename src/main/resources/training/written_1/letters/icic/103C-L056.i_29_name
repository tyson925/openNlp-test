  
  
    
      In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1985</TIMEX> a group of courageous pioneering <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> established the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YWCA</ENAMEX> of
      <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indianapolis</ENAMEX> to meet the needs of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX> the tradition
      continues. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WYCA</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indianapolis</ENAMEX> still focuses on, supports, and gives
      empowerment to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>. Empowerment refers to meeting
      the needs of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> so that they can freely exercise the power
      to determine and direct their lives.
      How does the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YWCA</ENAMEX> differ from other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> that provide health,
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fitness</ENAMEX>, social and education services? Our answer to that is, we stay
      focused on our mission of empowerment of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>. Each
      prospective and current program is evaluated on the basis of its support
      of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or more aspects of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>'s needs.
      Please join us as we prepare for and enter into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 21st century</TIMEX>.
