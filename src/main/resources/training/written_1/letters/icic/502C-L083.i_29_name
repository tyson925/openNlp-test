      Dear Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Name</ENAMEX>,
      As the new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dean</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Engineering and Technology</ENAMEX> I am delighted to have
      this opportunity to contact you. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years our school</TIMEX> has grown
      dramatically. The electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, and
      computer technology <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">departments</ENAMEX> are now at the downtown <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">campus</ENAMEX> in our new
      building. This new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Building</ENAMEX> contains state-of-the-art <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">labs</ENAMEX> that give our
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> the hands on training necessary for a good education in
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">engineering</ENAMEX> and technology. These new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> have set the stage for
      growth in our programs. New <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">faculty</ENAMEX> have been hired, and they have
      enhanced our course offerings with new and varied areas of expertise. The
      dedication of the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Science</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Engineering and Technology</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> will
      be held on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November 2</TIMEX>, and we invite you to attend so you can see all of
      the new and exciting changes for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">School of Engineering</ENAMEX> and
      Technology. We are also planning new initiatives. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">This month</TIMEX> we are
      beginning a yearlong strategic planning exercise that will result in a
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">shared</ENAMEX> vision and mission for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">School</ENAMEX> as well as a set of strategies
      for achieving our goals. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Concurrently</ENAMEX>, we are undertaking <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> new
      program initiatives: an undergraduate program in civil engineering with
      an emphasis on the environment; an undergraduate program in industrial
      engineering with a focus on manufacturing; and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">graduate</ENAMEX> programs leading
      to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M.S.</ENAMEX> and the first Ph.D. degrees in medical and biological
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">engineering</ENAMEX>. To build upon our past successes and to launch these new
      initiatives, we need your support. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX>, we will begin our annual
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">telefund</ENAMEX>. I hope that when a student calls you in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next couple of</TIMEX>
      <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX>, you will be willing to make a significant donation to keep up the
      strong support that we have had for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past nine years</TIMEX>. This gift will
      help maintain our educational programs and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">labs</ENAMEX> so <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> will have the
      best training available. Your gift can be directed to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> of
      your choice. It can also be directed toward lab equipment, scholarships
      or where the need is greatest. As always, please feel free to visit our
      campus. Look up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of your favorite <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professors</ENAMEX> and say hello, or come by
      the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dean's Office</ENAMEX>. I would enjoy meeting with you and hearing how the
      School of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Engineering and Technology</ENAMEX> has affected your life.
