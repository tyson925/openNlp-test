      change the world, indeed it's the only thing that ever has." <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Margaret</ENAMEX>

      Dear <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Member</ENAMEX>:
      Day by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX> ... species by <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> ... acre by acre ... the last
      precious natural areas here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indiana</ENAMEX> are increasingly threatened by
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">misuse</ENAMEX>, neglect, and unchecked development. We are losing natural areas
      and habitats at an alarming rate. The simple fact is, unless you and I
      take steps now to protect our <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, future generations will have nothing
      left to save.
      Your partnership with us has made it possible for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">threatened species</ENAMEX> to survive -- and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of precious acres to
      remain natural and beautiful. Thanks to your contributions, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indiana</ENAMEX> is
      still "home sweet home" to thriving wildlife and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> -- and scenic
      landscapes across the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> have been preserved for the enjoyment of
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX> to come. And yet, as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conservancy</ENAMEX>, you know
      that we can't rest on our laurels or relax and feel secure. We can't
      forget the many hard-fought battles it took to get this far in the
      struggle to save natural areas and habitats. But the struggle continues,
      because our remaining natural land won't be around much longer unless we
      work together to save it now.
      When it comes to the misuse and destruction of our natural areas,
      reality is not only harsh, it is deadly. Once they are developed or
      altered, and their fragile <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ecosystems</ENAMEX> are disrupted, we lose them
      forever. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nature Conservancy</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indiana</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter</ENAMEX> follows a clear course
      to protect our <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, and we depend on your contributions to make it
      happen. In return, we promise that:
      We will continue to acquire essential tracts of land that protect our
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">wildlife</ENAMEX> --and manage the preserves we now own or run.
      We will redouble our efforts to work cooperatively with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">landowners</ENAMEX>,
      developing management plans and conservation strategies that preserve the
      natural character and integrity of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">thousands of acres</NUMEX>.
      We will continue to test new ways to control invasive <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> that
      threaten many of our native <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> with extinction.
      Day by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX>, your support as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Conservancy</ENAMEX> becomes more
      and more crucial to the success of our work -- to protect and save
      natural areas that soon may be lost forever. Simply put, your generous
      contributions make all the difference between saving more of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indiana</ENAMEX>'s
      natural areas, or never having another chance to do so.
      You are one of those committed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> that can change the world.
      Help us take action before we lose another acre ...or another species.
      Mail your check <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> (or charge your gift) to help us stop the misuse of
      vulnerable natural land.
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sincerely</ENAMEX>,
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary McConnell</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conservation Programs</ENAMEX>
      P.S. Our work is possible only because of caring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> like you. We
      hope we can count on your continued partnership and your support for our
      programs and work. Thank you for your generosity.
