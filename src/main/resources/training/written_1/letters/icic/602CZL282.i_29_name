      Dear Name:
      Thank you for your membership in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Second Century Society</ENAMEX>. Your
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> in supporting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indianapolis Museum of Art</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMA</ENAMEX>) is helping
      propel the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum</ENAMEX> to the top <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tier</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX>!
      Already the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMA</ENAMEX> has joined the select ranks of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX> with
      major collections of paintings from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>'s celebrated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Edo</TIMEX> period. The
      landmark acquisition in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December</TIMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">75</NUMEX> rare and important hanging scrolls
      and folding screens is evidence of the commitment to build the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMA</ENAMEX>'s
      permanent collection of world art. It continues the momentum of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>
      acquisition of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">101</NUMEX> paintings and prints by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Gauguin</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">School of</ENAMEX>
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pont-Aven</ENAMEX>, and the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX> announcements of the promised gifts of the Glick
      Collection of contemporary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glass</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Clowes Collection</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> works
      by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Old Masters</ENAMEX>.
      Restoration of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oldfields Estate</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum</ENAMEX>'s largest work of art,
      progresses. With the reopening of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Ravine Garden</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 1999</TIMEX>,
      attention has now shifted to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lilly House</ENAMEX>. When finished, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lilly House</ENAMEX>
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interior</ENAMEX> will reflect the quiet grandeur of its <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">1930s</NUMEX> appearance during
      the early era of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Josiah K. Lilly Jr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>'s occupancy.
      Dialogue with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> and other civic and
      community <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> regarding the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMA</ENAMEX>'s development of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Art</ENAMEX> &
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nature Park</ENAMEX> continues. Even now, the potential for different types of art
      that may be exhibited in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Park</ENAMEX>, and the range of educational programs
      and community events that may be offered promise to expand the horizons
      of our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>.
      To build and maintain these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> major art experiences for your
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">enjoyment</ENAMEX> and the enjoyment of all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>, we seek your continued
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">camaraderie</ENAMEX> and financial support. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last year</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">17%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum</ENAMEX>'s
      operating budget came from loyal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX>' contributions. Even with the
      continuing generosity of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum</ENAMEX> has programs and operations
      that go unfunded <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each year</TIMEX>.
