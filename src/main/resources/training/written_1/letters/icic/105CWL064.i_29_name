      join us in an investment opportunity---an investment in our future
      business and community <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX>. Because of your past support, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Girl Scouts</ENAMEX>
      has been able to reach out to more of our future <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX>---our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX>.
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Girl Scouts of Hoosier Capital Council</ENAMEX> has a strong and growing
      membership. We are requesting your continued support to meet the needs of
      our growing membership. Please consider a contribution to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Girl Scout</ENAMEX>
      <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Annual</TIMEX> Campaign.
      The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Girl Scout</ENAMEX> program offers an array of benefits to our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> and
      adult <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Girl Scouts of the U.S.A.</ENAMEX> commissioned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SPEC Associates</ENAMEX>
      (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Program Evaluators</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Consultants, Inc.</ENAMEX>) to conduct a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National</ENAMEX>
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Outcomes Study</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Girl Scout</ENAMEX> program. The results were overwhelmingly
      positive. Its findings include:
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Girl Scouting</ENAMEX> helps girls build <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> personal assets which research
      has shown to be essential for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>'s healthy development and well
      being.
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Girl Scouting</ENAMEX> unites <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX>.
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Girl Scouting</ENAMEX> benefits <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> relationships.
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Girl Scouting</ENAMEX> benefits <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">volunteers</ENAMEX> by developing their leadership
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">skills</ENAMEX> and self-confidence.
      Our ability to provide the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Girl Scout</ENAMEX> program to our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">membership</ENAMEX> and
      reach out to more girls depends on the generosity of a caring community

      build <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>.
