      Dear Name:
      "But I am sure I have always thought of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas time</TIMEX>, when it has
      come round... as a good time: a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>: the only time I know of in the long calendar of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX>, when men
      and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> seem by one consent to open their shut-up hearts freely."
      <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">-A Christmas Carol</ENAMEX>, by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Dickens</ENAMEX>
      As <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoosiers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Midwest region</ENAMEX> enjoy
      the timeless classic of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A Christmas Carol</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRT</ENAMEX>, we give thanks for
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> like you, who value the experience of live professional theatre
      and understand the need to support it with both attendance and
      donations.
      As a former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subscriber</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donor</ENAMEX>/current <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donor</ENAMEX>/current <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subscriber</ENAMEX>, you
      know it takes a good deal of money to bring these stories to you. We
      recoup <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">58%</NUMEX> of that money on ticket sales, leaving <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">32%</NUMEX> to be garnered from
      donations and gifts from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> such as yourself.
