      Dear Ms Name,
      As a former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subscriber</ENAMEX>, you may know that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRT</ENAMEX> has enjoyed a strong
      start to our <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX>. After terrific <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audiences</ENAMEX> appreciated the inspiring
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abe Lincoln</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Illinois</ENAMEX> (including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7,891</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>), we added a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two-week</TIMEX>
      <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">extension</ENAMEX> for the extremely popular Having Our Say on our Upperstage
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">theatre</ENAMEX>. We also just finished producing <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A Christmas Carol</ENAMEX> for the third
      <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">consecutive year</TIMEX>, giving <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> the opportunity to
      celebrate <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the holidays</TIMEX> together. It is your support and our commitment to
      low prices for youth (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$5-$12.50</NUMEX>) that makes that possible.
      So far, we've been very successful in our service to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX>,
      but we need your financial support right now to complete the season with
      the same gusto. Every dollar that you contribute makes a big
      difference.
      It's thrilling to be having such an impact on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX>. It's now
      your opportunity to be a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> in our work. We have been selected again
      <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> to participate in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> special challenge matches: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> with the
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Endowment for the Arts</ENAMEX> (to support our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youth</ENAMEX> programming), who
      will match every contributed <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">dollar up to $50,000</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lilly</ENAMEX>
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Endowment</ENAMEX>, who will match up to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$70,000</NUMEX> of new or increased gifts. This
      is free money that only you can help the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRT</ENAMEX> obtain. Without your help we
      will lose some of this grant money.
      You have heard from us twice by mail <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this season</TIMEX> requesting your
      support. This letter is to let you know that we still need your help to
      continue our record of strong fiscal management, vibrant theatrical
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">productions</ENAMEX> and outstanding educational programs. We have a long way to
      go before we reach our goal of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$319,500</NUMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subscribers</ENAMEX> such
      as yourself. Your gift and the doubling of these dollars through the two
      challenge matches will help us reach this goal.
      Ticket sales and subscriptions cannot finance our complete <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX>.
      Soon, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRT</ENAMEX> will be calling you to take your pledge
      over the phone. We hope you will enjoy talking to them, but if you would
      prefer, you may send your gift in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> by using the enclosed envelope
      and pledge card. Either way, it's important that we hear from you during
      this last fundraising drive of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998-99 season</TIMEX>. Thank you.
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sincerely</ENAMEX>,
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brian Payne Managing Director</ENAMEX>
      P.S. Your contributed support directly benefits the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRT</ENAMEX>'s outreach
      programs. Please give generously.
