      Dear Dr.
      Dream of a world free of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart disease</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">alcoholism</ENAMEX>, and
      <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Alzheimer's</ENAMEX>. Go ahead, dream. No rural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> without <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX>, no
      smoking, no <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> foregoing medical school for lack of funds, no
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> ceasing their inquiries for lack of support.
      As we celebrate the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">90th</NUMEX> birthday of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indiana University School of</ENAMEX>
      Medicine, we realize how much we owe to dreamers and their dreams...
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Lowe Bryan</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IU</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> whose dream of a broadly based
      university led to the founding of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IU School of Medicine</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1903</TIMEX>.
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> and Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert w. Long</ENAMEX>, a hospital designed for teaching and
      research.
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dean Charles Emerson</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IU School of Nursing</ENAMEX>, despite the warning of
      its <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">superintendent</ENAMEX> that the place had "no future."
      The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Whitcomb Riley</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> for teaching,
      research, and care of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>.
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ellnora Krannert</ENAMEX>, a multidisciplinary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> to study heart
      <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>.
      The list of dreamers goes on: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ball</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maxwell</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Coleman</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ritchey, Van</ENAMEX>
      <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nuys</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hickam, Wells, Bowen, Regenstrief, Gatch</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Irwin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beering</ENAMEX>...
      History created our present; we are the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dreamers</ENAMEX> who build the future.
      Remember when cures for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">polio</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">smallpox</ENAMEX> were just dreams? We dream of
      translating the newest miracles of molecular biology, immunology, and
      medical research into education and patient care --for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, the
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Midwest</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>. Here, in the heart of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indiana</ENAMEX>, there is no
      shortage of ideas, energy, and devotion to our dreamers will be
      remembered long after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>. Will you add your dreams to ours? Please
      renew your <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> gift to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indiana University School of Medicine</ENAMEX>, and help
      make dreams come true for generations to come.
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sincerely</ENAMEX>,
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter J. Daly</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">M.D.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dean</ENAMEX>
