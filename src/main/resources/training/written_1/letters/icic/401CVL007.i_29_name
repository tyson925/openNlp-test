      Dear Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Name</ENAMEX>:
      It's exciting to see the revitalization efforts of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greater Fountain</ENAMEX>
      Square get broad recognition, like in the attached newspaper articles.
      Although these advances are encouraging, our work is far from complete. I
      am writing to you as a donor to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SouthEast Neighborhood Development</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEND</ENAMEX>)
      to update you on both our accomplishments and the challenges we are
      tackling next. For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past fifteen years</TIMEX> SEND has been working to
      transform the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southeast Side</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> project at a time. As you know, SEND is
      a neighborhood-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> investing in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greater Fountain Square</ENAMEX>'s
      housing, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youth</ENAMEX>, and economic future. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past eight years</TIMEX> SEND has
      renovated over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX> homes for affordable resale to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>, created more
      than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> high quality <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartments</ENAMEX>, assisted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX> to expand or
      improve their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX>, created <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX>, and taught more than
      <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youth</ENAMEX> work ethics and skills. We have directly invested <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">over $15</NUMEX>
      Million into the neighborhood through these programs, and transformed
      <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of lives.
      The upcoming <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> offers even more exciting opportunities. We are
      currently finalizing plans for the transformation of the old <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">G.C. Murphy</ENAMEX>
      store in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fountain Square</ENAMEX> into retail, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>, and residential space which
      will provide another anchor for the commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">district</ENAMEX>. We have
      implemented a computer training program for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">64</NUMEX> at-risk neighborhood youth
      by partnering with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> other local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>. We are also studying the
      transformation of a blighted <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">warehouse building</ENAMEX> into <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX>' live-work
      <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">loft space</ENAMEX>, which could become a cultural and economic magnet for the
      area. The impact of these projects will be accelerated by an economic
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX> initiative launched <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> which will enable new and
      existing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX> to flourish in this neighborhood.
      SEND advances these efforts by forming long-standing relationships
      with local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX>, and other interested groups
      and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>. Our records indicate that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> you contributed
      <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$100.00</NUMEX> to our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>. We would like to expand our relationship by
      asking that you make a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$200.00</NUMEX> tax-deductible contribution to the work of
      SEND. If such a contribution is not feasible at this time, we would of
      course welcome a renewal of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX>'s commitment.
      Thank you again for your past and future support of community
      development on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Side</ENAMEX>. If you have any questions or suggestions
      for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEND</ENAMEX>'s programs, please do not hesitate to call me.
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sincerely</ENAMEX>,
      
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Taft</ENAMEX> Executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX>
