      Your contribution to <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Goodwill</ENAMEX> will mean more than you may know.
      To help you see how much your contribution means, I'm sharing with you
      The words of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who have lived <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Goodwill</ENAMEX>'s mission. We want you to
      Know why your support of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Goodwill</ENAMEX> is so important.
      Your gift to <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Goodwill</ENAMEX> is important because <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with physical and
      Mental disabilities sometimes need an extra hand to know the pride that
      comes with work.
      "I was sad when I couldn't go to the snack bar to buy a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">soda</ENAMEX>. Now I
      can buy a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">soda</ENAMEX> and spend money. I like working and making money. I have a
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">savings</ENAMEX> account. I can write my name on the deposit slip. If I wasn't
      working here ...I would be sad ..." -- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maureen</ENAMEX>
      Because turning welfare <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX> into tax <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">payers</ENAMEX> just makes
      sense.
      "When I <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> came to <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Goodwill I</ENAMEX> was a single <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> with little or no
      self-esteem. I was on welfare and without my diploma. Coming to <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Goodwill</ENAMEX>
      was the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step toward my becoming totally independent. I am now
      ...totally off of welfare. I really like my job." -- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sherry</ENAMEX>
      Because <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> want to work.
      "I'd never finished high school. I had no experience or skills ... The
      <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only</NUMEX> thing I did know for sure was here's a chance to change things for
      me and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>... I rode a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bike</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Goodwill</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rain</ENAMEX> and snow. I
      wanted to be there ...I had my <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> chance to change my life." --
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donna</ENAMEX>
      Because teaching a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> to fish will keep him fed for his entire
      life.
      "Before I got to <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Goodwill</ENAMEX>, I was on a mission. I just wanted a job. It
      didn't matter what the job was, I just wanted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>. Now, I'm on a journey.
      I've got more than a job; I've got a career. My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">instructor</ENAMEX> played a role
      like no other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">instructor</ENAMEX> I've ever had I appreciate everything that
      Goodwill has done for me." -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cornell</ENAMEX>
      <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Each year</TIMEX>, we help <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who face tremendous obstacles.
      Their <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> common goal: they all want to work. A robust economy helps by
      providing job opportunities, but to be honest, most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who
      aren't working <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> are quite simply the ones who face the greatest
      obstacles.
      The kinds of services we provide help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> deal with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">obstacles</ENAMEX> like
      health care, transportation and child care -problems that are big enough
      on their own without being compounded by factors like physical and mental
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">disabilities</ENAMEX>, illiteracy and lack of job skills.
      <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last year</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Goodwill</ENAMEX> helped <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,300</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> find jobs that increased their
      self-sufficiency. Your gift to <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Goodwill</ENAMEX> will be used directly to support
      services that will help even more find jobs.
      Right now, there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who do not know what it feels
      like to support themselves. You can help them to know that feeling.
      Please help <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Goodwill</ENAMEX> and help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> find jobs. Use the enclosed card
      and give a generous gift to <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Goodwill</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>!
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sincerely</ENAMEX>,
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James M. McClelland President</ENAMEX>
