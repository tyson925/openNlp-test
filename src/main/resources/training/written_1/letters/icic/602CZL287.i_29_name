      Dear Name:
      Please join me in supporting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indianapolis Museum of Art</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>
      <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Annual</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Operating Campaign</ENAMEX>. Your financial investment allows the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> to
      present outstanding special exhibitions, educational programs for
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>, classic films, exciting concerts, horticulture
      study, in-depth lectures, family festivals and so much more.
      We are proud of all that was accomplished in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>, but we still have
      <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$120,000</NUMEX> to raise in order to meet <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year's annual</TIMEX> operating goal and
      to ensure programs and special exhibitions already scheduled for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>.
      Your pledge of support is vital. Only by meeting our financial goals by
      <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 31</TIMEX> can we be sure that necessary repairs, art exhibitions and
      educational programs continue to meet your expectations. If we begin our
      new <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year</TIMEX> with a deficit, this will be a real challenge.
      As we continue our <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year-end</TIMEX> fund raising, we are preparing many events
      for you and your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> to enjoy <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this winter</TIMEX> including our traditional
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">holiday</ENAMEX> musical concerts and family holiday studio activities,
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">storytelling</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>' s gift making. Whether you browse the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMA</ENAMEX> gift
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">shop</ENAMEX> for a unique holiday gift, enjoy lunch with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> at The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Garden</ENAMEX>
      on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Green</ENAMEX>, or introduce a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> or co-worker to the splendor of the
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lilly Pavilion</ENAMEX> bedecked for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the season</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMA</ENAMEX> is a beautiful place for
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">holiday</ENAMEX> entertaining.
      Your support of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Annual Campaign</ENAMEX> makes all that you see
      and do at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMA</ENAMEX> possible. Every gift, regardless of the amount, is
      important as we work toward meeting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>'s goal. Participation from all
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">museum</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> is crucial. I hope you will spend some time at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMA</ENAMEX>
      <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this holiday season</TIMEX>, and thank you for your support of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Annual</ENAMEX>
      Operating Campaign.
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sincerely</ENAMEX>,
