      <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Dear Â«INFSAL1Â»,</ENAMEX>
      As I begin my tenure as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cathedral</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fifth president</ENAMEX>, I would share
      with you how impressed I am by all that this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX> stands for.
      Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1918</TIMEX>, this special <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> has done an extraordinary job of
      preparing our young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> for college, and, more importantly, life. Our
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">graduates</ENAMEX> have left this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> ready to take significant roles in their
      careers, their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX>, their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX>, and, importantly, in their
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>.
      "High expectations" are common at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cathedral</ENAMEX>, and we prepare for the
      <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year 2000</TIMEX> with very high expectations for our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>, our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">faculty</ENAMEX>, our
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">administrators</ENAMEX>, our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX> and all of those who express their
      allegiance to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>.
      We are very aware of the important role financial resources will
      playas we look to the future. We will require the continued financial
      support of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> which share our belief
      that a strong, private, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catholic</ENAMEX> high school education, as offered at
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cathedral</ENAMEX>, will continue to prepare the leaders our society so
      desperately needs. Your support of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Annual Fund</ENAMEX> has been a critical
      piece of the plan to make this educational experience accessible to the
      diverse <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that our mission statement challenges
      us to serve.
      I would like to compliment our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Annual Fund</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike Harrison</ENAMEX>,
      for the outstanding results which were accomplished in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998-1999</TIMEX> (the
      <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year ending June 30, 1999</TIMEX>). Our goal of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$320,000</NUMEX> was surpassed as
      a new record was set with a total of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$365,000</NUMEX>. A special thank you to
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marianne Downey</ENAMEX> for her support of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Annual Fund</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past</TIMEX> as well as
      in her new role as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institutional Advancement</ENAMEX>. We look forward
      to the support that new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Development</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Associate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hilary S. Oberlies</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">'85</NUMEX> will
      provide for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Annual Fund</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX>.
      We cannot take <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cathedral High School</ENAMEX> for granted. It will take the
      very best from all of us to ensure that her future shines as brightly as
      has her past. I call on you to continue your financial support of the
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">institution</ENAMEX> through your gift to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Annual Fund</ENAMEX>. I can assure you that
      your investment in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX> will allow us to continue the long
      tradition of excellence that is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cathedral High School</ENAMEX>.
      Thank you for your support!
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sincerely</ENAMEX>,
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen J. Helmich President</ENAMEX>
