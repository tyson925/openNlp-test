      <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Dear,</ENAMEX>
      Sometime in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX>, you should have received the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Elijah House</ENAMEX> magazine
      <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Healing Hearts, Changing Lives</ENAMEX> with the theme, " <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A New Beginning</ENAMEX>. " My
      hope is you were greatly blessed and encouraged by this issue. We're
      committed to expressing the heart of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lord</ENAMEX> with relevance to the call
      and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ministry</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Elijah House</ENAMEX> in every issue.
      In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past 25</TIMEX> plus years of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ministry</ENAMEX>, a newsletter was sent free of
      charge to anyone who asked to be on our mailing list. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>, the
      newsletter evolved into the magazine you receive <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>. Many have told us
      they view this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> as an important <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ministry</ENAMEX> tool and see it being
      used to draw His <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> closer to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus</ENAMEX>. I would like to see that
      continue.
      However, to continue providing <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Healing Hearts, Changing Lives</ENAMEX> Elijah
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> is asking for a subscription payment of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$J 5</NUMEX> per year to help
      offset publishing and mailing costs. If you would like to offer a gift
      beyond the suggested subscription, just fill in that amount below. We'd
      appreciate any prayerful contribution to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ministry</ENAMEX> of Elijah
      <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">House.</ENAMEX>
      <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Blessings,</ENAMEX>
      <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kristina Wayne</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Managing Editor</ENAMEX>
      P.S. You can help us update our mailing list whether or not you
      subscribe. Simply detach the bottom portion, check the option that
      <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">applies</ENAMEX>, make any changes to your address if needed and send it in the
      enclosed envelope. Thanks for your help!
