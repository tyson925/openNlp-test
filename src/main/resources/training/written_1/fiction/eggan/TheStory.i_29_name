			You sat in the casino <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Snivilling Sibbling</ENAMEX> (sic), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX>
				night cooling your heels in the turbid <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">oasis</ENAMEX> waters flowing under the
				barstools, as the albino bartender washed glasses and practiced flipping
				<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">vodka</ENAMEX> bottles. An evil young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> pacified a colicky <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">toddler</ENAMEX> with wine
				<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">spritzers</ENAMEX> in her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX> bottle. Your revulsion at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX>'s ministrations
				to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>, at her "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">I Love Satan" t-shirt</ENAMEX>, her <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ketchup</ENAMEX>-congealed pommes frites <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Liberte</ENAMEX>--or perhaps it was
				<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">abreaction</ENAMEX> to the bass tones of the hip hop muzak and the screams
				emanating from the serial-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">murderer</ENAMEX> video games--overwhelmed you. You
				pulled the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> into a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stall</ENAMEX> in the powder <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> and urged her to hold
				back on the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX>, trying to explain that she didn't have to revenge
				herself on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX>.
			"What is she but a vessel to be filled, a flesh bubble around <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Lack?</ENAMEX>"
				the vixen asked. "And who am I, her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>?" She continued in

				<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these days</TIMEX>
			"<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Momma</ENAMEX>, I tried,
			Momma, I couldn't stop the tide of tears, just like you I cried,
			The world had lied, had took away our pride, the slow, sad slide
			Of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> that offer light girls a ride, a hookup but never a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bride</ENAMEX>, Momma
			I'd of died.
			But you cared for me, shared bare necessity with me, dissed Felicity
				with me, preyed God above for me, .."
			"Stop, stop," you sobbed. "How can you say that? You're white, for
				<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christ</ENAMEX>'s sake!"
			With a certainty that it's better never to have been born than to be as
				<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hapless</ENAMEX> as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX>, you tied her off and injected her with a killing
				dose of fentanyl. As you left the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX>, the little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">toddler</ENAMEX> was wobbling
				around the coffee table, the nipple of her bottle clenched in her teeth;
				almost no one turned from the video screens to see you on the way out.
			The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baby Thinks</ENAMEX>
			"Where'd <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ana K.</ENAMEX> go?"
			"Is this another one of the learning experiences I am expected to
				undergo--to suffer? I guess the reason <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">babies</ENAMEX> my age have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of
				extra neurons is so we can learn. I suppose that as a neonate I had
				little choice in what happened to me and must have felt breast, warmth,
				wetness, fullness without clear ideas of internal vs. external origins.
				Do I need to repeat <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lacan</ENAMEX> here cf. the symbolic stage w/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Piaget</ENAMEX>'s
				sensorimotor stage of "functional recognition;" e.g., recognition that
				something is "for drinking or "for wetness.."
			[She waddles over to the table and pulls a disposable diaper out of a
				<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Minnie Mouse</ENAMEX> tote bag. Lying on her back on the floor, she pulls off her
				used <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pamper</ENAMEX> and replaces it with the fresh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>.]
			"Oh, the joy of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc ozide</ENAMEX>,!" she burbles "Although I've never seen a
				penis, I expect it's like carrying around a faucet. I've having a time
				finding the muscles to pee as it is. I'm operating the circular reflex:
				an outgoing impulse (e.g., leading to the contraction of a muscle)
				followed not mainly by the satisfaction of
				need, but rather by some incoming sensory impulse (e.g., in the eye,
				<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">urethra</ENAMEX>, etc.)" [Pressing down the self-adhesive flaps, she sits up,
				bottle still in her mouth, and muses.]
			"Now, however, my babyhood seems to require concentrated efforts to
				construct myself, learning to be me seeing, hearing, talking and
				walking. I begin to take pleasure in operating the circular reflex 'to
				produce interesting spectacles<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.3</NUMEX>'
			"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Baby</ENAMEX>-sized mentations of accomplishment, frustration, satisfaction,
				deprivation attach themselves to the sensations and form the bases of my
				<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">love</ENAMEX>, anger, etc. But the way they grow has to mean that what I will
				learn to call emotions are very dense mixtures of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sensation</ENAMEX> and
				interpretation in narrative form: I feel sad because <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> happened. X
				happened because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX> did Z to me or I did Z (to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Y.</ENAMEX>) Someday I will know
				that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noam Chomsky</ENAMEX> says innate human grammar requires subject, verb, and
				usually object--that our human brains are wired to view and thus to talk
				about the world in this way--although not necessarily in this order.
				Here adult <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Freudians</ENAMEX> will be bound to object: 'Baby, you are conflating
				organic brain with functional mind.' I dismiss this as reifying a purely
				mental phenomenon; plus it's too confounding for my developmental stage.
			"Instead I will consider a feeling I have begun to feel now: I am sad.
				An explanation will arise very quickly. I feel sad because (I am sure by
				then I will be able to imagine some causal relationship between my body,
				my bottle, and the disappearance of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ana</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX>). I'm reminded of previous
				times I have felt sad and I will connect them into a series by way of
				the synaptic corridors they pass through. The sad-ness itself will
				already be an explanation of a somatic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sensation</ENAMEX> or mental phenomenon.
				Sensations are on my skin or the virtual skin, emotions are
				already-processed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sensations</ENAMEX> or mental phenomena S/<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">MP</ENAMEX> + (pleasure,
				satisfaction, warmth, i.e. security) = feeling OK. Wet diaper +
				disappeared <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> + <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">insecurity</ENAMEX> = feeling bad
			[She stumbles, the bottle between her hands, held up to release the
				<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last</TIMEX> drops.]
			"I have to say parenthetically that this new stuff in the bottle
				affects the feel of things in a big way.
			"Even now, my feeling OK is associated with events and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>; gotta
				love them (or want them or hate or fear them). These <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> will
				become progressively more elaborate as I accumulate more experience.
				Soon I can say 'I feel I am cold and contemptuous of others because I am
				afraid to experience their rejection of me,' or 'I love him because he
				makes me feel secure and confident and wanted.' The explanations will
				not particularly help in feeling better if one feels 'bad;' conversely,
				trying to feel 'good' will not seem to be enhanced by good explanations.
				I will live through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">therapists</ENAMEX> encouraging me to experience my
				psychic wounds, my feelings, with the idea that I can achieve a state of
				being in which pain can be experienced without debilitating
				consequences.
			"I will ask now, while I have extra synapses, isn't it the narrative
				itself that inscribes the scars on our minds, our hearts, my future
				razor-cut adolescent <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX>. I wonder if it just wouldn't be better to
				skip the pain altogether."
			[She slips, falls on her back, unconscious. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Urine</ENAMEX> spreads in a pool
				toward the frayed electrical cord of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Mickey</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Ghost Town</ENAMEX> slot

			Gazing at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monde de Disney</ENAMEX> parking lot, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">MonaLisa</ENAMEX> sits framed in her

				up over the mass of her moist <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX> and the aluminum sill, cooling in the
				<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">moonlight</ENAMEX>. Her face, the face on which the ends of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">earth</ENAMEX> have come
				and gone, is not pensive, not secretly smiling, but cowed by the
				suffering she has felt and is all too sure to feel again. She has taken
				it on as weight; the excess of everything gradually pulled her pelvis
				out of tilt, her bowels out of line, her womb a little adrift. She has
				just returned, in fact, from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> where she lay under the knife
				for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five hours</TIMEX> while the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> hewed away adhesions, occlusions and
				finally her ovaries and a pear-shaped mass of no longer definable
				fibrous tissue. Hers is the face of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>, drugged out of pain and
				<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sorrow</ENAMEX>, drifting on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Demerol</ENAMEX>. She felt something <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a few hours ago</TIMEX> when she
				came to her full animal consciousness, her autonomic systems in full
				alarm at this latest outrage on her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mona</ENAMEX> believes she has nearly
				fulfilled her aspiration to drama-less calm. "I need to keep my head

			"It's a good thing I already had my <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX>," she reassures herself.

				victimize her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>, they told her. Her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX>'s sun faded in the dark and
				clammy <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific Northwest</ENAMEX> under <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mona</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX>'s minging care. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>,
				now a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">toddler</ENAMEX>, had the better luck of being born in a prison <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>
				and fostered out to a former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nun</ENAMEX> with money and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX> and compassionate
				love. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mona</ENAMEX> is thrilled to have her here on a visit now, just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>,
				unable to imagine inadequacies in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>, pleased with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mona</ENAMEX>, with

				<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX>.
			This, then, is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mona</ENAMEX>, whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> come at great pain. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mona</ENAMEX> was driven
				to sobriety by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> once handed over to her <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX>, then
				taken back (at the teen <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX>'s insistence that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mona</ENAMEX>'s sister was not
				a supportive--i.e. generous--<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX>). Poor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mona</ENAMEX> was then abandoned again
				when her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> returned temporarily to her dank previous <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">home</ENAMEX> where
				she became a gibbering speed freak, an auto <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">thief</ENAMEX>, a fugitive, and
				generally white trash. She and her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> share one trait, an ability to
				recount the episodes when they were maimed and deprived of the halcyon
				life they believe is available to normal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. "While she's here, I
				have to get her head straight, too," thinks <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mona</ENAMEX>, believing for a moment
				that she is in charge of a life, any life.

			<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> starless <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> much like <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">tonight</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lemmy</ENAMEX> stumbled out of the

				he woke, a piece of paper was twisted in his mouth. Dried out, he read
			<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> ask, what is the nature of the revolution that we talk about.
				Who will it be made by, and for, and what are its goals and strategy?
			
			We are within the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">heartland</ENAMEX> of a world-wide monster, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> so rich
				from its world-wide plunder that even the crumbs doled out to the

				in their description of their <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">People's War</ENAMEX> and the centrality of the
				anti-colonial struggle against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> imperialism. At first he exchanged
				tangible letters, paper signs of struggle. These new electronic messages
				are harder to actualize in practice, and the post-socialist world of
				global <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX> far harder to conceptualize in terms of improvement and
				<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">barbarism</ENAMEX>. A while ago, this:
			The deaths of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> ended our military conception of what we

				to remember that we had been turned on to the possibilities of
				revolution by denying the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>, the jobs the death relationships we
				were "educated" for. We went back to how we had begun living with groups
				of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> and fount that this revolution could leave intact the
				enslavement of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> if <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> did not fight to end and change it,
				together . . .And marijuana and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSD</ENAMEX> and little money and awakening to

				Perceiving the onset of hallucination from the soma, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lemmy</ENAMEX> voices an

			I think our human brains are an evolutionary accident. The difference
				between chimp and human brains is very significant in terms of size
				and--over time--has led to marked differences in cognition if not
				perception. The difference does not look like the results of any
				evolutionary pressure. The random gene changes that led to a much larger
				brain do not seem to offer survival advantage commensurate with the
				energy expenditure required to supply it. I conclude that our brain
				began as a genetic mishap, for no more purpose than that apportioned to

				any more or less 'real' or objective. It must take active work to look
				at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>: the reception of minimal sensory input is necessary not

				which datum is to be enriched through concentration. From there the

			Cyril: I say, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vyvyan</ENAMEX>, pass me a gold-tipped cigarette, there's a dear.
				You know, you butch thing, many cosmologists posit different levels of
				universes, hoping thereby to answer questions regarding the seeming

				<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal</ENAMEX>, says contemplating alternate universes could help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX>

			Vyvyan: Oh, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cyril</ENAMEX>, when you talk like this I am aflame! Stroke my
				<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">hyacinth</ENAMEX> hair and tell me ours is the cosmic accident. You may randomly

			Cyril: Oh, don't! . . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dr Alan Guth</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIT</ENAMEX> introduced idea of inflation
				in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1980</TIMEX>. His--the most artistic--universe is getting larger, and going
				faster. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guth</ENAMEX> says the universe is "the ultimate free lunch."
			
			Vyvyan: I love a free lunch, if it costs someone a great deal. Let's
				feast on nightingales' tongues and sip absinthe. I'll call down for more
				music and madder <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX>.
			
			Cyril: Oh, fickler than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Willie Hughes</ENAMEX>! I long for constants like the
				speed of light. Only a narrow range of settings (for these constants) is
				suitable for the evolution of complexity <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">or Life as We Know It</ENAMEX>.
			
			Vyvyan: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Life</ENAMEX> as What? Say it again about the multiverse.
			
			Cyril: I will not. I try continually to avoid repetition.
			
			Vyvyan: What?
			
			Cyril: I try continually . . . Oh! Ashbery!
			
			Vyvyan: Auden! Auden! . . So my dear, despite these deafening drapes,
				is this a lucky universe, or what?
			
			Cyril: In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1974</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dr Brandon Carter</ENAMEX>, a theoretical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicist</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIT</ENAMEX>
				<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">posited</ENAMEX> "the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anthropic Principle</ENAMEX>," asseverating that these coincidences
				were not just luck, but were rather necessary preconditions for us to be
				looking at the universe. After all, we are hardly likely to discover
				laws that are incompatible with our own existence.
			
			Vyvyan: Our mission, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cyril</ENAMEX>: contra the laws
				promulgated by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fundamentalists</ENAMEX>, as in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>.
			
			Cyril: How thrillingly political of you to say so, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vyvyan</ENAMEX> my unicornus.
				<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Freeman Dyson</ENAMEX>, another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicist</ENAMEX>, once said, "The universe in some sense
				must have known we were coming."
			
			Vyvyan: Yep!
			
			Cyril: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dr Steven Weinberg</ENAMEX> is positively <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Miltonic</ENAMEX> in his comments on the
				<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">universe</ENAMEX>, which he sees bubbling progeny like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">buds</ENAMEX>. According to
				string theory, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hogan</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> says, the laws of physics that we
				mortals experience are low-energy, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> dimensional shadows, of sorts, of a
				<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10- or 11-dimensional</NUMEX> universe. cosmological constant.
			Ah, here's a snack; I'm ravenously puckish.. Oh! I thought you ordered
				carpaccio, but this is turnip tartare with nasturtium!
			
			Vyvyan: My own, economise now! And you are looking a trifle
				cosmological yourself.
			
			Cyril: Well, if you say so, my precious little fatty. Now, according to
				astronomical observations, otherwise undetectable energy--"dark
				energy"-- accounts for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about two-thirds</NUMEX> of the mass-energy of the
				universe <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, outweighing matter <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>. But according to modern
				<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">quantum</ENAMEX> physics, empty <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">space</ENAMEX> should be seething with energy that would
				outweigh matter in the universe by far, far more, by a factor of at
				least <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1060</TIMEX>.
			
			Vyvyan: And what to wear in dark energy? So the speeding-up of
				inflation lends more energy than was thought to exist? And the
				cosmological constant,, a formula to account for this discrepancy, must
				be within ranges compatible with us!
			
			Cyril: Just, just so. And, as we know, the logical consequence of this
				is that we "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">queers</ENAMEX>" in our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">indolence</ENAMEX> have seen through the canard of
				vulgar Marxism. We live the principle that production is not the basis

			She reads from her commonplace book, makes a notation in her crabbed
				<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-Cyrillic hand.
			"The productive-man notion of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marx</ENAMEX> 'hallucinates <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>'s predestination
				for the objective transformation of the world (or for the 'production'
				of oneself: <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s generalized humanist theme--it is no longer a
				question of 'being' oneself but of 'producing' oneself, from conscious
				activity to the primitive 'productions' of desire16". <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karen</ENAMEX> dials her message machine to leave this memorandum: "B
				<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">quotes Marx</ENAMEX> for whom <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> 'begin to distinguish themselves from animals
				as soon as they begin to produce their means of subsistenceâ€¦' Remember
				that."
			She asks <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Merle</ENAMEX>, her <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Maltese</ENAMEX>, "Why must <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>'s vocation always be to
				<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">distinguish</ENAMEX> himself from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>? Is <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>'s existence an end for which he
				must find the means?"
			Sliding back the curtain on the sidelight of the door a little, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karen</ENAMEX> B
				critiques the notion of production of subsistence: "it is the
				instrumentalization of nature." She summons up <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marx</ENAMEX>: 'Labor is, in the
				<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> place, a process in which both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> and nature participate, and in
				which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> of his own accord starts, regulates and controls the material
				<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">re</ENAMEX>-actions between himself and nature. He opposes himself to nature as
				<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of her own <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX>, setting in motion <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX> and legs, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> and hands,
				the natural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> of his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>, in order to appropriate nature's
				<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">productions</ENAMEX> in a form adapted to his own wants.'17"
			"How tedious," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karen</ENAMEX> sighs. "Why can't these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> see that labor is not
				the basis of human existence? Even <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marcuse</ENAMEX>, for all his slavering after
				erotic freedom, says labor is grounded 'in an essential excess of human
				existence beyond every possible situation in which it finds itself and
				the world. . . [it] is necessary and eternally 'earlier' than play: it
				is the starting point, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">foundation</ENAMEX> and principle of play insofar as play
				is precisely a breaking off from labor and a recuperation for labor<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.18</NUMEX>' But that is so wrong!"
			Taking her own version of luxury in an <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henri III</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1551-1589</TIMEX>)
				straight-back wooden chair, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karen</ENAMEX> tightens her black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">toque</ENAMEX> and murmurs,
				"<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marx</ENAMEX> doesn't see that in his symbolic exchanges primitive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> (sic)
				does not gauge himself in relation to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nature</ENAMEX>. He is not aware of
				Necessity, a Law that takes effect only with the objectification of
				Nature."
			"<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Primitive 'society</ENAMEX>' does not exist as an instance apart from symbolic
				<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">exchange</ENAMEX>; and this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> never results from an 'excess' of
				production. It is the opposite: to the extent that these terms apply
				here, 'subsistence' and 'economic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX>' are the residue of symbolic
				<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">exchange</ENAMEX>, a remainder.' "
			Impatiently re-telling her jet beads, she thinks, "survival is not a
				principle. We have made it one." She remembers <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX> and her other
				<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lover</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jean Baudrillard</ENAMEX>, saying "For the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">primitives</ENAMEX>, eating, drinking,
				and living are first of all acts that are exchanged: if they are not
				exchanged, they do not occur. It is symbolic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX>, where the
				<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">relation</ENAMEX> (not the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">'social'</ENAMEX>) is tied, and this exchange excludes any
				surplus: anything that cannot be exchanged or symbolically shared would
				break the reciprocity and institute power. Better yet, this exchange
				<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">excludes all 'production</ENAMEX>.'"
			"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Good old Jean</ENAMEX>," she sighs, "stealing from Bataille like that."
			The door chimes. A gorgeous young <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> rings her bell. With highly
				stylized sincerity, long eyelashes down, he tells <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karen</ENAMEX> he is at her
				service. "My name is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ahmed Oedipus Ben Maas</ENAMEX>," he says, "and for me,
				<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'work'</ENAMEX> is something other than laborâ€¦The artisan lives his work as a
				relation of symbolic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX>, abolishing the definition of himself as
				<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'laborer</ENAMEX>' and the object as 'product of his labor.' "
			"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Above all</ENAMEX>," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karen</ENAMEX> adds, lighting <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of her cigarettes in the red gash

			Ferd was not the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX>--he had no more money than it takes to buy a used
				<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toyota</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pickup</ENAMEX>--but he was the big <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cheese</ENAMEX> because he was the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of
				the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PWA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> bubbling on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">lawn</ENAMEX> with precious-- tentative--joy in the
				<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sunshine</ENAMEX>. We all loved <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferd</ENAMEX> then. He was healthy enough to work for our
				benefit <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">16 hours a day</TIMEX>, he was edgy enough to get our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> funded at
				the vanguard of sexual healing as both treatment and prevention
				strategy. Ferd was a little like our figurehead as we breasted the
				waves, our sun <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX> as he ordered the world with and for us, and a
				little like a social <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> who, under his bonhomie, was transparently
				terrified of friendship.
			He slid into the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> next to me and we bobbed up and down smiling and
				<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cruising</ENAMEX>, I trying to assure myself I was still cute and attractive,
				<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ferd</ENAMEX> called upon to concentrate so long on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> that sexual desire
				snuck up on him unbidden--in fact, he would later say, unpermitted in
				his job as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> and animator of our clump of radical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and
				<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX>, since a sexual liaison would reduce his availability to
				"listen, handhold, inspire, cajole, hug, solace" the others he thought
				in his care. That <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> he pulled himself out of the pool with a
				slight turgidity visible in the folds of his floppy yellow trunks and
				smiled as if he expected to be back to bob some more with me.
			He didn't come back soon, not until after I fended off a handsome guy
				with really bad <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AZT</ENAMEX> breath, who I knew wasn't likely to take up with me
				anyway. He was already twice a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">widow</ENAMEX> of wealthier, lonelier <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> who left
				him <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> and money for cosmetic surgery. I had nothing to offer but
				sweaty organs.
			"We're walking next door to look at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aldous Huxley</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferd</ENAMEX> said
				when he came back, smelling of sunblock, lime and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vodka</ENAMEX>. "Want to come
				along?" I did. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Huxley</ENAMEX> property, explained our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX>, was really just
				a crater as a fire had destroyed the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aldous</ENAMEX> wrote and
				took his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSD</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laura</ENAMEX> struggled on alone until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1979</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX>
				Sign was so close that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OOD</ENAMEX> took up most of the view on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> side.
			Ferd started in about his acid trips. He had met <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leary</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Millbrook</ENAMEX>
				once in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">67</TIMEX>, he had done light shows at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Fillmore</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Janis</ENAMEX>, Country
				<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Incredible String Band</ENAMEX> (one of his fey <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">favorites</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sly</ENAMEX> and the
				Family <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stone</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Electric Circus</ENAMEX>. "I wish there was still acid to be
				taken," he said, "now that I'm not scared about blurting out 'I'm gay'
				to some straight <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hippie companion</ENAMEX>."
			"That must have happened <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty years ago</TIMEX>," I replied. "Surely you've
				come to terms with all of that by now. After all, here we are all
				together, having fun, living proof that God doesn't punish the wicked
				with anything more than painful, ugly death and stigmatized suffering."
			"Yes, surely I should feel cheered by your reminder of how good we have
				it," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferd</ENAMEX> said. "But let's don't call each other <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shirley</ENAMEX>. Actually I
				take <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-depressants</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">now</TIMEX>, so I don't bother with scared or unhappy any
				more.
			"I think our consciousness should be altered, early and often." he told
				me, his good eye engaging <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mine</ENAMEX>. "We need to experience being without
				relation to time--escape from a conception of a forward moving series of
				events the most sense-rich of which felt as the present and less rich
				assigned to a recallable but fading past. Further, the brain's capacity
				to take in and re-view sensory input led to the development of neural
				pathways that could access and perceive or experience the occurrence of
				<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">review</ENAMEX> and cogitate on the process itself. Sensory input is reviewed
				through the same neural pathways (or analogous or related or proximate
				ones) that process raw sensory input. It is unclear whether the brain
				always knows the difference between processing the sensory input we
				usually think of as perception of reality and processing the processing
				which, as mirrors can reflect each other, can approach infinity as sense
				<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> become perceptions, become organized ideas, become abstract
				categories and then categories of categories. Given what little is
				understood about the brain, it is not possible to say whether these
				processes are or are not organized in hierarchies. The brain may assign
				more or less attention energy, ranking by importance or immediacy or
				proximity or some other order--or not.
			"The result of all this, I think, is that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> have a brain that
				processes sensory and internal mental phenomena at too many levels, too
				often, too much, with inadequate mechanism to turn the processing off.
				We have brains too good for our own good; we think and abstract feelings
				and memories too much. This ceaseless idling is what we have learned to
				call our feelings, however remote the neural processing may be from
				somatic reactions to events perceived as happening now. Like <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HAL2000</ENAMEX>,
				our brain (and by brain I keep trying to mean all the data processing
				mechanisms from senses to memory to thinking) thinks what it does is
				real. What psychological literature and philosophy have always
				<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">confounded</ENAMEX>--the subject and object and later the divided subject--become
				less compelling as explanation and certainly as a concept to provide a
				comfortable relation to 'external reality.' But the brain is best seen
				as actively seeking, processing and thinking at all levels
				simultaneously: consciousness is a trick of our brains describing us to
				ourselves, stringing processes and events into a self, asserting to us
				that the self of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> is the same <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">any other day</TIMEX>, selecting data
				and memories to substantiate itself."
			"Yeah, you're right," I said. I never thought he was sexy after that.
			<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">10 Reception Desk</ENAMEX>
			
			While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MonaLisa</ENAMEX> recuperates, her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girlfriend</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Novy</ENAMEX> might fill in at the
				front desk. Usually dressed for her main job as <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Conductor on Wild Ride</ENAMEX>
				<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de M. Toad</ENAMEX>, she would be irritable in a pantsuit that barely stretches
				across her chest and chafes her crotch. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Novy</ENAMEX> might be musing about her
				<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lover</ENAMEX> or daydreaming about her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brothers</ENAMEX>. She'd not be impressed by the
				small bald <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> across the counter, signing in as Mobe 68.
			"Will you be needing any special attentions, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mobe</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">68</NUMEX>?"
			"No, just be sure my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> is plugged in to the charger and send up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>
				bottles of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vichy</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>. And put <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ferd</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> next to mine."
			"Very good, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mobe</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">68</NUMEX>. And here are the keys for you and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferd</ENAMEX>."
				She might think to herself that these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> were pop music has-beens from
				<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>; she'd put them in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">smelly suite</ENAMEX> on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX>.
				"Overlooking the pool, nice views."
			As they walk toward the elevator, the organ grinder might come up to
				them and ask, "Aren't you . . .?"
			"Yes, I'm. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mo.</ENAMEX> .
			"Ferd? Remember me from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Being Alive PWA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX>?"
			"Oh yes, I remember . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">um</ENAMEX>. . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill</ENAMEX>, . Aldous Huxley! And of course you
				recognize my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boss</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mo .</ENAMEX> . ."
			"Never mind, just meet me upstairs. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Nice, .</ENAMEX> . .<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill</ENAMEX>?"
			<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">All three</NUMEX> would look at their shoes (one pair of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pradas</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> pairs of
				canvas sneakers) as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mobe</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">68</NUMEX> walks away.
			"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Well</ENAMEX>, that wasn't a bit awkward. So <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill</ENAMEX>, how funny to see you here.
				What are you doing?"
			<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill</ENAMEX> might be feeling a little nonplussed himself, and may already be
				regretting this encounter. In an attempt to make things easier he might
				answer, "I'm rebuilding an organ at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EuroDisney</ENAMEX>, and I'm running pretty
				<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late</TIMEX>. Can we have a drink later and catch up?"
			"Of course, let's call each other. I'm up in what they call the
				<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Presidential Suite</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mo</ENAMEX>' is a great <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> and more a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> than a
				<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">boss</ENAMEX>, really."
			"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Cool</ENAMEX>. Call you tonight." He'd kiss <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferd</ENAMEX> and walk quickly to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Disney</ENAMEX>
				shuttle outside.
			Mobe 68 meanwhile would have gone up, sharing the elevator with an
				middle-aged Black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who looks very familiar.
			"Are you a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">musician</ENAMEX>?"
			"I was, for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a long time</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicago Art Ensemble</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph</ENAMEX> is my name."
			"Wow! <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Jamaal</ENAMEX>, I saw you play in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few years ago</TIMEX>, Your
				<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">chanting</ENAMEX> and clarinet were awesome! With <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leroy Jenkins</ENAMEX> doing incredible
				things on the violin. I'm <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mobe</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">68</NUMEX>."
			"<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thanks</ENAMEX>, young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>. I've heard your music too. Here to do a recording
				<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">gig?</ENAMEX>"
			"No, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>, I have no plans at all. I just travel now."
			At the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX>, an emaciated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> could get on carrying a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Maltese</ENAMEX>
				with rheumy eyes and a bad underbite, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph</ENAMEX> walks off, saying.
				"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Well</ENAMEX>, here's my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX>. Nice to meet you, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mobe</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">68</NUMEX>, but be cool--the past
				is emptiness; 'here and now.'19"
			The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Countess Yousopoff-Blitzen</ENAMEX>, might not be concerned that the
				elevator is going up. She would know that her <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> wait for
				her in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Snivilling Lounge</ENAMEX>. She'd look up, expecting a mirrored
				ceiling, smoothing her throat and lighting a cigarette.
			"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Excuse me</ENAMEX>, I don't think you can smoke in here," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mobe</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">68</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX>.
			"<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Silence</ENAMEX>," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karen</ENAMEX> would croak and jab the down button. "This must be
				your floor. Please get out."
			As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mobe</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">68</NUMEX> turns his key, he could be trying to concentrate on
				<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> compassion and the tasks ahead of him.
			
			<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Foucault's Nephew</ENAMEX>
			Come rain or shine, my custom is to go for a stroll in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Disney</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Idiocy</ENAMEX>
				of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rural Life</ENAMEX> environment every <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about five</NUMEX>. I hold discussions
				with myself on politics, love, taste or philosophy, and let my thoughts
				wander in complete abandon, leaving them free to follow the first wise
				or foolish idea that comes along, like those young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rakes</ENAMEX> we see in the
				<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Repressed Sexuality Land</ENAMEX> who run after a giddy-looking little piece with
				a laughing face, sparkling eye and tip-tilted nose, only to leave him
				for another, accosting them all, but sticking to none.
			If it is too cold or wet I take <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shelter</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> TacoBilious
				<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CafÃ©</ENAMEX> and amuse myself watching <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hustlers</ENAMEX> play <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> Hold-'em. One day
				after dinner there I was, watching a great deal but saying little and
				listening to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as little as</NUMEX> I could, when I was accosted by one of the
				weirdest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> in this Land of ours that has not been sparing of
				them. The notions of good and evil must be strangely muddled in his
				<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX>, for the good qualities nature has given him he displays without
				<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ostentation</ENAMEX>, and the bad ones without shame. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marcel</ENAMEX> is devilishly good
				looking, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">queer bird</ENAMEX>, and has made himself the boon <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">companion</ENAMEX> of every
				<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rich</ENAMEX> party <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> in all of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EuroDisney</ENAMEX>. He comes by it honestly, as he is
				the "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nephew</ENAMEX>" of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">great</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michel Foucault</ENAMEX>.
			He accosts me: "Hello, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philosopher</ENAMEX>. Are your thoughts consoling you
				in these troubling times?"
			I: Not much, but when I have nothing better to do I enjoy watching the
				<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX>.
			HE: Oh, they're not here to be watched. Not at these prices!
				<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Thirty-five</NUMEX> euros <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a quarter</TIMEX>, whew!
			I: And how have you been keeping yourself? I heard you were hooked up
				with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dread</ENAMEX> who runs the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Red Hanky Pavilion</ENAMEX>. No new vice squad
				complications there?
			HE: No, he's turned it into an <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>+ dance floor, and it's writhing with
				e-trash heteroid clothes hangers. Now it's called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Idyll</ENAMEX>.
			I: Don't you welcome the acceptance of our <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">kind</ENAMEX>? Imitation is sincere
				<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">flattery</ENAMEX>?
			HE: If that's acceptance, fuck it. "If we are all part of God," as the
				saintly Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cresswell</ENAMEX> said, "then God must indeed be horrible<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.20</NUMEX>" I can't see anything
				special in being queer anymore. "We're all over!" they keep screaming..
				Yes, yes. We're over. We're passÃ© and boring. Though some clueless
				<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ladies</ENAMEX> continue to sing. "queer planet."
			I: You however, continue pursuing "practices and pleasures<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">?</ENAMEX>" You must
				have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> up the . . .
			HE: Up! Just to play for a brief <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">16-hour</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX>. Ugh, the prep. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marcel</ENAMEX>
				suddenly began to act out his words with the most extraordinary
				<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">postures</ENAMEX>. )
			<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trimming</ENAMEX>, then shaving your balls. I fell in the bathtub <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the other day</TIMEX>.
				I was standing on the edge, trying to see my ass to shave it, when I
				slipped and cracked a disc. Now my hands tingle all the time. Then
				there's the cleaning out. the showershot or worse, the bag. and the
				<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10-day</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20-day</TIMEX> runs. slammers the worst. I finally said to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dread</ENAMEX>
				that he was a sleazy old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fairy</ENAMEX> buying muscles instead of love. He sent
				me to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EuroComfort Inn</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 days</TIMEX> and now I'm on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> again.
				They only let me stay at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Real Desert Hotel</ENAMEX>, and in a mildewed room
				they can't rent, cause my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">uncle</ENAMEX> once endorsed the place.
			I: It's no wonder you are so abandoned, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marcel</ENAMEX> For that matter, doesn't
				crystal just exaggerate our fundamental alone-ness in the world?
			HE: Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philosopher</ENAMEX>, I may be tweaking, but I know my ontology. "It's
				<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">understandable</ENAMEX>, but wrong, the notion that each of us is alone,
				imprisoned within the individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cranium</ENAMEX>, when in fact even the physical
				universe of matter depends on us to exist, and even more desperately the
				sperm and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">egg</ENAMEX> that make us and the genes and social conditions that
				shape each of us. The other is always before us, demanding that we be
				<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">selves</ENAMEX> in response. It's fatuous (no, self-centered and delusional) to
				think we think alone. Our mythologies of lost or fractured selves
				<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gluttonize</ENAMEX>--slobber--over the illusions of sameness and difference, self
				and other."21
			
			I: You know all of this is artifact of language, no? <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Althusser</ENAMEX>?
			HE: I've been interpellated more times than you can count. When I am
				<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interpellated</ENAMEX> then I am clocked, called out, made to answer to hey you,
				but the you I create (in response) has to answer back, has to
				interpellate the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cop</ENAMEX>. I is always a response, not to the mirror, but to
				an other. All the world--<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Disney</ENAMEX> included, is hung up on the fears of
				alienation, disintegration that our dear <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fathers</ENAMEX> lived to feel.
			My own <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">uncle</ENAMEX>! All of this is the tragedy of the last <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Century</TIMEX>. WWI
				<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">frightened Europe</ENAMEX> out of its class complacency and squelched important
				<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">social</ENAMEX> movements. The <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Revolution of 1917</ENAMEX> created a hope, and at least a
				pole of support for liberation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Great Depression</ENAMEX>
				frightened the world into a few <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Keynesian</ENAMEX> reforms, but then <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WWII</ENAMEX> sent
				all our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> to war, let them kill in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> of other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>, and then
				sent them home to individual suburban <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>. None of them knew how to
				be with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, so then came the baby boom. Feeding on
				schedule or feeding on demand, but overfeeding. And the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Cold War</ENAMEX> and the
				Draft to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Viet Nam</ENAMEX>. My own <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> are still lost, tripping in
				the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Algerian</ENAMEX> desert somewhere since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 60s</TIMEX>.
			No wonder <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 60s</TIMEX> were aflame. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Children</ENAMEX> left to crusade against racism,
				war, sexual oppression. Suddenly, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marcel</ENAMEX> shouts, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tim</ENAMEX>, come over here,
				<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>!
			I: Who is this angelic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youth</ENAMEX> with white hair making toward us?
			HE: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Timmy Tilden</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nephew</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Tilden</ENAMEX>, tennis <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">star</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 20s</TIMEX> and
				30s, who was imprisoned twice for sex with teenage <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX>, died in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1953</TIMEX>.
				Poor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>, his only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girlfriend</ENAMEX> said he "felt things so deeply. . I never
				saw him with anybody who could have been his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">confidant</ENAMEX>. How must it be
				like that22<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">?</ENAMEX>"
			I: Can we change our lives?
			HE: I hope so. She said "There must have been so many things deep
				within him that he could never talk about. I suppose he died of a broken
				heart." Anyway, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill</ENAMEX>'s younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> hooked up with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tim</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mom</ENAMEX>--she was
				a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">maid</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tracy Lord</ENAMEX> but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tildens</ENAMEX> ran her out of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philadelphia</ENAMEX> with a

				<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">grand</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nephew</ENAMEX>, was rescued from a homeless <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shelter</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX> and
				brought to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sithole..</ENAMEX> . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tim</ENAMEX>'s exceptional looking, but stay
				away. He's seventeen, falling into bad habits already : an albino black

				<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Liberation Army</ENAMEX> killings of police in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1970s</TIMEX>. He is waking his

			"You are awake now, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herr Siegfried</ENAMEX>," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph</ENAMEX> says calmly.
			"<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ahh</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph</ENAMEX>," he croaks. "I think I understand. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kant</ENAMEX> talks about
				things in the same way as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meister Eckhart</ENAMEX> and means by this term 'thing'
				something that is. But for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kant</ENAMEX>, that which is becomes the object of a
				representing that runs its course in the self-consciousness of the human
				ego. The thing-in-itself means for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kant</ENAMEX>: the object-in-itself. To <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kant</ENAMEX>,
				the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> of the 'in-itself' signifies that the object is an object
				in itself without reference to the human act of representing it, that
				is, without the opposing 'ob-' by which it is <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of all put before
				this representing act. :'Thing -in-itself,' thought in a rigorously
				Kantian way, means an object that is no object for us, because it is
				supposed to stand, stay put, without a possible before; for the human
				<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">representational</ENAMEX> act that encounters it.' It is very materialist,
				despite the awful neologisms."
			<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph straightens Siegfried</ENAMEX>'s sparse white hair and tells him, "The
				<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buddha</ENAMEX> teaches that sense impressions can be understood as relationships
				of conscious being to being. The "categories" of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kant</ENAMEX> only interfere
				with this relationship. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heidegger</ENAMEX> is closer."
			"<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ja</ENAMEX>, yes, I think so." He reads " 'This appropriating mirror-play of
				the simple onefold of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">earth</ENAMEX> and sky, divinities and mortals, we call the
				world. The world presences by worlding. . . ' "
			<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph</ENAMEX> reads further, "'That means: the world's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worlding</ENAMEX> cannot be
				explained by anything else nor can it be fathomed through anything else.
				This impossibility does not lie in the inability of our human thinking
				to explain and fathom n this way. Rather, the inexplicable and
				<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">unfathomable</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> of the world's <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">worlding</ENAMEX> lies in this, that causes
				and grounds remain unsuitable for the world's worlding. ' Herr
				<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Siegfried</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heidegger</ENAMEX> is saying what the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buddha</ENAMEX> says--'As soon as human
				<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cognition</ENAMEX> here calls for an explanation, it fails to transcend the
				<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">world</ENAMEX>'s nature, and falls short of it. The human will to explain just
				does not reach to the simpleness of the simple onefold of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worlding</ENAMEX>'.
				This is pretty good dharma teaching."
			"<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph</ENAMEX> my Black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX>, what can an old <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Communist</ENAMEX> like me do with
				this dharma? Am I just disappointed at the end of all I believed in? Is
				there no revolution to be made, now?"
			"The wheel turns," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph</ENAMEX> says with compassion. He helps his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> to
				the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bathroom</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Siegfried</ENAMEX> hopes to squeeze a few drops through his

			The vitality of living labor
			Confronts the dead power of capitalist command
			I say autonomist theory contrasts the vitality of living labor
			With the dead power of capitalist command
			The working <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> historically assert their power
			to take the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> in their hands.
			
			Intrinsic to the capital-relation
			Is the class struggle of the working class
			Prior to and more dynamic than capitalist restructuring
			Is the class struggle that constitutes the working class
			Think of the demand for an <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">eight-hour</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX>;
			it kicked the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bosses</ENAMEX> in the ass.
			
			Yes, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, productive labor
			Is now that which produces society itself
			Let's use the combination of our productive labor
			To sieze freedom however momentarily and redistribute wealth
			<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Autonomists</ENAMEX> say we can communicate our social inventiveness
			and make the world something else.
			Â 
			The active subject of production
			Is the increasingly undifferentiated working class
			The wellspring of change in production
			Is the self-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">autonomizing</ENAMEX> working class
			Beyond mere <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> are moments of freedom;
			they're real but then they pass.
			
			<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Capital</ENAMEX>'s restructurings "subsume" not only the workplace
			But society as a whole
			I tell you in its processes of globalization
			Reproduction of labor power occupies a crucial but unacknowledged role
			That's why welfare moms are threatening,
			and they had to end the dole
			
			<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guerillas</ENAMEX> moved like <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> in the water
			Threatening to cut off resources and lands
			Oh yeah, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vietnam</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guatemala</ENAMEX> and elsewhere liberation fighters
			Challenged resource allocation in the jungles and the sands
			The fall of communism, sadly,
			demobilized support for progressive guerilla bands.
			
			Global capital then broke down traditional village structures
			Marched <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> off the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">farm</ENAMEX> to town
			<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tragically</ENAMEX>, capital emiseration in favela and shanty
			Is what happens when <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age-old</TIMEX> geography breaks down
			But international mass migrations result in newer combinations,
			where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> can abound.
			
			<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Husbands</ENAMEX> dead, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> are left with "free" choices
			To choose between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child laborers</ENAMEX> or whores
			A prerequisite for capitalist modernization
			Is a landless desperate, anomic labor force
			War, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> and famine,
			threaten to cut off <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> production at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">source</ENAMEX>.
			
			But struggle to create ourselves as subjects
			<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Disrupts</ENAMEX> and tears apart systems of capitalist rule
			Despite regimes of power, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> make themselves subjects
			Sabotaging, rectifying, evading, the intentions of global rule
			Sometimes distorted and mistaken,
			self-creation is quite evident among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youth</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>.
			
			In the north abandoned <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> and ruined communities
			Where privilege is evanescing, no longer so secure
			In the south devastation and dollar-<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a-month</TIMEX> factories
			But then moments of freedom where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>'s relationships are less
				obscure
			Creative combinations of people
			are what the global dominators most fear.
			
			The points where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> can be ruptured
			Affirm labor's fundamental otherness from capital
			Let's put our hands to the points to be ruptured
			And assert that we are sentient like any other <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> and animal
			We'll show the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blairs</ENAMEX> and Cheneys
			that their hierarchies of power can be overturned, not
			just disrupted!

			"I didn't understand, really. I was so moved by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Baldwin</ENAMEX>--the sins

			<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marcel shoves Tim</ENAMEX> forward. He urges <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tim</ENAMEX> into domination postures, and

				<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S/M</ENAMEX> tendencies deep within our unconscious, and so on. I think that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S/M</ENAMEX>
				is much more than that; it's the real creation of new possibilities of
				<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pleasure</ENAMEX>, which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> had no idea about previously. The idea that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S/M</ENAMEX>
				is related to a deep violence, that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S/M</ENAMEX> practice is a way of liberating
				this violence, this aggression, is stupid. . .I think it's a kind of
				creation, a creative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enterprise</ENAMEX>, which has as one of its main features
				what I call the desexualization [<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">i.e</ENAMEX>, the 'degenitalization'] of
				pleasure. The idea that bodily pleasure should always come from sexual
				<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pleasure</ENAMEX>, and the idea that sexual pleasure is the root of all our

			We Might Be Together
			A few of us were together. We had almost-completely lovely times with
				our young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> together ejaculating enough to clear the major toxins
				(leaving what were, after all, only subsidiary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">poisons</ENAMEX> of sexual
				deviation and guilt felt by some who were out of phase with cosmic
				duality of sex vision), , although we went out/in on long and fulfilling
				trips together. We had gone to places so sublime that difference was
				irrelevant--to us at least. We also yearned to be together with the
				racial Other. We could have been together. Then, we would have thought
				we recognized each other together.
			
			The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intellectual Origins</ENAMEX>
			The thought was that repression of natural impulses was a reification
				of the restriction to bare necessities for labor under capitalist
				relations of production. At first we noticed that abundance (not
				necessarily personal abundance, although the post-WWII/<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Cold War</ENAMEX> takeoff
				of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> economy afforded better living for much higher proportions of
				the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>) was not satisfying to us, although it seemed to be
				sufficient for our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> who had suffered serious deprivation during
				the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Depression</ENAMEX> and then horrifying war (our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fathers ignorant men</ENAMEX> thrown
				together in foreign lands to face death with only each other's bodies
				for support--while longing for the comfort of love and habit sent by the
				<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> who became our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> in letters to unknowable islands and
				<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bivouacs</ENAMEX>). Our dads came home, moved into nuclear family <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>, farther
				from their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>, aunts, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">uncles</ENAMEX>, etc than ever before, tried to live
				with rectitude and diligence amid rising prices and elevated standards
				of liveable housekeeping, tried to be <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husbands</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fathers</ENAMEX> to
				uncomprehending <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wives</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>. No wonder so many became alcoholic
				and silent, no wonder so many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> secretly suffocated in those
				single-family <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">units</ENAMEX>.
			<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Children</ENAMEX>'s first exposure was to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spock</ENAMEX>'s kindly strictures to feed
				on schedule, an agonizing commitment for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> who heard their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">babies</ENAMEX>'
				<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cries</ENAMEX> as echoes of their own childish deprivations and wanted to provide
				better for their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">offspring</ENAMEX>. The moms and dads capitulated to a makeshift
				of indulgence and vaccination, hoping for clean, healthy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> who
				read <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dick</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jane</ENAMEX> as if they were true.
			As we <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> of the baby boom grew older we had more free time than
				any previous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> on earth, free time to undergo the tidal waves
				of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">adolescent hormones</ENAMEX> and to read <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Catcher</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rye</ENAMEX> and even On the
				Road in study <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">halls</ENAMEX>, although we also memorized <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Pledges of Allegiance</ENAMEX>,
				<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Declarations of Independence</ENAMEX> and believed them.
			Then televisions began to show us vibrant Black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> singing their
				<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> to jail for "freedom," and revealed a whole other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> that
				wasn't privileged and purposeless. We were electrified by the
				righteousness of their new <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Black</ENAMEX> way and the brutality of the old
				segregationist intransigience.
			We were educated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Bandstand</ENAMEX> to the rigors of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Cold War</ENAMEX>
				<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dating</ENAMEX>, and those of us who couldn't get dates understood that we were
				inadequate. Our salvation came from the post-colonial <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX>, from the
				<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Beatles</ENAMEX> who were able to repackage <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Black American</ENAMEX> music to our
				<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ill</ENAMEX>-formed tastes and make us happy with dancing that did not require
				touching. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Beatles</ENAMEX> neat appearance belied their snotty, grotty
				sarcastic resistance to the parts of life we agreed were uncool. And the
				<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rolling Stones</ENAMEX> were better than greasers, almost evil but <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> so
				they couldn't beat us up.
			So many of us escaped to college. We suddenly found <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> who did not
				think we were inadequate, or at least we shared inadequacy and fumbled
				for relief from restrictions of our behavior. We read and we shared,
				<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Revolver</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Dylan</ENAMEX>, and we began to grow hair, to smoke pot and to
				trip. Trips were dangerous explorations of cosmic reality, and they were
				serious, only occasionally joyous, but so revelatory as to be precious
				signposts of the fulfillment we thought we lacked. In the swirling
				hallucinations we also felt the reality of our own <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX>, sweating,
				breathing, ingesting, eliminating, fucking--thrilling. And yet the world
				was going wrong.

				<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Panisse</ENAMEX>.
			<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> fateful day in the blazing sun, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abra</ENAMEX> was stretching around <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of
				the colossal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stones</ENAMEX> with a tape measure seeking the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nabateans</ENAMEX> idols of
				the sun god <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dushara</ENAMEX>, whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">symbol</ENAMEX> was an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">uncut black stone</ENAMEX>. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Allat</ENAMEX>, the
				great <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother goddess</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arabia</ENAMEX>, was his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> and consort.) All over
				Petra she had opened carved niches containing pillars or large separate
				monoliths representing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dushara</ENAMEX>. She was in front of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX>
				[<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Khazneh</ENAMEX>] when a troop of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bedouins</ENAMEX> came thundering up picturesquely on
				their sleek <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arabian</ENAMEX> steeds. Their muskets firing, the Bedouins
				surrounded <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abra</ENAMEX> and sent her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">native</ENAMEX> helpers scurrying into the dust.
				She, fearing for her life but resolute, rose and turned to face the
				<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX> of swarthy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>. The tallest--sensually dark and handsome--
				<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dismounted</ENAMEX> and came in her direction, seizing her by the hand and
				wrapping his other arm around her waist. A scream was forced from her
				lips as they were pressed against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX> mouth and bulging chest of
				this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> with magnetic dark eyes. In an instant, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abra</ENAMEX> was swept away, a
				captive of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sheikh</ENAMEX>.
			Making from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Petra for the Wadi Arabah</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sheikh</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> had a stiff
				climb down, unloading and loading the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX> and pack mules where the
				trail between rock cliffs was too narrow to let them pass. There at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wadi</ENAMEX>
				Musa, where the rock finally opened, these wild <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">knights</ENAMEX> of the desert
				<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">paused</ENAMEX> and pitched their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tents</ENAMEX>, while the erotic dancing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> undulated
				<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rhythmically</ENAMEX>. As they cooled their palates and ate their dates, the
				<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sheikh</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> knew they could not be followed, as they were the masters
				of their desert domain.
			An international incident ensued; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Protectorate</ENAMEX> was forced
				to divert a key <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jerusalem</ENAMEX> to search for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abra</ENAMEX>, thereby
				leaving the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">King David Hotel</ENAMEX> unprotected. But that first <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>, Abra
				faced her captor alone on the moonlit desert. She was carried into his
				<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tent</ENAMEX> and bathed by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">maidens</ENAMEX> who scented her hair with jasmine, then
				draped her in rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">silks</ENAMEX>. She was thrown onto a divan covered in
				priceless rugs, right into the arms of the young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sheikh</ENAMEX>, now abluted and
				smelling of powerful, sweet musk--although there was also an
				intoxicating aroma of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horse</ENAMEX> and sweat lingering at his thighs.
			Still determined not to collapse in fear, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Abra</ENAMEX> sat up and said in
				archaic <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Arabic</ENAMEX>, "Honorable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX>, please treat this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guest</ENAMEX> with the
				courtesies traditionally vouchsafed to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">strangers</ENAMEX>."
			His eyes widening, a smile brightening his sensual lips, the Sheik
				answered her in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Oxbridge English</ENAMEX>, "You will be treated better than if
				you were a mere <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stranger</ENAMEX>. Remember how receptive to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">strangers</ENAMEX> they were
				at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sodom</ENAMEX>, which lies buried only a few <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">leagues</ENAMEX> from here. Now I will
				have a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">kiss</ENAMEX>!"
			Abra, feeling it was more strategic not to resist too much, tried to
				turn away, but his exotic honeyed tongue darted between her lips before
				she was prepared. "Ohhh, please," she moaned. "Be gentle."
			The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sheikh</ENAMEX> emitted a low musical laugh and replied, "I am always gentle
				and always savage. In this case, however, since you are an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> of
				international petroleum prospectors, you do not deserve much gentleness
				in this our desert land." He pulled her roughly toward him and, grasping
				her wrists, extended her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> across the soft rugs and lay atop her.
			"I am a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientist</ENAMEX> and a virtuous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abra</ENAMEX> cried in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Natabean</ENAMEX>, but
				her cries went unheeded as the moon and its caravan of stars crossed the
				blue desert.
			". . . ."
			Less than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year later</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sheikh</ENAMEX> proudly held up Achmed ben
				Maslow-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sheikh</ENAMEX>, his beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX>, and named him his heir, commanding all
				the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tribes</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bedouins</ENAMEX> to swear fealty and loyalty to him forever. As
				they swore their oaths, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> shot her violator, the father
				of her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>, through the heart and was consequently set upon and
				butchered by the loyal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bedouins</ENAMEX>. Achmed, however, grew to manhood,
				(shortening his name to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ben Maas</ENAMEX>), went to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxford</ENAMEX> like his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>, and
				--hurrying along this story-- became the chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">accountant</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phillips</ENAMEX>
				Petroleum. He married the delicate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> of a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tycoon</ENAMEX> and they
				had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sons</ENAMEX> and--the deglet noor of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">eye</ENAMEX>--a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oedipa</ENAMEX>.
			Raised in historic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baghdad</ENAMEX>, the urban center of the most sophisticated
				<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Islamic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> in the world, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oedipa</ENAMEX> outdistanced her girlfriends, and
				especially her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brothers</ENAMEX>, in all games and in learning. Particularly fond
				of riding and polo, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oedipa</ENAMEX> was furious when at thirteen she was no
				longer permitted on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX>. She grew rebellious, flirted with the
				Baathists but left them quickly, and was soon the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> of the
				transnational smarty set of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX>-rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sons</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughters</ENAMEX> who outraged
				their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> with their sexual license and intellectual probing. Oedipa
				smouldered, knowing she must achieve self-actualization.
			At fifteen, after an incident at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iraq Desert Country Day School</ENAMEX>
				where she was nearly violated by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US Army</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Baptist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chaplain</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oedipa</ENAMEX> ran
				away to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jerusalem</ENAMEX> and became a dedicated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">revolutionary</ENAMEX>, had brief and
				fiery affairs with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward Said</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leila Khaled</ENAMEX>, escaped to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>,
				and joined the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wymmyn's Fyre Brygade</ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-imperialist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">collective</ENAMEX> in
				<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Encino</ENAMEX>. It was from there she helped <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tania</ENAMEX> to run from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bullets</ENAMEX>, and
				where she began her Transition, taking testosterone and pumping iron,
				surgically molding breasts into hard pecs. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age thirty</TIMEX>, he was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Achmed</ENAMEX>,
				an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-imperialist</ENAMEX> like his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandfather</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Marxist Muslim</ENAMEX>, fighting
				global capitalism and sexual oppression around the world. Hated by
				<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fundamentalists</ENAMEX>, feared by global <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">capitalists</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Achmed</ENAMEX> worked in
				clandestinity, supporting himself as a sex <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">male</ENAMEX> or female, as
				the revolutionary situation demanded.
			
			
			
			<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Petra</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Petroleum</ENAMEX>
			<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Petra</ENAMEX> sat at the crossroad of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> major ancient routes, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">King</ENAMEX>'s
				Highway and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Incense Route</ENAMEX>. It was these routes which were fought
				over so violently between <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Solomon</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Edomites</ENAMEX>. The wealth gained in
				their control was fantastic, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witness</ENAMEX> the stories told of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Solomon</ENAMEX>'s
				<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX>, etc. Its first written history is found in the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Hebrew Bible</ENAMEX>; for
				the land about it was <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mount Seir</ENAMEX> of old (now <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Esh Sera</ENAMEX>), home of the
				Horites, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cave dwellers</ENAMEX> whose progenitor was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hori</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandson</ENAMEX> of Seir
				(Gen.<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">36:20</TIMEX>). These <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Horites</ENAMEX> are first mentioned at the time of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abraham</ENAMEX> in
				connection with the subjugation of the land by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chedorlaomer</ENAMEX>. King
				Amaziah of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judah</ENAMEX> made war against the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seir</ENAMEX> and took Selah
				(Petra? see argument above), smiting <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten thousand</NUMEX>. "And other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX>
				<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">thousand</ENAMEX> left alive did the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judah</ENAMEX> carry away captive, and
				brought them unto the top of the rock, and cast them down from the top
				of the rock, that they all were broken in pieces" (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2Chron</TIMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">25: 12</TIMEX>).
				Could this "top of the rock" have been <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Umm el Biyara</ENAMEX>? The debate
				continue to rage.
			We know that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Crusader</ENAMEX> King <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baldwin</ENAMEX> I constructed at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Petra</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX>
				called <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Selah, the Bible</ENAMEX> name for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Petra</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2Ki.14</NUMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">7</ENAMEX>). He was following the
				old idea of controlling and taking toll from the caravan routes, money
				being his prime objective in the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Crusade</ENAMEX>. Though <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Crusaders</ENAMEX> constructed a
				<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">fort</ENAMEX> there in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 12th century</TIMEX>, they soon withdrew, leaving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Petra</ENAMEX> to the
				local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> died out of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>'s memory, and the nomads used it
				as a hideout, living in the nearby caves, for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a thousand years</TIMEX>.

			"A beautiful <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX>," says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sithole</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cyril</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vyvyan</ENAMEX>, stuffing a
				newspaper behind his back. He calls them over to introduce a young man
				in an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International</ENAMEX> Male pool lounging <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outfit</ENAMEX>.
			"Mr <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Burst</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lord</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Throbbing</ENAMEX>, this is Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tilden</ENAMEX>; he's learning

			"<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quelle</ENAMEX> convenance," flutes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cyril</ENAMEX>.
			"<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Handsome Timmy</ENAMEX>," fifes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vyvyan</ENAMEX> as the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> toward the pool.
			"Have a pleasant day, milords," says the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Manager oilily</ENAMEX>, shoving Timmy
				after them.
			Cyril oboes, "Down at the far end, away from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Casino</ENAMEX>. It's quieter."
			Baring their leathery skin to the sun, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cyril</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vyvyan</ENAMEX> settle on
				chaises longues, inviting <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tim Tilden</ENAMEX> to join them. He sits between them
				on a towel and pulls off his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shirt</ENAMEX>, revealing a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hellenic</ENAMEX> marble chest
				<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">upholstered</ENAMEX> in white <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wool</ENAMEX>.
			"How are you <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gentlemen</ENAMEX> enjoying <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX>? What brings you to this
				<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">godforsaken shack?</ENAMEX>" He picks thoughtlessly at a scab on his nipple.
			<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vyvyan</ENAMEX> replies, "Oh, it's too cold down in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Namibia</ENAMEX> where we live. And
				we're always traveling anyway--it's our work. And you? Aren't you
				<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>?
			"<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African American</ENAMEX>," says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tim</ENAMEX>. "I've lived here since I was twelve years
				<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">old</ENAMEX>. See, Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sithole</ENAMEX> brought me here from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX> 'cause I was an
				<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">orphan</ENAMEX>. My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mom</ENAMEX> was in the movies and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">great-great uncle</ENAMEX> was almost
				<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX>; he won the popular vote in the highly-disputed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tilden-Hayes</ENAMEX>
				election of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1877</TIMEX>. He was defeated in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> by radical
				reconstructionists, which was a good thing. I'm going to study film this
				<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>."
			"Oh, everyone will be so proud of you, young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>,' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vyvyan</ENAMEX> tells him.
				Just then, a stricken <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">policewoman</ENAMEX> rushes by carrying a scorched baby
				with a bottle clenched in its mouth.
			"Oh, the poor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>!" <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gushes Cyril</ENAMEX>. "I must see what I can do." Pulling
				on his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shirt</ENAMEX>, he dashes toward the front of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX>.
			"<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cyril</ENAMEX> has such a generous heart," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vyvyan</ENAMEX> sighs lovingly. "God knows
				he's kept me all these <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>. And I was an orphan too, from the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Blitz</ENAMEX>!"
			"You were? I guess he can afford it."
			Vyvyan gaily retorts, "Oh, we live on nothing--eat like <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> old <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX>.
				<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cyril</ENAMEX> got fantastically rich selling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gentlemen</ENAMEX>'s jimmys--<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX>, you know.
				But all the money--<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">750 million</NUMEX> pounds--went into the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Burst</ENAMEX>-Throbbing

				<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East</ENAMEX>."
			"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Another Disney operation?</ENAMEX>" <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tim sneeringly</ENAMEX> asks.
			"Oh no, dear, we're not <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Disney</ENAMEX> at all. We're the anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Disney</ENAMEX>. . A

			"<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Uh</ENAMEX>, thanks. I need it."
			
			As <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vyvyan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lubricates</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tim</ENAMEX>'s alabaster muscles, he exclaims, "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">What</ENAMEX>
				entrancing eyes! You have eyes like a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Siberian Husky</ENAMEX>; underneath the red

			"Yeah, I guess it's the albinism."
			Cyril bustles back to say "My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stars</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vyv</ENAMEX>. That <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX> was nearly
				<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electrocuted</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Casino</ENAMEX>. They're searching for its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> now."
			"Oh <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cyril</ENAMEX>, you're very flushed. Sit under the shade. Here, take a
				<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">valium</ENAMEX> and calm down."
			"Um, can I have one too?" asks <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tim</ENAMEX> as winningly as he can. "Maybe you
				<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> would like to relax <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">upstairs</ENAMEX> with a massage? I'd better get out of

			"Speak up, dear <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX>--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cyril</ENAMEX> and I are both deaf as posts. . . Ohh, no

			<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mobe</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Old Boys: A Whiter Shade of Pale</ENAMEX>
			"Hello <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Uncle Vyvyan</ENAMEX>," said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mobe</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">68</NUMEX>. "You look beautiful in the sun."
			"Oh, you dear <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX>! Sit here beside me. Ferdie, you sit there next to

			" <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hi</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cyril</ENAMEX>. How are you, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">love?</ENAMEX>" asked <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mobe</ENAMEX>, kissing his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">uncles</ENAMEX> on both
				<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cheeks</ENAMEX>. "I'm so happy to be here and not in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ubud</ENAMEX>. We got out just before

			"What are you reading, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Ferdie dear?</ENAMEX>" <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cyril</ENAMEX> asked him. "Would you boys

			"Ugh! Please don't tell her I'm here yet, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cyril</ENAMEX>. I can't take another

			"That's right, love. And we need <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a few minutes</TIMEX> tete a tete with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mobe</ENAMEX>.

			As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferd</ENAMEX> walked away, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cyril</ENAMEX> bent nearer his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nephew</ENAMEX> to say, "We have two

			"But in this case we will, dear. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> has a reputation for being

				<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">society</ENAMEX>," Vyvyan shudders. "Apparently, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> said, 'We are

				be an abstraction, in which it is conceptually separated from its

				that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> has need for tovil--exorcism of

				<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">possession</ENAMEX>, gaze, etc. -- they have to leave them once propitiatory
				offerings of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX>, drink, etc., are made to them. Even the mere mention
				of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buddha</ENAMEX>'s virtues is enough to frighten them. Moreover, the chief

				<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buddha</ENAMEX>. The ordinary yakkhas that trouble human
				<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">beings</ENAMEX> have to obey his commands. Thus, in all rituals connected with

				the orders of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">exorcist</ENAMEX>. And in the rich folklore that deals with tovil, there are many anecdotes that connect every

				and go directly to the paritta, the offering of

			He summons a full assembly of the deities. Then, he barks out orders to
				the evil spirit to say his name.
			"I am the devil in the details," is heard coming from the blue lips of

			The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">compassionate Dog tenderly</ENAMEX> licks the burned face of the baby and

				and you should therefore leave the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> in deference to the Sangha

			This is the dangerous point, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Merle</ENAMEX> knows well. If the spirit still

			<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Panting</ENAMEX> in concentration, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merle</ENAMEX> invokes the second-highest spirit of

			<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Timmy</ENAMEX> turns toward the imagined <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewers</ENAMEX> and implores us, utilizing a

			<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Dear P___</ENAMEX>,
			I enjoyed reading your book, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50which</TIMEX> provoked many
				thoughts for me. If I can now remember them, I will try to write some
				down.
			
				
					Our brains seem to work through chemical and electrical circuits
						that first register bodily impressions--whether presented from
						outside through the senses or internally from nerves monitoring the
						body or nerves monitoring the thought processes and memory. The mind
						develops as a consciousness that our brain/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> is actively involved
						in the process of processing. The mind is somehow tricked into
						believing that it is continuous and identical to itself, despite the
						ocurrence of different sense impressions and different sentient
						responses at each moment of our lives. We seem to want to believe we
						are the same from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX>; hence, the creation of a "self" as a
						vessel of continuity, of identity. Of course this "self" is
						inflected by genetic and cultural factors: a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">21st C US</NUMEX> gay white
						male self is not just biological, but historical.
				
				
					This "self" comes to dominate our reception of input and processing
						of reactions--feelings and thoughts. There is some speculation that
						because <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> are subjected to much more biological change on a
						periodic basis, they have less investment in the rigid maintenance
						of a continuous self-identical "self." In any case, most of Western
						history explains things on the basis of continuities, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> or
						<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">social</ENAMEX>, and the interruptions to continuity.
				
				
					Our "self" tries to hold things together in the midst of ongoing
						chaos by assuming continuities and asserting it can and must
						integrate different responses to similar and even wildly divergent
						processes that happen to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> and the mind. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the ways it
						asserts this attempted integration is to believe the individual
						thoughts that pass through our minds (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> concerned with
						thoughts and consciousness say a thought passes through in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">around 20</TIMEX>
						<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">seconds</TIMEX>, and that a new one occurs at least as often) are connected
						to each other, although they are not--in fact--connected by anything
						except the assertion of their connectedness.
				
				
					I take from this the conclusion that a desire to integrate
						different impressions, feelings, or impulses into a self is based on
						an illusory belief that it is even possible, and therefore that the
						attempt to integrate is always a failure. That failure results in a
						feeling of inadequacy that is the genetic consequence of the fact
						that our brains are too sophisticated for our own good. An
						individual human feels inadequacy (basic shame) not because he/she
						isn't as good as others, but because no human is capable of
						integrating what is not integrate-able.
				
				
					Nor is any human capable of reconciling autonomy vs doubt of her
						<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">capabilities</ENAMEX>, love vs hate, like vs dislike, or any other thing we
						see as dichotomous, bifurcated, opposite--because binaries are also
						inadequate to contain the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> variability of situations and lead
						to rigid distinctions about what is inside and what is outside, what
						is good and what is bad, what is functional and what is
						<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dysfunctional</ENAMEX>.
				
				
					Human society functions through the confusion of our connections
						and disconnections with others and ourselves, pretending we are
						individual identities and creating power <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> that pervade every
						distinction.
				
				
					<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sexuality</ENAMEX> is one of the confusing connections/disconnections that
						is infused with power and powerlessness, and is--like all other
						processes--actually not composed of self and other, in and out, good
						and bad, creative and destructive, because these binaries are
						inadequate but just about as far as our brains can go with the
						delusions of continuity and self-identity.
				
				
					<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">20th-21st C</ENAMEX> gay <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> inherit <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> culture and struggle
						with it, burdened like all other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>, with the delusion that it
						is possible to integrate impossibly divergent feelings, impressions,
						<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">impulses</ENAMEX>, into a coherent "self." Since we can't, we feel shame.
						Others feel shame too, but our shame is inscribed with the
						<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dichotomies</ENAMEX> and hierarchies of masculine power in our own particular
						gay male way, as constructed by the social processes (gender, class,
						<ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">race</ENAMEX>, geographic accident) of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last several centuries</TIMEX>.
				
				
					So, why not decide that shame is inevitable, that everyone feels it
						in her/his own <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>, and that therefore it is not useful to do
						anything with it except ilaugh at it and move on. We ignore the fact
						that we can't fly: we don't feel shame at not being able to overcome
						gravity. We do invent <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">airplanes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">banana</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peel</ENAMEX> jokes. We also
						invent philosophies, psychologies and religions that help transcend
						the blame and depression that are reactions to the inadequacy of the
						human brain. We even invent anti-depressants, most of which are
						pretty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">crude</ENAMEX> at this stage.
				
				
					Wild sex is one of the incommensurable feelings, bodily and social
						processes that sometimes breaks through the rigidities of "self" and
						allows us the relief of a dis-integration, of non-identity. It can't
						<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last</TIMEX>, because our mind/<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> cannot continue without the assertion of
						identity. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ecstasy</ENAMEX> means (from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>) outside the self.
				
				
					But nothing we have invented can overcome the basic problem that we
						can't integrate un-integrate-able differences; we want wild sex and
						we want domestic comfort. They can be made to coexist, but they
						can't be made into one stable thing. The recent history of gay sex,
						through sexual experimentation to the search for transcendence and
						blowing our minds to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> to post-<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> ennui and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">depression</ENAMEX> is, I
						think, evidence of our biological and social limitations.
				
				
					<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> 20th C gay white <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> were talking together. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> asked
						the other, "Do you smoke after intercourse?" The other replied, "I
						don't know, I've never looked."
				
				
					The Other is, of course, non-identical, different from me and
						different from itself. We all think <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">poop</ENAMEX> smells, but each of us
						thinks our own <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">poop</ENAMEX> actually smells pretty ok. We like its
						<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">familiarity</ENAMEX>, and hope it is the same every time. We like
						<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sameness</ENAMEX>--<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> particularly like sameness, and they seek to be the
						same all the time. They also like other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> because they are the
						same, familiar to the senses. It is possible for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> to imagine
						how another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> feels pooping, sweating, running, eating, laughing,
						being hurt, being afraid. Since he seeks to integrate his
						contradictory impulses, he looks to other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> for help and for
						models of how to do that.
				
				
					<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Woman</ENAMEX> must more clearly notice she is different every <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minute</TIMEX>, and
						markedly different through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the month</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Man</ENAMEX> looks to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> to be
						different, and cannot imagine integrating her except by inserting
						himself into her--fearfully entering into something different, with
						different smells and textures, unsure he is safe. Unsure whether he
						is doing the right thing or inflicting harm, he tells himself this
						is the natural thing to do, although he would feel more secure if
						she was familiar like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daddy</ENAMEX> and not mysterious like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mommy</ENAMEX>. Male
						<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">supremacy</ENAMEX> may be just homophobia--fear of same, not fear of
						<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homos</ENAMEX>--an misinterpretation of the safety of sameness into a demand
						for difference, an insistence on integration by inserting himself
						into Other, ruling her, it.
				
				
					If this were the case, our shame, the mind's conclusion that the
						biological incapacity of the mind to reconcile contradictory
						thoughts and feelings is to be interpreted as failure and inadequacy
						qua humanness, when in fact each human faces the same incapacity and
						deems her/himself a failure, may be inscribed in our "culture" as
						our desire for the Other to allow us an escape from the shame of
						being unable to do what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> by nature are not really able to
						do--to integrate.

			"It's put us at a little bit of a competitive disadvantage," he said.

			Hang around any schoolyard in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> or college <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">campus</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indonesia</ENAMEX>
				and it becomes clear that the recording industry's problems with the
				illegal online distribution of music in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> pale beside
				the rampant piracy that goes on overseas.
			
			The industry's biggest hurdle may be cultural. As is the case among
				many young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, swapping files and burning
				tracks on CD's are viewed in most <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> as routine, not renegade,
				behavior. After all, the most popular file-sharing software, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">KaZaA</ENAMEX>, was
				dreamed up by a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Swede</ENAMEX> and written by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> young <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Estonians</ENAMEX>.
			
			"I adored <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leslie Cheung</ENAMEX>, but if he made <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5 million</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2 million</NUMEX> a year
				doesn't matter to me, honestly speaking," said our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contestant</ENAMEX>, referring
				to the late gay <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> pop <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">star</ENAMEX> whose songs are actively swapped over
				the Internet.
			
			<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Piracy</ENAMEX>, of course, affects more than a pop <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">star</ENAMEX>'s paycheck. Sales of
				recorded music have plunged more steeply in several <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asian</ENAMEX>
				<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> than in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> because of a combination of file
				sharing, home CD burning and the mass production of knock-off disks. In
				<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>'s largest and hardest-hit market, sales have fallen by a
				<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last five years</TIMEX>. They are projected to decline <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">another 20</TIMEX>
				percent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX>, compared with a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12 percent</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">first-half</TIMEX> decline in the
				<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX>.
			
			These examples leave out <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>, where piracy exists on an entirely
				different scale. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Nine</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> recordings in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> are pirated,
				according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Federation of the Phonographic Industry</ENAMEX>,
				an umbrella group
			for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX> national industry <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>.
			
			File sharing appears to be as cross- cultural as any other type of
				<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">piracy</ENAMEX>. The amount of swapping in a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> generally correlates to the
				number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who have PC's with high-speed Internet connections.
			
			That case will be no easier to make in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bombay</ENAMEX> than it is in
				<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX>. Consider the crowded store hidden between the curry stands and
				photocopying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trisakti University</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jakarta</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indonesia</ENAMEX>.

					trained by the environment to emphasize the overcoming of

					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">species</ENAMEX>, unlike their closest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX> the arboreal chimps, are

				from: Production and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Art</ENAMEX>, by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leo</ENAMEX>
					Stoneberg, Ph.D., <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxbone Univ</ENAMEX>.
				We, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">All</ENAMEX>, speak and make tools beautifully. All do not merely
					"produce," as in productive labor; All are fully modern but have not
					had to distinguish the infrastructural "labor" of acquiring and
					cooking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> from the superstructural "leisure" of talking after
					eating or "ritual" of singing. It would be mistaken to see the life of
					All through the (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Marxist</ENAMEX>) Western lens of "the production of the
					material necessity of life," since All linvest our prodigious
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cognitive</ENAMEX> and emotive skills in everything we do, and have developed
					complex society in which connections to each other and to the rest of
					the world are felt very strongly-more strongly-felt through community
					than through individual sensoria. Living is not easy for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">All</TIMEX>: glaciers
					and the dangers of the hunt narrow our world; but All's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painters</ENAMEX>,
					<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">singers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dancers</ENAMEX> express and symbolize our cognitions in complex
					somatic, verbal and plastic form. It is important to note that All
					<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> are not "representing" reality; as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gog</ENAMEX> says, "All dance in
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trance</ENAMEX>. Send <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gog</ENAMEX> to look and mark. Gog paint allow animal to emerge
					from rock live with All."
				
				Gog enjoy primary (limbic) consciousness, like eat, sleep, fuck,
					trance
				Gog experience secondary (cerebral) consciousness as difficult, like
					plan, don't like make anxious or regretful
				In her award presentation, Miss <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Welch</ENAMEX> states,
				
				"For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">All</TIMEX>, the cerebral cortex is a (relatively) newly-evolved toolset
					without an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owner</ENAMEX>'s manual, and its habit of focusing attention on the
					processes of feeling and cognition has brought in train the dis-ease
					of narrating, stitching transitory sense impressions and feelings into
					coherent but sometimes worrisome speculations on causation. Gog, like
					the others, has a legitimate fear of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cave bears</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cave tigers</ENAMEX>. But
					All tend to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-interpret dark as fearful, mentally narrating the
					fear threaded with memories of past attacks and predictions of
					possible future pain that may obscure the core brain state of
					efficiently living in the present.
				This tendency in the darkness of life is brightened by a voluntary
					surrender to the shared ecstasy of safety and worship of fecundity,
					envisioned in the shape of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Goddess</ENAMEX>. Since evidence of the
					need for <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX> chromosomes is invisible to them, All experience
					sexual contact without deducing its role in reproduction or imposing
					the standard of reproduction on the sexual activity. All, like the
					bonobos, have sex with same and other-gender <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partners</ENAMEX>. All see that
					<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> are born from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. Their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> might be as
					matrifocal as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bonobos</ENAMEX>' as well."

					from the region of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Altair 4</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Krell</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>). I have spent <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX>
					revolutions of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX> around its star watching these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homo sapiens sapiens</ENAMEX>, I, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Trzz</ENAMEX> herself, am immaterial, which
					enables me/her to eavesdrop on spoken and unspoken language, taking on
					such forms as lichens on cave walls, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cave bear assailants</ENAMEX> on the
					attack, earwax of old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> exchanging formulas to ward off
					decrepitude-whatever form necessary to record the descriptions the
					humans generate as they experience their ritual life.
				
				I, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Trzz</ENAMEX>, believe that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> she/I observe seek <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> categories of
					holiness.
				One is the state or process of transcendence, knowing the ultimate,
					stepping out of self, through pain, ecstasy, whatever, into a feeling
					of unity, wholeness, of uniting with higher levels of being. These
					modes of transcendence are more or less known and knowable, and can be
					correlated with the levels of brain/mind consciousness
				The other category is the recognition and embrace of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Immanence</ENAMEX>,
					beyond epistemology, not a category of knowing, but one derived from
					the logic of inner and outer, self and other.
				
				I, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trzz</ENAMEX> note, "I reject the possible correlation of these two
					categories with the sexual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX> of labor among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> and
					ultimately with gender stereotyping. By the time of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">High</ENAMEX>
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paleolithic</ENAMEX> or Neolithic cultures of these caves, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">societies</ENAMEX> had
					evolved far beyond the basic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">divisions</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> rearing and other
					tasks. I have witnessed the fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> provide adequately for
					themselves and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, and share the surplus, through food
					gathering and hunting of small, nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>.
				Given the consequent fact (as I have observed here in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30,000</NUMEX> BC) that
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">social</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> rather than necessity selected for hunting, I
					conclude that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> developed hunting as a supplement, as something
					helpful but not usually necessary, something to do to exercise their
					brains and to take a more active role. Cooperation, and language, had
					already been established through experience of gathering, sharing and
					maintaining food and the health of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>-child groupings. All of
					these activities could be performed with the brain of a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Neanderthal</ENAMEX>,
					as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trzz</ENAMEX> has observed among the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Neanderthal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> who lived nearby the

				<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dear Trzz</ENAMEX>,
				I have seen your comments on this matter. Consider the following
					<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">propositions:</ENAMEX>
				1.The opening to immanent holiness in existence could be related to
					the evolution of the cerebral cortex and therefore to an unknowable
					knowing performed by the complex bundling of neural pathways but
					unavailable to consciousness.
				<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. The wonder felt at the "thusness" of everything might have its

				"How marvelous!" <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sighs Herr Rheinfahrt</ENAMEX>, transported by a medieval

				"I'd like that," says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph</ENAMEX>. "And let's throw in a cult of daily

				"<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ja</ENAMEX>, mein <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">schwartz Buddha</ENAMEX>, I love you, but sometimes that advice

					Taking advantage of the red herrings, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A & L</ENAMEX>, boldly don the

				"We know who you are: you are atheist <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">revolutionaries</ENAMEX>. You, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Caution</ENAMEX>,

					handing out maps and brochures.
				<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Manatee Info for Kids</ENAMEX> <savethemanatees.org>
				Manatees have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> type of teeth - molars. They are the type used for
					<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">grinding</ENAMEX> and work well for the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">manatees</ENAMEX> eat. The teeth in
					front wear down as the manatee gets older. But, new teeth form in the
					back of the jaw, moving forward to replace them. That tooth movement
					is called the "marching molars".
				Manatees are plant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">eaters</ENAMEX>. They feed on all sorts of sea <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>. An
					average manatee may eat <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100-150 pounds</NUMEX> of food <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each day</TIMEX>. They swallow
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sea</ENAMEX> squids or mollusks that may be attached to the seagrasses they
					eat. Also, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sand</ENAMEX> is often mixed with the food they eat. The gritty sand
					wears down the teeth.
				Brain, eyes, ears, whiskers are some of the body parts that help the
					manatee sense the world. The manatee ear bones are large and their
					hearing is believed to be good. They make sounds under water to "talk"
					to each other. The sounds are like chirps, whistles, or squeaks. Most
					of the sounds they make are too low a frequency for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> to hear.
					Their eyes are small but manatees have fairly good vision. They can
					tell differences between sizes of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX> and different colors and
					patterns. The manatee snout is covered with whiskers. They are sense
					organs, but their purpose is still not clear.
				It is believed that manatees are smart.
				
				To be continued . . .
				<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sirenia</ENAMEX>, cont'd.
				
				
				Their brain is very large and has a lot of gray matter. The gray
					matter is where thinking occurs. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manatees</ENAMEX> can learn tricks. Breathing:
					Although a manatee can stay under water for up to <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20 minutes</TIMEX>, it must
					come up to the surface to breathe air. When the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manatee</ENAMEX> reaches the
					surface, you can hear the air blown out of the mouth with a big burst
					of air. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Poof</ENAMEX>. Then you can hear the fresh air being sucked in.
				Manatees may live up to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60 years of age or more</TIMEX>. The oldest manatee
					now living is about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50 years old</TIMEX>. Manatees have no natural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enemies</ENAMEX>.
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Sharks</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">alligators</ENAMEX> do not usually hunt them. Most premature deaths
					occur from cold weather and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>. Fast-moving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> usually kill
					several <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">manatees</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every year</TIMEX>.
				Fossils of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">manatees</ENAMEX> found in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX>'s springs have been estimated to
					be <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about 45 million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years old</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fossils</ENAMEX> found in other parts of the
					world may be as old <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as 60 million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>. The modern manatees evolved
					from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-footed land mammals. Their closest living relative is the
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">elephant</ENAMEX>. (For extra credit see footnote <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>.)

					to their aspirations and doubts with encouraging tenderness and
					<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">penetration</ENAMEX>. They are also eager to help her progress in her

				Lemmy, under some suspicion after he was seen cruising on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekends</TIMEX>
					around the glory hole <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">booths</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XTC Video</ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Daytona Beach</ENAMEX>, is made

				While they are en route, we check in on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cyril</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vyvyan</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cy</ENAMEX> is
					supine on the floor of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Jebel Ali Free Zone</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mall</ENAMEX>, having fainted
					while arguing with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vyv</ENAMEX> all the way from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Dubai Airport</ENAMEX>.
				"<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cyril</ENAMEX>," screams <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vyvyan</ENAMEX>, wake up! Oh, will someone please bring some

				The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mall</ENAMEX> security quickly bring a portable infibulator, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> and
					<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cyril</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">swims</ENAMEX> slowly back to the light in this desert <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">oasis</ENAMEX>.
				"<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ohhh</ENAMEX>," he moans, as he recognizes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vyv</ENAMEX>. "My dear, I was in a dark
					grotto, like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Capri</ENAMEX>, and everything smelled so astringently sea clean."
					<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cy</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vyv</ENAMEX> had been arguing about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cyril</ENAMEX>'s obsession that others think
					he smells bad. After <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an 11-hour</TIMEX> flight from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX>, his rumpled mind
					confused the oliferous perspiration of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Airport</ENAMEX> and Jebel
					<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ali</ENAMEX> with a morbid preoccupation with his own age-specific
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">putrefaction</ENAMEX>.
				"Ever since <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Hard Day's Night Cyril</ENAMEX> has been washing, douching and
					<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">perfuming</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lady Macbeth</ENAMEX>," dithers <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vyvyan</ENAMEX> to the fetching but

					bonkers about being a clean old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>."
				On the flight <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cyril</ENAMEX> was seated next to a stellar <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">backpacker</ENAMEX>,
					very blue-eyed and ruddy. He inhaled the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">delicious acrid</ENAMEX> fragrances of
					the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX>'s armpits and crotch, with puissant bottom notes of of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pee</ENAMEX> and
					arse, and fretted about the leaks of gas he himself was detonating on
					what he hoped was an unsuspecting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planeload</ENAMEX>. Elaborately moving his

				<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manatees, Dugong</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sea Cow</ENAMEX>
				This order of aquatic mammals contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> Recent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dugongidae</ENAMEX> for the genera <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dugong</ENAMEX> (dugong, one species) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hydrodamalis</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Steller</ENAMEX>'s sea <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cow</ENAMEX>, one species,
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">extinct</ENAMEX>); and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trichechidae</ENAMEX> for the single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genus</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trichechus</ENAMEX> (manatees, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> species). The dugong inhabits
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coastal</ENAMEX> regions in the tropical parts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Old World</ENAMEX>, but some
					<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> go into the fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> of estuaries and up rivers.
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Steller</ENAMEX>'s sea cow occurred in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bering Sea</ENAMEX>, being the only recent
					<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of this order adapted to cold <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Manatees</ENAMEX> live along the
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coast</ENAMEX> and in coastal rivers in the southeastern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central</ENAMEX>
					<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">West Indies</ENAMEX>, northern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South America</ENAMEX>, and western <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX>.
				
				Sirenians are solitary, travel in pairs, or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">associate</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of
					<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>. Generally slow and inoffensive, they
					spend all their life in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>. They are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vegetarians</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">feed</ENAMEX> on
					various water <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>. They are the only mammals that have evolved to
					exploit plant life in the sea margin (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anderson 1979).</ENAMEX> The ordinal name <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sirenia</ENAMEX> is related to the
					supposed mermaidlike nursing of dugongs (thought to be the origin of
					the myths of the sirens) and manatees. The only reliable observations
					of nursing in manatees, however, have revealed that the young suckle
					while the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> is underwater in a horizontal position, belly
					downward. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">P. K. Anderson</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1984a</NUMEX>) reported that suckling in the dugong is
					somewhat similar but that the calf usually is in an inverted position.
				
				The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sirenia</ENAMEX> often are classified together with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Proboscidea</ENAMEX> and
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hyracoidea</ENAMEX> in the mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">superorder Paenungulata</ENAMEX>. The geological
					range of the order <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sirenia</ENAMEX> is early <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eocene</ENAMEX> to Recent. The earliest
					fossils are from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hungary</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>. By the middle Eocene the order was
					present in southeastern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North America</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">West Indies</ENAMEX>, southern
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, northern and eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX>, and south-central <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX>, and three
					distinct <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>--the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dugongidae, Prorastomidae</ENAMEX>, and
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Protosirenidae</ENAMEX>--had evolved (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dawson</ENAMEX> and
						Krishtalka <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1984</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Domning, Morgan</ENAMEX>, and
					<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ray 1982).</ENAMEX> These aquatic mammals were apparently more abundant
					from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oligocene</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pliocene</ENAMEX> than they are now. Their
					comparative scarcity at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the present time</TIMEX> probably results from
					climatic changes in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pliocene</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pleistocene</ENAMEX> and, more recently,
					exploitation by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX>, hides, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX>. The number of
					individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sirenians</ENAMEX> remaining in the world, perhaps <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60,000</NUMEX>, is far
					smaller than that of any other mammalian order.

				"Now we'll see some action," hopes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Novy</ENAMEX>.
				<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Merle</ENAMEX> gradually fades from the picture as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX> official moves

				"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Thank the Goddess of Compassion Quan Yin</ENAMEX>, she didn't have time to

				Novy grasps the laptop from the putti and begins an immediate search

				33 Terror in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cologne</ENAMEX>
				Lemmy imagines, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Siegfried</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph</ENAMEX> are on the road to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cologne</ENAMEX>,
					once the center of heretical antinomianism:
				"How marvelous!" <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sighs Herr Rheinfahrt</ENAMEX>, transported by a medieval
					woodcut of the cultus of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Swabian Ries</ENAMEX>. "These itinerant beghards (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX>)
					and beguines (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>) were <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">'immoral58</TIMEX>.' Imagine being
					accused of gorging on rich <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX> and guzzling fine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wines</ENAMEX> in the houses
					of the rich. What a life, and very subversive, walking from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> to
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">town</ENAMEX> , spreading the word that the poor are not just future inheritors
					of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kingdom of Heaven</ENAMEX>, but they can be in it right now! Tramping
					around, not worrying about how slow walking is compared to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bus</ENAMEX> or

				"I'd like that," says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph</ENAMEX>. "And let's throw in a cult of daily

					And, of course, purity of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soul</ENAMEX> would put them all beyond petty

				"Better yet, they indulge their urges in homosexual acts."
				Around a campfire in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rhineland</ENAMEX>, your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> around you. Somebody

				You. I stroke your hair, your beard, your manly chest. Your scent is

				Your eyes. I first wanted you because of your brook-blue eyes under

				<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Siegfried</ENAMEX> sniffles as his eyes refocus on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Autobahn</ENAMEX>. "Oh, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph</ENAMEX>,
					to walk the mountains with the wandervogels

				<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph</ENAMEX> answers, in calm compassion, "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herr S.</ENAMEX>, your memory is a

				"<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ja</ENAMEX>, mein <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">schwartz Buddha</ENAMEX>, I love you, but sometimes that advice

				34 Terror in Cologne2
				In the crypt under the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">cathedral</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aachen</ENAMEX>, under torture, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Siegfried</ENAMEX>
					confesses:
				
				He knew it was the anti-depressants, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSRIs</ENAMEX>, but he couldn't
					remember when he'd last enjoyed sex. He'd gotten off the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> in
					<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Havana</ENAMEX>, was met by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dionisio</ENAMEX>, and D had taken him to bed as soon as
					they got to 's casa particular. Dionisio, rubusto in his piel de canela, rubbed his
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">penis</ENAMEX> against him, kissing deep as he could, and S masturbated himself
					to orgasm, feeling embarrassed at how long it took and how his
					descending balls were thrown around by the rapid and almost-painful
					flying grip. That was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than a year ago</TIMEX> and he'd only jerked off a
					few times since. He was occasionally surprised by spacetime warps of
					desire. And what had love felt like?
				
				"Keep him awake <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">all night</TIMEX>," Ollie growls. "He's going to give up all
					of it!"
				As he thought about it now, he thought his sexual appetite had never
					lasted <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">more than about fifteen minutes</TIMEX> at a time. He'd had that
					<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fifteen</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a thousand</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>, but that had been about it-what
					satisfied him, as well as he could remember.
				The sex he <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> had was with himself. R<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">___ G___</ENAMEX> had taught him to
					<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">jack</ENAMEX> off around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 13</TIMEX> and he'd refused to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">69</NUMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ricky T___</ENAMEX> and that
					other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V___</ENAMEX> because he didn't like the smell of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V</ENAMEX>'s crotch. Now, he
					confessed, the smell was his own. He had grown increasingly concerned
					about his own smell, worried about whether his gas leaks and pissy
					underwear offended others, as he was certain the tobacco <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">odors</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
					packs per day did.
				"Try stripping him and leaving him in a cold shower for a
					while-that'll get him singing," says the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> in black.
				He'd always had a boyish way that drew stronger protective types.
					He'd enjoyed that so much that he'd never learned to be anybody else.
					He'd always been drawn himself to the iron-willed drag <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">queen</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tanye</ENAMEX> and
					others who were boldly exotic. They were badges he would put on to
					make himself authentic/. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Years</TIMEX> of criticism and self-criticism had
					made him more adept at the presentation of a self as sympathetic
					<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Blacks</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Latinos</ENAMEX>. He took seriously the
					generosity with which Others (especially Black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>) granted him the
					right to exist. Race and position in a hierarchy of gender/sexuality
					had always been the most important markers in his sexual adventures.
					He was glad he'd had them but anxious when he asked-or was
					asked-whether he had any authentic self of his own.
				
				"We're not sure this old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> has any authentic self of his own,"
					reported the junior black-suit to Ollie <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South</ENAMEX>. "He's telling us a
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">great</ENAMEX> deal, but his guilt is hard to prove."
				"Never mind the proof, that's for sissies and appeals <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX>," <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South</ENAMEX>
					tells the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">interrogators</ENAMEX>. "Just keep him talking. Try the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>."
				He knew by now the question had to be answered with a yes; after all,
					he did choose within the limitations of history and genetics. And he
					also knew the question and its answer taken together were a trap,
					sucking him into an illusory comparison of selves, reifying an idea
					that did him no good, and could only add to all the negative feelings
					of deficiency he confused himself with. He knew there is no authentic
					<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">self</ENAMEX>, as there is no God, as ther is no deep reality, as Niels Bohr
					used to tell him.l But it was hard work to remember there is no
					<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">authentic</ENAMEX>, and his political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">comrades</ENAMEX> and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">revolutionary</ENAMEX> project
					had helped keep all that at <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only barking</NUMEX> distance. He couldn't
					remember anymore what it was like to love anyone, let alone love the
					<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>.
				
				"His consciousness is clearly shattered under the yage," <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South</ENAMEX> was certain. "Now for the sodomizing
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">humiliations</ENAMEX>."
				He wasn't sure he could remember how <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> talk to each other. He
					was always impatient with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>' recitations of their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ins</ENAMEX> and
					outs-who did them wrong and how they recouped their self-regard, or
					not. He thought such talk was trivial and tried to not tell such
					tales, even to himself. It was difficult for a compulsive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">repeater</ENAMEX> who
					was used to saying over and over some phrase or song that caught in
					his mind.
				He understood now that nothing happened unless he wanted it to. The
					humblings must have been something he wanted, and the unhappinesses
					he'd thought stemmed from his deficiencies were feelings he'd
					obviouswly cultivated.
				And somehow, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few years ago</TIMEX>, he began to take the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pills</ENAMEX> and
					everything changed. He was no longer so sure he was an unhappy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>;
					in fact, he felt pretty richtig most of the time and his brain was
					freer to think and play. If that happened because he swallowed an
					organic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemical</ENAMEX> it must mean his mind in its ceaseless processing
					must have been interpreting in a particular way, a way that he no
					longer had to experience. His unhappiness was an interpretation that
					was not necessary; he could just as well be <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> and observant,
					mindful of how his narration of the extended recent time did not
					require that he feel his life was unhappy. He tried to say, "I'm doing
					<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ok</ENAMEX>, things are ok." He tried to say, "I notice that I feel down, that
					the world seems futile and tiring, especially in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX>." And "I
					<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">notice</ENAMEX> that my mind is engaged and ticking more productively later in
					<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX>." And "I notice that I sleep a lot, and maybe that is
					compensation for reduced <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">REM</ENAMEX> or deep sleep on account of sleeping
					<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pills</ENAMEX>." And ". . ."
				
				<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Siegfried</ENAMEX> gasps, wanting to please Ollie, "Is this honest enough?"
				<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South</ENAMEX> finds it takes very little to get S to talk, but his talk
					doesn't seem to identify any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">culprits</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ollie</ENAMEX> wants plots and
					<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">conspiracies</ENAMEX>, and all he gets are the rambling self-accusations of an
					old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>.
				With <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph</ENAMEX> it is another matter. He, still considered a fugitive BLA
					outlaw, is subjected to all the usual tortures used on political
					<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prisoners</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Leavenworth</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lexington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>.59

				Dear Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South</ENAMEX>:
				
				How are you? I am fine. I am a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">seventh</NUMEX> grade at the

					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>. My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classmates</ENAMEX> and I have been reading in class about you and the
					old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> named Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Siegfried Rheinfahrt</ENAMEX>. We are writing to ask you to
					stop torturing him and to to release Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rheinfahrt</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph</ENAMEX>
					<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jamal</ENAMEX>. They are good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, and you should not be abusing them.
				Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">South</ENAMEX> I know you worked for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US Government</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> and
					<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nicaragua</ENAMEX> and now help our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brave Soldiers</ENAMEX> by questioning <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in
					<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kabul</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guantanamo</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baghdad</ENAMEX>. But you are not helping Our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cause</ENAMEX> by
					taking pictures of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prisoners</ENAMEX> have sex with each other. Sex should
					be between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> who say "Okay, let's have sex' (with each
					other, I mean.) Our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Father Michelin Pirelli</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">III</ENAMEX>, of The

					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catholic Church</ENAMEX>, Old <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Latin</ENAMEX> Order, has always required that we say
					"Okay" before we have sex with him or go to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">basement</ENAMEX> for
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chastisement</ENAMEX>. (By the way, it is done the right way-nuns whip the boys
					and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priests</ENAMEX> whip the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX>.) When they put The Question to us, I
					always answer "Yes" politely, so I get the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat o'nine tails</ENAMEX>, which
					feels a lot more fun than the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cane</ENAMEX>. I think you should follow our
					example. And then let them go, because they have always said "Okay" to
					having sex, maybe even with each other. They might even have sex with
					you if you asked better.

				A message beeps in on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South</ENAMEX>'s Blackberry-powered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journadaâ„¢ wireless</ENAMEX>,
					and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South</ENAMEX> is confronted with a photo of himself naked, simulating

				"What about the old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>?"
				Memory floods the synapses with a message once sung to him (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">by J</ENAMEX> or B
					or R ?):
				
				Yes, it's love I offer you and hope that you will keep.
				This love you see is true, from me;--but no-it is to weep,
				For you-pale white-cannot <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">trust</ENAMEX> love from whom you've loved too long
				And yet deride with untaught pride-myh love is far too strong
				So what thing can I offer you? What gift is there to give?
				Not even dreams, or so it seems-for you refuse to live.

				"Rheinfahrt stays. I think he knows more than he's told us. Get the
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Softening Machine</ENAMEX>. I'm going to go <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nova</ENAMEX> on his ass."
				<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Siegfried</ENAMEX>, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ollie</ENAMEX> hopes, is gratified to be lubricated and
					piston-evacuated. In a puddle on the floor, he thankfully blurts out
					what he thinks his dreadful interrogator wants to know.
				"There is no actual conspiracy; there doesn't need to be a
					conspiracy. The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Twelve Links of Interdependent</ENAMEX> Origination61 explain that all <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substance</ENAMEX> is composed of
					non-self <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substances</ENAMEX>, and therefore no deep reality behind <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substance</ENAMEX> is
					to be found.
				Bohr was in contact with the timeless <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Pali canon</ENAMEX> and
					he and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>, during their three-way marathon writhing with
					Heisenberg, they agreed on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Copenhagen Interpretation</ENAMEX>: The world we
					see around us is real enough, but . . . everyday phenomena are
					themselves built not out of phenomena but out of an utterly different
					kind of being. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wernie Heisenberg</ENAMEX> told me, 'The hope that new
					experiments will lead us back to objective events in time and space is
					<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about</TIMEX> as well founded as the hope of discovering the end of the world
					in the unexplored regions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Antarctic</ENAMEX>.' And <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">N. David Mermin</ENAMEX> adds,
					'We now know that the moon is demonstrably not there when nobody
						looks<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.62</NUMEX>'
				"In social systems," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Siegfried</ENAMEX> groans out between thrusts of the
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Softening Machine</ENAMEX>, "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Freddie Hayek</ENAMEX> tells me, '[t]his means that, though
					the use of spontaneous ordering <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> enables us to induce the
					formation of an order of such a degree of complexity (namely
					comprising elements of such numbers, diversity and variety of
					conditions) as we could never master intellectually, or deliberately
					arrange, we will have less power over the details of such an order
					than we would of one which we produce by arrangement.'63"
				
				"You post-modernist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commies</ENAMEX> are all alike!" <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ollie bellows</ENAMEX>. "What

				"We thought Communism might be better if we stopped planning so much.

				The author admits he made <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Siegfried Rheinfahrt</ENAMEX> up. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Siegfried</ENAMEX> isn't
					even his real name. He was christened in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Nicholas Church</ENAMEX> in
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leipzig</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1908</TIMEX> as just ordinary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Jacob Jingelheimer Schmidt</ENAMEX>, but
					<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> would all shout at him. As a chorister the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> would have sung
					the works of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Church</ENAMEX>'s most famous kappelmeister, JS <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bach</ENAMEX>. He often referred to this music as the
					"architecture of life," meaning that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bach</ENAMEX> provided a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> for his
					understanding during the complex changes he was to face throughout a
					long and difficult.
				The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> documentary evidence of his name change is in his
					membership card in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Der Eigene</ENAMEX>, a physical strength <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> with
					intellectual ties to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goethe</ENAMEX>'s seminal romantic novel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Werther</ENAMEX>. His youthful enthusiasm for camping and nude swimming
					left him-although not his liaisons with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> upper-class
					<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homosexuals</ENAMEX>, one of which is thinly disguised in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spender</ENAMEX>'s The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX>-- as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Deutschland</ENAMEX> grew darker.
				His thought, as recorded in his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">his years</TIMEX> at the
					University in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Freiberg</ENAMEX>, was first inflamed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cult</ENAMEX> around <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stefan</ENAMEX>
					<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Georg</ENAMEX>, but far more illumined by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hesse</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Journey to</ENAMEX>
						the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East</ENAMEX>. Although his philosophical studies show his great
					<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">love and aptitude for Heidegger</ENAMEX>, then <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX>, soon to be <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rector</ENAMEX>, at
					Freiberg, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> remembers an increasing discomfort with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX>'s "swooning for
					a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX>" who would throw himself and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dasein</ENAMEX>. He
					is said by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classmate</ENAMEX> to have urinated on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX>'s holograph of
						Also <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sprach</ENAMEX> . . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Disenchanted</ENAMEX>, unwilling to
					accept "the hysterical mystifications of right-wing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">graecophiles</ENAMEX>,"
					<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rheinfahrt</ENAMEX> left his studies and under the swaying of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Christopher</ENAMEX>
					Caudwell, he joined the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Communist Party</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1928</TIMEX>.
				<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Comrades</ENAMEX> from that time equivocate, but refuse to agree to his
					description of himself as physically repellent; they note his
					<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">honey-blond</ENAMEX> hair worn slightly too long and asking for the discipline
					of a good brushing, a well-developed physique and a mind quick to
					<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">discern</ENAMEX> tactical opportunities in the contestations with the emerging
					<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Nazi</ENAMEX> movement. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Viewers</ENAMEX> may catch a glimpse of him as he speaks to a
					<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Berliners</ENAMEX> evicted from their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brecht</ENAMEX>'s
					semi-documentary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kuhle Wampe</ENAMEX>.
				Unlike many of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Siegfried</ENAMEX> was convinced by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1932</TIMEX> that the
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nazis</ENAMEX> would take state power in order to save capitalism for the
					<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> bourgeoisie and its <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX>. He disappeared, faking
					his death at the hands of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Brown Shirts</ENAMEX> in a riot in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX>, and
					embarked for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moscow</ENAMEX> for military and political training. Although
					independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corroboration</ENAMEX> is not to be had, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journal</ENAMEX> entry in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1936</TIMEX>
					makes evident that he was back in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>, involved with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lutheran</ENAMEX>
					<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minister</ENAMEX> whom we know only as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Dietrich B___</ENAMEX>. His recollection is that
					"<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dietrich</ENAMEX> and I worshiped with great fervor," although he smiles as if
					to ssay this is not to be taken seriously from a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Comintern</ENAMEX>-trained
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">atheist</ENAMEX>. It may reflect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX>'s disquiet about his sexual proclivities: he
					writes a sad record of longing and vacillation in his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two-year</TIMEX>
					courtship of a certain <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karen</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Danish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">psychoanalyst</ENAMEX>, and his almost
					immediate divorce from her after their marriage in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1938</TIMEX>. Despite
					considerable effort expended by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>, no clarity as to the
					identity or subsequent fate of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karen</ENAMEX> can be offered here. The
					precipitous rejection may have been followed by more dangerous events,
					as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karen</ENAMEX> is said to be of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX>, perhaps <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX>, extraction.
				The name <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Siefried</ENAMEX> appears frequently after that time in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Soviet</ENAMEX>
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">archives</ENAMEX> of clandestine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX>. Recently released and decoded, the
					papers indicate a leading role for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rheinfahrt</ENAMEX> in the armed resistance
					to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Nazis</ENAMEX> within <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX> may denigrate the efforts
					and the role of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Communists</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX>, but the prominence
					of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rheinfahrt</ENAMEX> is certainly the reason why he was to emerge as a major
					figure in the liberated <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Democratic Republic of Germany</ENAMEX>.
				What marks <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rheinfahrt</ENAMEX>'s activity in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Party</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Government</ENAMEX> in
					(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">East</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> is the frequent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">criticisms</ENAMEX> and self-criticism he
					underwent. Apparently <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> was not enthusiastic about the transfer of
					industrial assets to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Soviet Union</ENAMEX>, and he is probably the unnamed
					party <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> who was sent twice for proletarian internationalist
					education to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moscow</ENAMEX>. He returned each time chastened but quickly
					involved in new controversies. During debates over development of
					<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Leipzig</ENAMEX>'s huge chemical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> is known to have said, "We don't
					want to stink up our <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> for all future generations." He was
					finally sent to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lubeck</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Baltic</ENAMEX> coast, where he oversaw harbor
					and shipping <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX>.
				He married his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cook</ENAMEX> after she sustained a cerebral infarction in
					<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1974</TIMEX>. Much of his writing of the time speaks fondly of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helga</ENAMEX>:
				My shriveling crabapple:
				I am fond of you.
				Your <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX> and cigarettes smell dirty to me,
				And I regret that I am inadequate in love.
				
				It is not difficult to discern, hidden in this little poem, an
					expression of great regret that he felt himself inadequate in love.
					Found among the secret file of his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX> is a photograph from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1973</TIMEX>,
					taken on a beach, of a nude young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> draped over a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Trabant</ENAMEX>, a photo
					that he must have treasured, as he brought it with him into exile when
					he left <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1980</TIMEX>. He has lived in a series of residential
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hotels</ENAMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that time</TIMEX>, eking out <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">his days</TIMEX> with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">faithful friend</ENAMEX> as
					he nears the age of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>.

				Achmed-Oedipa for now-put down the illustrated pamphlet she was
					memorizing with little enthusiasm. "What drivel, set in what regular
					feet!" she exclaimed inwardly, never yielding the least outward sign
					of disbelief. She was well on her way to a ranking position within the
					undulating Sirenian orders, one where she would be privy to the
					deepest secret plans of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. "I can't fish out the actual steps
					they are taking, besides building tourist traps with surplus
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">submarines</ENAMEX>. What is the meaning of the turbans? I must get to the
					bottom of this."
				<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">40 Venison Bride</ENAMEX> becomes a prophet
				Born in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December of 1948</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Venison Bride</ENAMEX> grew up in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cornish</ENAMEX>
					<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section of Manistique</ENAMEX>, spending most of his youth looking dreamily
					from the cliffs over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lake</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Superior</ENAMEX>, vaguely persuaded that something
					special was coming his way. "The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wells Fargo Wagon</ENAMEX>" always had a
					special <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poignancy</ENAMEX> for him, as did the underwear ads-no, any ads for
					<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>'s clothing (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">few</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">True</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Argosy</ENAMEX> but plentiful in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Esquire</ENAMEX>.) He
					was precociously literary, having found <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clifton Fadiman</ENAMEX>'s Lifetime
					Reading Plan at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 11</TIMEX> in a revolving paperback display at the
					drugstore while awaiting his orthodontist appointment. He read all the
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Great Books</ENAMEX> dutifully, racing to find out how each ended, annoyed at
					the peculiarities of style that made <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stendhal</ENAMEX> different from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Balzac</ENAMEX> or
					Homer from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Virgil</ENAMEX>. He learned from another volume in the same display
					that his sexual fantasies about the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crew-cutted athletes</ENAMEX> in his school
					were not normal, and that they had a name; in fact, he was most
					devastated to learn that his urinary appendage had a name and a
					different function, and he cried in embarrassment upon learning
					"penis"was the accepted name for what he and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brothers</ENAMEX> were taught
					to call the "wetter." And "vagina" was too confounding altogether.
					Having no <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sisters</ENAMEX>, never having caught his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> without her girdle,
					he was not so sure where this vagina was located or what it did.
					Ignoring it all was by far the best course, he concluded.
				Venison was named by his mother, who thought her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> had a "freakish,
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gamey</ENAMEX> look." His <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>, a sarcastic reformed drunk, predicted that
					"he'd have an odd taste, not like ordinary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meat</ENAMEX>," and it was true:
					like all <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Scandinavians</ENAMEX>, his sweat was sharp and acrid, a combination
					of genetics and overindulgence in rutabagas and lutefisk. He exhibited
					only the qualities of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meat</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>'s frozen <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> locker, none of
					the grace or equanimity of the live <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX>, and had the look of one
					larded with strips of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fat</ENAMEX> through his flesh and ready for roasting.
				He spent all his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer days</TIMEX> in the woods, moving from mossy stumps
					to damp rocks. He liked the uprightness of the third-generation piney
					<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">woods</ENAMEX>, following <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">deer trails</ENAMEX> he would look up to the cathedrals of the
					forest with a longing to worship something, even the spare sunlight
					between the rain-laden clouds scudding over from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lake</ENAMEX>. His reading
					had brought him to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Watts</ENAMEX>, and he imagined himself a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zen</ENAMEX> hermit,
					sketched with a sumi-e brush in fuzzy lines in a woody cleft between
					limestone walls. Far better to think of himself as a hermit in bosky
					seclusion than a rejected, overweight and soggy egghead.
				
				In his dreary high school, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ven</ENAMEX> felt himself isolated and befriended
					only his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX>, making a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mentor</ENAMEX> and confessor out of a recent
					graduate of the heavily-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Finnish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Houghton Tech</ENAMEX> who taught physics and
					chemistry. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nuola</ENAMEX> wore his flaxen <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hair</ENAMEX> in a flattop and neglected
					to shave the fine hairs that grew at the top of his Mongolian
					cheekbones, rendering him more manly in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venison</ENAMEX>'s eye and even less
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resistible</ENAMEX> in the eyes of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a</NUMEX>-line skirted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> who gazed with
					confusing desire at the porcelain skin revealed in the hollow between
					his clavicles under starchy, not-quite-expertly ironed collars and
					too-narrow bow ties.
				Chemistry was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Venison</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meat</ENAMEX>. He loved making <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">banana</ENAMEX> smells of esters
					and quickly moved on to more complicated organic molecules. It was a
					short run from there to the distillation of epinephrine from Drixan
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inhalers</ENAMEX> and a growing taste for perspiring, gasping conversations
					with his only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ambrose Broussard</ENAMEX>, a very dark <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French Canadian</ENAMEX>,
					originally <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX>, farmboy. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ambrose</ENAMEX> suffered from obsessive-compulsive
					<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tendencies</ENAMEX>, often walking backwards for <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">miles</NUMEX> to erase what had
					happened <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> on the same route. It was he who led <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Venison</ENAMEX> to the
					loft above the horse <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stalls</ENAMEX> for long heart-to-hearts and masturbation
					as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> rains raised the smells of damp <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">hay</ENAMEX> and animal excretions.
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ven</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amby</ENAMEX> wrote away for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> glory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seeds</ENAMEX> and explored their
					higher consciousness with the aid of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFIF</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Native American</ENAMEX>
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peyote Church</ENAMEX>, to which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ambrose</ENAMEX> had a legal claim to belong, trudging
					through deep snows out onto the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice crags</ENAMEX> to peer into the fluorescent
					blue <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> unfrozen underneath.
				It was while staring into the impossibly deep waters of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lake</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Superior</ENAMEX>
					that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Venison</ENAMEX> received the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> intimations of his special mission and
					of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mankind</ENAMEX>'s aquatic mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peers</ENAMEX>. He learned that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> were
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hairless</ENAMEX> because they were originally aquatic apes, able to evolve
					into standing bipeds with the aid of the buoyant waters of the ages
					when they first emerged from the arboreal ecosystems that had limited
					them to chimp socialities.
				In his speed-reading he also happened on early studies of neuro
					anatomy, and found himself zeroing in on the hypothalamus.
				(<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hÂ´Â´pthlÂ´ms)Â </ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">KEY)Â </ENAMEX>, an important supervisory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">center</ENAMEX> in the brain,
					<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rich</ENAMEX> in ganglia, nerve <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX>, and synaptic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">connections</ENAMEX>. It is
					composed of several sections called nuclei, each of which controls a
					specific function. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hypothalamus</ENAMEX> regulates body temperature, blood
					pressure, heartbeat, metabolism of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fats</ENAMEX> and carbohydrates, and sugar
					levels in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX>. Through direct attachment to the pituitary gland,
					the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hypothalamus</ENAMEX> also <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">meters</NUMEX> secretions controlling water balance and
					<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk</ENAMEX> production in the female. The role of the hypothalamus in
					awareness of pleasure and pain has been well established in the
					laboratory. It is thought to be involved in the expression of
					<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">emotions</ENAMEX>, such as fear and rage, and in sexual behaviors. Despite its
					numerous vital functions, the hypothalamus in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> accounts for only
					<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1/300</NUMEX> of total brain weight, and is about the size of an almond<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.66</NUMEX>
				
				
				How exciting to think that a part of the human brain was evolved from
					the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>, and how plausible, looking past the gnostoc into the cold
					waters of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lake</ENAMEX>, that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> would be happier if they lived there
					without the elaboration of aggressive behaviors exhibited by the
					savage <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> in gym class. How much better to be without these
					functions and to live as the sturgeon once did in these waters.

				"You can get a nice date milkshake and we'll join you at the

				Suddenly, they were thrown to the ground by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sheikh</ENAMEX>'s bodyguards,

					connected.
				"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Well</ENAMEX>, dears," said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bikki</ENAMEX>, "I think we had better rethink the plans."
				Cyril was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX>. "No, it's much safer in the desert than across the

					<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Aires</ENAMEX>?
				The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sheik</ENAMEX> agreed, adding, "I will send a couple of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Neddy</ENAMEX>'s

				"Oh, I had such a good <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekend</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Djibouti</ENAMEX> . . . <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX>, of

				" It's always something! My eyes hurt and they're blurry." He smokes

					voting for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kerry</ENAMEX> is only an unpleasant <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step in a genuinely

					require that we accede to-nay, accelerate-the decline and fall of the

				Pulling the last puff on a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marlboro</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Menthol Ultra Light</ENAMEX> before the

				"I should cut away all the digressions here," he breathes out with

				Yeah, yeah, we should act to vote out the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheney</ENAMEX> war-mongers,
					but let's act for something better and bigger. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> is not just a
					waste of lives over an <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">oilfield</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> is a strategic battlefield where

					suffocation of ordinary <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> lives, fight young <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Iraqis</ENAMEX> who hope
					for something very similar. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Inexperienced</ENAMEX>, naive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fighters</ENAMEX> are pitted

					power: look at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sudan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indonesia</ENAMEX>.70
				
				
				No matter who gets elected on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Nov 2</TIMEX>, neither <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kerry</ENAMEX> nor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> will ever
					dare to address the most important issue: what is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>? Our
					<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">homeland</ENAMEX>? No, it's a military and political shield operating to
					dominate the global market, a market that doesn't care what ordinary
					<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> want. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kerry</ENAMEX> both use the rhetoric of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">security</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> power, but neither will admit that it's not even
					about this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> as a great <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> is over. We were, maybe,
					maybe, weighing the ideals (and the failures) of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jefferson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lincoln</ENAMEX>
					and all, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> that embodied greatness once. But we are not any
						<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more.71</NUMEX>
				
				
				<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hey</ENAMEX>, What Happened?
				
				We, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who used be so productive, were lulled out of our
					vitality by corporate grasping and by big demand for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> goods and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US</ENAMEX>
					dollars, until the stock market took its dreadful dive in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000-2001</TIMEX>.
					Prosperity was, of course, not spread equally among us: the average
					income declined but corporate income skyrocketed to the top. Most
					<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">working people</ENAMEX> have clung to belief in a future that afforded
					a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX>, college for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>, insurance even for domesticated
					<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partners</ENAMEX>--until the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> economy was converted from production of goods
					to production of money and financial equities. That future was a
					little like an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LA</ENAMEX> garden, all exotic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>, tended and watered by
					<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and resources brought from across the borders. Now not just our
					<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">jobs</ENAMEX>, but even our money has gone overseas-to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> that actually
					produce things. All <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> can offer is flex-time service work that
					only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX> can afford to take. Even the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX> are taking pay
					cuts because of outsourcing.
				
				It Looks Bad
				So, instead of despair over the loss of good old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>, let's take
					a compassionate look at the whole planet: living <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">creatures</ENAMEX> nearly
					ruined, cherished moral and religious ideals perverted into family
					values, and competing, hostile <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nations</ENAMEX> can not control. A
					stronger, more secure <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> is a nostalgic fantasy. And we cannot
					expect to negotiate our way out of continual wars either, because we
					blindly let <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporations</ENAMEX> sell our birthright for a mess of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> and
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">silicon</ENAMEX> chips--they use up all the bargaining chips. Neither <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kerry</ENAMEX> nor
					<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>, neither good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cop</ENAMEX> nor bad <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cop</ENAMEX>, can pacify, let alone rectify,
					this mess.
				
				What do we do now?
				Voting out <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheney</ENAMEX> could stimulate worldwide ideals of
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">freedom</ENAMEX>, democracy and peace. We will be more secure if we dismantle
					<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> and open the whole garden. We can fight for a global order
					that's fits for this earth, based on the desires we share with all
					<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> everywhere. Things worth fighting for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">right now</TIMEX>:
				
					No Borders! (no border defense)

				It's sad, isn't it? What we love is here, in this place. Where we are

					become affect, our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> and our brains do that in this place and we
					call our place <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>. We need to find some way to keep the love, but

				<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BBC World News</ENAMEX> tells our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heroes</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Kenyan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> have no

					<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> added.
				In a special program produced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FOX News Africa</ENAMEX>, the blustery

				"The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> need to be harsher,'' he said. "There have been too many

				But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNN</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">correspondents</ENAMEX> praised the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>: "The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> has

				"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Happy Anniversary</ENAMEX>," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mobe</ENAMEX> tells <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ferd</ENAMEX>. "It seems the land controversy

					where a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">railway</ENAMEX> was being built, into reservations on far less
					desirable land.
				"Yes," replies <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferd</ENAMEX>, booting up the computer plans of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>
					they target for the rescue operation, "Signed on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Aug. 15, 1904</TIMEX>, with

				<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mobe</ENAMEX> asks, "Exactly what did the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Masai</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> received in exchange?
					As the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> have passed and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Masai</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> has grown (and more

				<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Radio Free Kenya</ENAMEX> presents a voice of protest: "We're now squatters on

					<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">informs M & F</ENAMEX> that, in moving onto the private land, "the

					destroyed the electrical fencing that rings the properties and driven
					their own <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">herds</ENAMEX> onto the land to graze." He tells them the area that

				A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Geographic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> on the coffee

				After the news programmes, they watch a televised debate. "Oh, no,"

				<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karen</ENAMEX>, representing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTO</ENAMEX> tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">interests</ENAMEX>, indicates that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kenya</ENAMEX>'s

				<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karen</ENAMEX> tells the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewers</ENAMEX>, "The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Masai</ENAMEX> have played an essential role in

					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">groups</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Masai</ENAMEX>, with their red tunics and traditional ways, are the

				But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Masai</ENAMEX>, who are among the poorest <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenyans</ENAMEX>, complain "We see

					that can be achieved with some training. . . . You would be making a

					You would be like a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who having found <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">copper</ENAMEX> gives up the desire

				"<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Showtime</ENAMEX>!" The plan is begun, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">04:15 hours</TIMEX>.

				Background: 
				As a young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johannes Brahms</ENAMEX> was a close <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Robert</ENAMEX> and
					<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Clara Schumann</ENAMEX>. They socialized publicly and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johannes</ENAMEX> was often in the
					Schumann <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX>. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Schumann</ENAMEX> died, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Johannes</ENAMEX> continued his
					friendship with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Clara</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Clara Schumann</ENAMEX>, herself a renowned <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pianist</ENAMEX>,
					gave concerts that showcased her late husbandÃ­s work to support
					herself and her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>. It is not known whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johannes</ENAMEX> had always
					loved <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Clara</ENAMEX> or if the affection sprang from the relationship that grew
					after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RobertÃ</ENAMEX>­s death. History does tell us that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brahms</ENAMEX> professed his
					love for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Clara</ENAMEX> though they never married.
				For more detailed biographies of each of these classical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">composers</ENAMEX>,
					refer to:
				
					<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johannes Brahms</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Schumann</ENAMEX>, by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Betty</ENAMEX>

				Â 
				<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Assignment Choices</ENAMEX>: 
				
				<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. Write a dialogue that might have taken place between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Clara</ENAMEX> and
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Johannes</ENAMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RobertÃ</ENAMEX>­s death. Begin the conversation with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brahms</ENAMEX>
					confessing to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Clara</ENAMEX> that he loves her. Use your imagination. Here are
					some questions to get you started thinking:
				- What might <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brahms</ENAMEX> say to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Clara</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> open up the subject of his
					love for her?
				- Does <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brahms</ENAMEX> propose marriage or is it he who never asks, rather
					than she who refuses?
				- What might have been ClaraÃ­s reasons for not marrying Johannes
					<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brahms</ENAMEX>? Was she still in love with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert</ENAMEX>? Did <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Clara</ENAMEX> fear that if she
					<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">married Brahms</ENAMEX> that it would be too awkward to continue concertizing
					with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RobertÃ</ENAMEX>­s <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pieces</ENAMEX>? Or was there some other reason she refused
					BrahmsÃ­ affection?
				
				<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. Write the lyrics for a song <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brahms</ENAMEX> might have written for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Clara</ENAMEX>.
					Keep in mind that words for songs during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this time</TIMEX> period usually
					<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rhymed</ENAMEX>.
				
				<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. If you play an instrument, create an original short piece that
					<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brahms</ENAMEX> might have written for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Clara</ENAMEX>. Consider the emotions of love and
					how they might be conveyed through the music. Would the tempo be slow
					and the tone sad because love is unrequited, or might the tempo be
					fast and furious to show the frustration of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">souls</ENAMEX> that never
					connect?
				
				As you begin these assignments, remember to keep in mind what was and
					was not Ã¬socially acceptableÃ® in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Johannes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ClaraÃ</ENAMEX>­s day.

				Voice over, through the radio in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>, on the television at the
					<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">airport</ENAMEX>, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ambulance</ENAMEX> waiting outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>, we hear part

				"If we unite now, each and every one of us, and each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tribe</ENAMEX> to
					another, we will cause the implementation in this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> of that
					which the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> calls democracy. True democracy has no colour
					distinction. It does not choose between black and white. We are here
					in this tremendous gathering under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K.A.U.</ENAMEX> flag to find which road
					leads us from darkness into democracy. In order to find it we <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Africans</ENAMEX>
					must first achieve the right to elect our own <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX>. That is
					surely the first principle of democracy. We are the only race in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kenya</ENAMEX>
					which does not elect its own <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legislature</ENAMEX> and we
					are going to set about to rectify this situation. We feel we are
					dominated by a handful of others who refuse to be just. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">God</ENAMEX> said this
					is our land. Land in which we are to flourish as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. We are not
					worried that other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">races</ENAMEX> are here with us in our <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, but we
					insist that we are the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> here, and what we want we insist we
					get. We want our <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cattle</ENAMEX> to get fat on our land so that our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
					grow up in prosperity; we do not want that fat removed to feed others.
					He who has ears should now hear that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K.A.U.</ENAMEX> claims this land as its
					own gift from God and I wish those who arc black, white or brown at
					this meeting to know this. . . .
				. . Bribery and corruption is prevalent in this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, but I am not
					surprised. As long as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are held down, corruption is sure to
					rise and the only answer to this is a policy of equality. If we work
					together as one, we must succeed.

				<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INITIATION</ENAMEX>
				<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OF BOYS AND GIRLS</ENAMEX>
				
				
					THE <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CUSTOM</ENAMEX> of clitoridectomy of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX>, which we
					are going to describe here, has been strongly attacked by a number of
					influential <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>-missionary, sentimental pro-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX>,
					government, educational and medical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX>. We think it necessary
					to give a short historical background of the method employed by these
					<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> in attacking the custom of clitoridectomy of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX>.
				
				[<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Here Jomo Kenyatta</ENAMEX>, political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kenya</ENAMEX>'s independence,
					describes the context in the integral <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Kikiyu</ENAMEX> culture of the custom of
					clitoridectomy of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> and other rituals surrounding it, as well as
					initiation ceremonies for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX>. He makes it clear that these customs
					functioned to make young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> part of community religious and social
					life and compares them to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">circumcision</ENAMEX>. He also makes plain the
					contemptuous-and contemptible-efforts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scottish Mission</ENAMEX> to
					destroy all "pagan" customs of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Kikyu</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>.]
				
				However, this urge for abolishing a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>'s social custom by force
					of law was not wholeheartedly accepted by the majority of the
					<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">delegates</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conference</ENAMEX>. General opinion was for education which
					would enable the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to choose what customs to keep and which ones
					they would like to get rid of.
				
				It should be pointed out here that there is a strong <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> of
					<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">educated Gikuyu</ENAMEX> opinion in defence of this custom. In the matrimonial
					<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">relation</ENAMEX>, the rite de passage [rite of passage]
					is the deciding factor. No proper <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Gikuyu</ENAMEX> would dream of marrying a
					<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> who has not been circumcised, and vice versa. It is taboo for a
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gikuyu</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> to have sexual relations with someone who has not
					undergone this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX>. If it happens, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> must go
					through a ceremonial purification, korutwo
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thahu</ENAMEX> or gotahikio megiro-namely, ritual
					vomiting of the evil deeds. A few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">detribalised</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gikuyu</ENAMEX>, while they are
					away from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">some years</TIMEX>, have thought fit to denounce the custom
					and to marry uncircumcised <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX>, especially from coastal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tribes</ENAMEX>,
					thinking that they could bring them back to their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fathers</ENAMEX>' homes
					without offending the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>. But to their surprise they found that
					their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fathers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brothers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sisters</ENAMEX>, following the tribal
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">custom</ENAMEX>, are not prepared to welcome as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relative</ENAMEX>-in-law anyone who
					has not fulfilled the ritual qualifications for matrimony. Therefore a
					problem has faced these semi-detribalised <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gikuyu</ENAMEX> when they wanted to
					return to their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">homeland</ENAMEX>. Their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> have demanded that if their
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sons</ENAMEX> wished to settle down and have the blessings of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> and
					the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clan</ENAMEX>, they must divorce the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> married outside the rigid tribal
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">custom</ENAMEX> and then marry a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> with the approved tribal qualifications.
					Failing this, they have been turned out and disinherited.
				
				[Some Aspects of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ceremonies</ENAMEX>]
				. . . .
				Late in the afternoon an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arch</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">banana</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sugar</ENAMEX>-canes is
					built at the entrance of the homestead of the matuumo . . . .To start the race a ceremonial horn is blown.
					At this point the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX>, who are not allowed to participate in the
					<ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">race</ENAMEX>, start out walking to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>, escorted by a group of senior
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">warriors</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> singing ritual and heroic songs. When the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> are
					near the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>, the ceremonial horn is again sounded, this time
					indicating that it is time for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> to start the race. The boys
					then start running in a great excitement, as though they were going to
					a battle. The truth is, it is really considered a sort of fight

					particular age-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. The one who reaches the tree <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> and throws
					his wooden spear over the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> is elected there and then as the leader
					and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> of the age-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> for life. It is believed that such
					a one is chosen by the will of the ancestral spirits in communication
					with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ngai</ENAMEX>, and is therefore highly respected.
				
				The mogumo ceremony occupies only a short
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>. As stated above, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> climb the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>, break the top
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">branches</ENAMEX>, while the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> collect leaves and twigs dropped on the
					ground. These are later tied into bunches and carried back to the
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homestead</ENAMEX> to keep the sacred fire burning the whole night and also to
					be used in other rituals, especially in making the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">initiates</ENAMEX>' beds.
					The songs rendered by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> round the foot of the
					tree generally pertain to sexual knowledge. This is to give the
					initiates an opportunity of acquainting themselves with all necessary
					rules and regulations governing social relationship between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and
					<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>.
				
				At the completion of kunna mogumo (breaking of
					the sacred <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>), the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> are lined up according to the
					order of their adoption. Here a ceremony of taking the tribal oath
						(<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">muuma wa anake</ENAMEX>) is conducted by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elders</ENAMEX>
					of the ceremonial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">council</ENAMEX>. The initiates promise by this oath that
					from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this day</TIMEX> onward they will in every respect deport themselves like
					<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> and take an responsibilities in the welfare of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX>,
					and that they will not lag behind whenever called upon to perform any
					service or duty in the protection and advancement of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tribe</ENAMEX> as a
					whole. Furthermore, they are made to promise never to reveal the
					tribal secrets, even to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tribe</ENAMEX> who has not yet been
					initiated.
				. . . . The songs they sing on the homeward march are directed
					towards denouncing all things that are not fit and proper for any
					adult <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX> to do. Moreover, the phrases embodied in
					these songs are to encourage the initiates to become worthy and
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">honourable</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the adult <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> into which they are to be
					graduated.
				. . . .
				At the end of the ceremony the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> are free to go to their
					respective <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> to rest until <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">next morning</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Care</ENAMEX> is taken to protect
					them from anything that might inflict wounds upon them, as the
					shedding of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> is regarded as an omen of ill luck. The initiates
					are guarded the whole <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> by senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">warriors</ENAMEX> against outside
					interference. In every home a ceremonial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> (mondo-mogo <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wa mambura</ENAMEX>) is assigned by the traditional council
						(<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">njama ya kirera</ENAMEX>) to protect the initiates
					against any possible attacks from witchcraft and also against any
					temptation or enticement to indulge in sexual intercourse.
				
				. . . .[ <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">After The Girl is Operated On</ENAMEX>]
				
				At the time of the surgical operation the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> hardly feels any pain
					for the simple reason that her limbs have been numbed, and the
					operation is over before she is conscious of it. It is only when she
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">awakes</ENAMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three or four hours</TIMEX> of rest that she begins to realize
					that something has been done to her genital organ. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> has
					learned this fact from several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX> and close <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>) who
					have gone through the initiation and who belong to the sane age-group
					with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX>.
				
				This signifies that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> have now been born again, not as the
					<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> of an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX>, but of the whole <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tribe</ENAMEX>. The initiates
					address one another as "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wanyu-Wakine</ENAMEX>," which
					means "My tribal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX>." When the ceremony is completed
					all burst into ritual song. They bid farewell to one another and then
					leave the homestead under the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">escort</ENAMEX> of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX>. On the
					arrival at their respective <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sheep</ENAMEX> or rat is killed by the
					<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> to welcome them <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> again and anoint them as new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of
					the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX> (koinokai na kohaka mwanake or
						moiretu maguta). At this ceremony the parents
					are provided with brass ear-rings, as a sign of seniority. This is
					done when the first-born is initiated.
				. . . .
				With such limited knowledge as they are able to acquire from their
					converts or from others, who invariably distort the reality of the
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">irua</ENAMEX> in order to please them, these same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">missionaries</ENAMEX> pose as
					<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> customs. How often have we not heard such
					<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> saying: "We have lived in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a number or years</TIMEX> and we
					know the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> mind well."? This, however, does not qualify them or
					entitle them to claim authority on sociological or anthropological
					questions. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> is in the best position properly to discuss and
					disclose the psychological background of tribal customs, such as irua, etc., and he should be given the
					opportunity to acquire the scientific training which will enable him
					to do so. This is a point which should be appreciated by well-meaning
					<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">anthropologists</ENAMEX> who have bad experience in the difficulties of
					<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">field</ENAMEX>-work in various parts of the world.

					Primeval
				After manfully squeezing his nose to unseat a particularly
					intractable blackhead, pressing the flesh to the tearful point where
					he was forced to consider that the incipient rosacea there might be
					making the rhynodermis too thick, tougher that it had been when he was
					quite frequently used to squeeze in his lubricated, more comedogenic
					<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youth</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ambrose Broussard</ENAMEX> pulled down his underwear, kicked when the
					briefs-as they always did-caught on his moccasins, and sat down on the
					toilet. His buttocks seemed to hurtle past their usual resting point
					and collided, with little padding to diminish the impact as his flesh
					had gone the way of lipodystrophy, with the cold white rim of the
					toilet. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> alone can easily neglect to lift the seat, although
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ambrose</ENAMEX> had recently replaced the unhygienic seat left behind by the
					previous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tenant</ENAMEX> with a pristine pink one which he thought made a
					whimsical match with the pink tiles on the bathroom walls, yet he'd
					never been moved to harmonize the blue color of the floor tiles,
					perhaps because he'd painted above the tile <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wainscoting</ENAMEX> in a
					semi-gloss aubergine he thought was a further inspired choice.
				When he hit the rim, he was pleased that he was able to ejaculate
					"Holy Shit!" within microseconds of contact, congratulating himself on
					the miniscule time-lapse between pain signals and an apposite
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rejoinder</ENAMEX>. Having feared just this kind of undignified clapping of
					tender skin onto the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">chilly</TIMEX> and narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">porcelain</ENAMEX>, he was wont to leave
					the seat down, until recently when it became redolently clear that
					tiny droplets of urine were deliquescing to burden the air with the
					fug of a public latrine. There was no completely agreeable solution
					except permanent vigilance.
				In any case, after replacing the seat and spreading his anal pore,
					his disappointment at the quantity and texture of the waste he pushed
					out was mollified only when a very organized plume of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> was emitted,
					followed by a much more gratifying, elongated extrusion of shit and a
					final firm fart that enabled the distended belly to regain some
					smoother roundness. The unhindered egress of his excreta permitted
					Ambrose a moment of reflection regarding the toilet as the biological
					altar where-not unlike the deep connection with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nature</ENAMEX> inherited from
					his <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Native American</ENAMEX> forebears--through autonomic muscular contractions
					and flexions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX>, one performed the ritual of self-worship
					in which the very alimentary-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eliminative</NUMEX> tubular configuration of the
					human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> was experienced most to resemble that of other
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>--fundamentally. In fact, the coincidence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> adverb
					connoting radical excavation of the underlying ground of animal life
					with the noun denoting the bottom part of the human body-not counting
					the lower extremities-entered his mind, spiced with a mild frisson of
					pride at the "primitive" adaptation that efficaciously coordinated
					involuntary peristaltic motion and voluntary bearing down and pushing
					to achieve evacuation. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sensation</ENAMEX> of clean unopposed extrusion,
					along with the bombast of flatulence and the highly parabolic
					presentation of urine through the manually guided penis, was
					pleasurable in the extreme, wreathed with smells that one could not
					deny were olfactory tokens of life, of healthy inward- and out-ness,
					although only one's own could be granted this status and exempted from
					the general disgust others' bodily excrescences could awaken in one if
					they originated from any of the rest of us. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ambrose</ENAMEX> had, like many
					<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">warriors</ENAMEX> of the spirit, had occasion to taste this matter, but his
					<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">palate</ENAMEX> rejected the ugly bitter flavor-so surprisingly, intolerably,
					different from its fetid and rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">olorousness</ENAMEX>--and he concluded that,
					despite the alluring abjection it most theatrically might otherwise
					offer, coprophagia would never be his choice at the banquet table of
					infantile sexual fixations.
				Meditating on the high estimation <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pascal</ENAMEX> placed on frequent and
					copious defecation, enjoying especially the more vernacular version of
					the triadic encomium to "good shoes, . . ?., and a warm place to shit"
					(what was that other priority he couldn't remember?), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ambrose</ENAMEX> turned
					his attention to more rigorous exigencies of the present situation.
					That is, he remembered he was entrusted by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Humpback</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Himself</ENAMEX> to
					bring in the suspicious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oedipa</ENAMEX> for testing. Hopping over the cold
					<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tiles</ENAMEX>, disregarding
				creeping neuropathic foot pain, attributable once again to what were
					<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">blithely</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medication</ENAMEX> side-effects, he therefore gave himself a
					shake, eschewed a wipe, preferring the prospect of a warm lavage, and
					turned on the shower, lighting a cigarette to enhance the waiting time
					while the hot water made its way from the distant heater to his
					<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bathroom</ENAMEX>. When all was right, he tossed his butt into the toilet and
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lathered</ENAMEX> and scrubbed.
				<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ambrose Broussard</ENAMEX> knew about what were called "<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-spirited" among
					the anthropological <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">queers</ENAMEX> who wanted to authenticate their own
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proclivities</ENAMEX> and choices, and he felt a strong antipathy at the
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prospect</ENAMEX> of eliminating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oedipa</ENAMEX>. Moreover, his early support for his
					sworn blood-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Venison</ENAMEX>'s visionary schemes had diminished sharply
					in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last several months</TIMEX> as the white-turbaned flocks of converts
					increased and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ven</ENAMEX> took on the vocal tones of incipient madness.
					Ambrose stalked out to his <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicle</ENAMEX>, a feul-<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> equipped hybrid
					Hummer, roared to the edge of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">compound</ENAMEX>, and swept <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oedipa</ENAMEX> away with
					<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> to spare before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fruit of the Sea</ENAMEX> armed security arrived.
				"What the fuck are you doing?" <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">demanded Oedipa</ENAMEX>. "Let me out of here!"
				"The Killers are coming for you, and me too now that I'm running with
					you. We'll ditch this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Big Two-Hearted River</ENAMEX>. We'll go into

				Chapter <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">49</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nick</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atala</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rene</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ambrose</ENAMEX> and ?
				
				"The Killers are coming for you, and me too now that I'm running with
					you, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ambrose</ENAMEX> told <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oedipa</ENAMEX>. "We'll ditch this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Big Two-Hearted</ENAMEX>
					River. We'll go into the woods and walk to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Seney</ENAMEX>, hop the train
					there."
				"That's ridiculous," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oedipa</ENAMEX> shot back. "What Killers? What for? And
					there is no train any more."
				"I mean we'll drive to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Seney</ENAMEX>, through <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Blaney Park</ENAMEX>, and ditch the car
					at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seney</ENAMEX>. That's what I mean."
				"What are you talking about? I don't know you, and I'm not going with

				"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Look</ENAMEX>, don't go all ignorant on me. I'm <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ambrose</ENAMEX>. The Killers are
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Venison</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fruit of the Sea</ENAMEX>. They're after you."
				"Why would they be after me?" <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oedipa</ENAMEX> asked.
				"Yeah, I wonder," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ambrose</ENAMEX> was getting impatient. "They might want to
					check out a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Sirenia</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">disciple</ENAMEX> who wasn't what she said she was?"
				When there was no answer to that, he asked, "Just who are you,
					anyway? You're really a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX>, eh?"
				"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">No</ENAMEX>!" she retorted. "What's it to you, anyway<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">?</ENAMEX>"
				"I'm sick of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Venison</ENAMEX> and I'm saving your ass. That's what's it to

				They said nothing more until they stopped for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> at the stoplight
					in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germfask</ENAMEX>.
				
				<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">49</TIMEX> The Killers

					down at the counter.
				"What's yours?" <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George</ENAMEX> asked them.
				"I don't know," one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> said. "What do you want to eat, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al</ENAMEX>?"
				"I don't know," said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al.</ENAMEX> "I don't know what I want to eat."
				Outside it was getting dark. The streetlight came on outside the
					window. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> at the counter read the menu. From the other end
					of the counter <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ambrose Broussard</ENAMEX> watched them. He had been waiting for
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oedipa</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bathroom</ENAMEX>.
				"Fuck it, give us <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> fried egg <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sandwiches</ENAMEX> to go. We gotta go, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Al.</ENAMEX>"
				"Fuck it, ok, but I want fries."
				"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Two fries</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> fried egg <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sandwiches</ENAMEX>, right?" <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George</ENAMEX> asked.
				"Say, you're a pretty bright boy, eh? Yeah. And hurry up. We gotta
					get to Manistique fast."
				<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Al</ENAMEX> lit a cigarette. "Give me a cup of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX> now though, "he said. He
					turned toward <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ambrose</ENAMEX>. "What's up, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chief</ENAMEX>?" he asked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ambrose</ENAMEX>.
				"Nothing," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ambrose</ENAMEX> picked up his mug and swallowed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX>, It was too
					hot but he swallowed anyway. He could feel it burning all the way
					down.
				"That's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">twenty</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>," said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George</ENAMEX>, wrapping the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sandwiches</ENAMEX> in
					waxed paper. "Plus <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty five</TIMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-fifty."
				The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> turned back to look at the paper bag of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sandwiches</ENAMEX>. "You got
					<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">quarters</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al</ENAMEX>?"
				<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Al</ENAMEX> paid and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> left. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oedipa</ENAMEX> came out from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bathroom</ENAMEX>, behind
					the counter opposite the door. She sat on the stool next to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ambrose</ENAMEX>.
				"Don't look now, don't turn around. Those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> are The Killers,"
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ambrose</ENAMEX> said. "We're lucky, they're <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> and don't know me. I
					bet they know what you look like, though."
				She took their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sandwiches</ENAMEX> across to a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">booth</ENAMEX>. She motioned
					for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ambrose</ENAMEX> to sit on the same side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">booth</ENAMEX>, to make it more
					difficult for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George</ENAMEX> the counterman to overhear.
				"OK, um, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ambrose</ENAMEX>," she said. Here's the deal. So, they're after me,
					I've gotta get to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sault Ste. Marie</ENAMEX> and across to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>. I'll pay you
					to drive me there."
				"Nope, no, no <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Soo</ENAMEX>. I've got a powerboat in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Deer Park</ENAMEX>. We'll go across
					the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lake</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Batchawana Bay</ENAMEX>. And you'll pay, all right."
				"Whatever you want." She dropped her spoon into her <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX>. "Can we
					leave now?"
				As they walked along the road to where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hummer</ENAMEX> was hidden, Ambrose
					pursued his questions. "Start by getting real with me. No forked
					tongue with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX>!"
				Oedipa sighed, cleared her throat and began. "Get in, start the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>.
					I'll be right there."
				As the engine turned over, the passenger door opened. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ambrose</ENAMEX> barely
					turned to see her. Then he heard a startling new voice. "This is real.
					The real is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Achmed Oedipus bin Maas</ENAMEX>. I was sent here to stop <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sirenia</ENAMEX>.
					In my laptop here is enough to send <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Venison</ENAMEX>-and you, if you're not
					straight with me-to hell."
				"<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hey</ENAMEX>, no need for threats, ok." I'm here, right, saving your ass? I'm

				"No, I'm saving your ass. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Deer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Park</ENAMEX> is out; they already know you'd

					intrigue. Among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">male</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> female <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> black-footed
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">penguins</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">aquarium</ENAMEX>'s exhibit, tales of love, lust and betrayal
					are the norm. These <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mate</ENAMEX> for life. But given the
					disproportionate male-female ratio at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">aquarium</ENAMEX>, some of the
					<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females flirt</ENAMEX> profusely and dump their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> for single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> with
					better nests.
				
				<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wendell</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cass</ENAMEX>, however, take no part in these cunning schemes.
					They have been completely devoted to each other for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the last eight</TIMEX>
					<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>. In fact, neither one of them has ever been with anyone else,
					says their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">keeper</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephanie Mitchell</ENAMEX>.
				
				But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partnership</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wendell</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cass</ENAMEX> adds drama in another way.
					They're both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">male</ENAMEX>. That is to say, they're gay penguins.
				
				This is not unusual. "There are a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> that have same-sex
					relations, it's just that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> don't know about it," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitchell</ENAMEX> said.
					"I mean, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe Schmoe</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> is not someone who's read all sorts
					of biology books."
				
				One particular book is helpful in this case. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce Bagemihl</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Biological Exuberance</ENAMEX>,87
					published in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>, documents homosexual behavior in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 450</NUMEX>
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal species</ENAMEX>. The list includes grizzly <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bears</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">gorillas</ENAMEX>, flamingos,
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">owls</ENAMEX> and even several species of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salmon</ENAMEX>.
				
				"The world is, indeed, teeming with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homosexual</ENAMEX>, bisexual and
					transgendered <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">creatures</ENAMEX> of every stripe and feather," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bagemihl</ENAMEX> writes
					in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">page</ENAMEX> of his book. "From the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southeastern Blueberry Bee of</ENAMEX>
					the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 130</NUMEX> different <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bird species worldwide</ENAMEX>,
					the 'birds and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX>,' literally, are queer."
				
				In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>, it's the penguins.
				
				At the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Central Park Zoo</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Silo</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roy</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">male</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chinstrap</ENAMEX> penguins,
					have been in an exclusive relationship for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four years</TIMEX>. Last mating
					season, they even fostered an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">egg</ENAMEX> together.
				
				"They got all excited when we gave them the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">egg</ENAMEX>," said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rob Gramzay</ENAMEX>,
					senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">keeper</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">polar birds</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">zoo</ENAMEX>. He took the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">egg</ENAMEX> from a
					young, inexperienced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> that hatched an extra and gave it to Silo
					and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roy</ENAMEX>. "And they did a really great job of taking care of the chick
					and feeding it."
				
				Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">53</NUMEX> penguins in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Central Park Zoo</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Silo and Roy</ENAMEX> are not the
					only ones that are gay. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> pairs of homosexual
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">penguins</ENAMEX>. In an effort to increase breeding, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">zookeepers</ENAMEX> tried to
					separate them by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX>. They failed, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gramzay</ENAMEX>.88

				Elsewhere, a female ape wraps her legs around another
					female, "rubbing her own clitoris against her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX>'s while emitting
					screams of enjoyment." The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researcher</ENAMEX> explains: It's a form of
					greeting behavior. Or reconciliation. Possibly food-exchange behavior.
					It's certainly not sex. Not lesbian sex. Not hot lesbian sex.
				
				<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Six</NUMEX> bighorn rams cluster, rubbing, nuzzling and mounting
					each other. "Aggressosexual behavior," the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biologist</ENAMEX> explains. A way
					of establishing dominance.
				
				They've been keeping it from us: There are homosexual
					and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bisexual animals</ENAMEX>, ranging from charismatic megafauna like mountain
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">gorillas</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guinea pigs</ENAMEX>. There are transgendered
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, transvestite <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> (who adopt the behavior of the other
					gender but don't have sex with their own), and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> who live in
					bisexual triads and quartets.
				
				<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce Bagemihl</ENAMEX> spent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 years</TIMEX> scouring the biological literature for
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> on alternative sexuality in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> to write <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Biological Exuberance: Animal Homosexuality and Natural</ENAMEX>
					Diversity, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">768</NUMEX> pages about exactly what goes on at "<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Park</ENAMEX>'s"
					Big <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gay Al</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Big Gay Animal Sanctuary</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> section discusses
					animal sexuality in its many forms and the ways <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biologists</ENAMEX> have tried
					to explain it away. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> section, "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A Wondrous Bestiary</ENAMEX>,"
					describes unconventional sexuality in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly 200</NUMEX> mammals and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> --
					orangutans, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">whales</ENAMEX>, warthogs, fruit bats, chaffinches<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.89</NUMEX>

				It is a fundamental <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Darwinian</ENAMEX> principle that traits and behaviours
					cannot spread over evolutionary time if they reduce an individual's
					personal reproductive success. To be more precise, an imaginary
					species consisting only of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> with an exclusive and life-long
					<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homosexual behaviour</ENAMEX> will be extinct in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX>.
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parthenogenetic</ENAMEX> (virgin birth) species do exist in nature, they
					consist of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX>, but a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> homosexual <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> has never been
					found. Such a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> cannot exist. Just as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sterile species</ENAMEX> cannot
					exist. What does exist in nature are <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">up to 10 percent</NUMEX> of
					<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homosexuals</ENAMEX>, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bagemihl</ENAMEX>. But even this is a puzzle. If
					those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> do not reproduce, evolution theory predicts that the
					percentage in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> must decrease continuously down to a
					level that is produced by new mutations. But we observe more than
					that. So how should the excess be explained? <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> possibility is
					bisexuality, the combination of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homosexual</ENAMEX> and heterosexual behaviour
					in the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX>. But this cannot be the answer either, because
					bisexual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> will produce on average less progeny than
					full-time heterosexuals. So the existence is still unexplained.
					Bagemihl skilfully demolishes a variety of explanations for
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homosexuality</ENAMEX> proposed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biologists</ENAMEX>. This is one of the best, and
					interesting parts of his book. Probably few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have the
					encyclopaedic knowledge of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homosexual behaviour</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> to be able
					to refute the variety of hypotheses to explain (away) homosexuality.
					In the end <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bagemihl</ENAMEX> concludes, somewhat surprisingly, that
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homosexuality</ENAMEX> has no function, it just is.
					<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Homosexual behaviour</ENAMEX> has an intrinsic value<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.90</NUMEX>
				
				<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">51 Can I Get A Witness</ENAMEX>
				(<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nov Kenya Times</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Witnesses</ENAMEX> say the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> levitated up
					toward the ceiling, 'Her knees were bent upwards, her legs still
					spread apart, her arms falling limp behind her, as the sterile drape
					slipped off and slithered to the floor,' reported a surgical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurse</ENAMEX>. "I
					didn't have the opportunity to make my ritual incision," commented
					Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adowe Kikuyu</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clan leader</ENAMEX> and indigenous medicine practitioner.
					"Suddenly, the ceiling parted and she went to heaven," her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aunt</ENAMEX> said,
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sobbing</ENAMEX>. "It was a miracle-God called her to prevent my niece from
					going under the knife in that godless custom. I don't know what my

				<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cyril</ENAMEX> put down the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kenya</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> and chortled a
					little in his glee. "Well, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vyv</ENAMEX>," he said, "we've done it. By now
					she'll be in the air heading to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> and on her way to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hotel Real</ENAMEX>
					Desert."
				"<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Caprice Sithole</ENAMEX> will make sure she's all right," added <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vyvyan</ENAMEX>. "And
					it's time we got back there too. I hope the little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX> is still
					alive, as we can be very helpful to her now, I think."
				What a happy reunion they all made back at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hotel</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Caprice</ENAMEX>
					prepared a magnificent meal of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegan blood</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less</NUMEX> black <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pudding</ENAMEX>, which
					their new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guest</ENAMEX> found acceptable but odd, and all toasted to success.
				<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cy</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vyv</ENAMEX> spent <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an hour</TIMEX> before dinner conferring with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MonaLisa</ENAMEX> and
					Novy, who appeared much assured by the conversation. Timmy, relieved
					to be home, shouted "God bless us, every one!"
				But not everyone was as blessed as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Timmy</ENAMEX> might have wished. He
					learned that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herr Siegfried</ENAMEX> was still missing, presumably in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>
					somewhere, and as for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph</ENAMEX>, well , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph</ENAMEX> had been unmasked as an
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">impostor</ENAMEX> just after leaving <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dubai</ENAMEX>. Apparently, an operative of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World</ENAMEX>
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Security Operations</ENAMEX> had been transformed through complicated cosmetic
					surgery and planted to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spy</ENAMEX> on them all,.
				<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vyvyan</ENAMEX> said tartly, "He was discovered when he was found to have no
					recollection of the chord changes in 'Sophisticated <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lady</ENAMEX>.' The bad

				"No, I'm afraid not," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neddy</ENAMEX> interjected. "Look at this news from
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fox-Europe</ENAMEX>."
				There on the television was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph</ENAMEX>, manacled, his legs in shackles,
					being led off an airplane in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Illinois</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Attorney General</ENAMEX>
					was then shown announcing that a long-time <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fugitive</ENAMEX>, undoubtedly
					connected with international terrorism, had been caught and extradited
					back to face murder charges in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AG</ENAMEX> thanked Mr. (formerly
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colonel</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oliver South</ENAMEX> for his work in apprehending "this white-hating,
					<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cop</ENAMEX>-maiming monster."
				The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BBC</ENAMEX> featured <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kenya</ENAMEX> news as well. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">winner</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Nobel Peace</ENAMEX>

					"founded an <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Africa</ENAMEX>-wide movement that empowered <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, confronted

					"Never mind that she thinks <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> is a man-made plague to kill
					<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Africans</ENAMEX>," sneered <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Caprice</ENAMEX>. "Sadly, she's right for all the wrong

				"<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mama</ENAMEX>," her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Xoliswa</ENAMEX> cried. "It's because of the history of

				"<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ugh</ENAMEX>," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neddy</ENAMEX> grunted. "My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">uncle</ENAMEX> was a Reverend, but he would never

				"<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affairs</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Zimbabwe</ENAMEX> are our task, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Neddy</ENAMEX>, not the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>'s. They

				The feds are spying on Ã± and harassing Ã± political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activists</ENAMEX> with a
					fury not seen since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s</TIMEX>.
				
				<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EARLY THIS MONTH</TIMEX> the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> launched the latest crude
					offensive in its so-called war on terror. Titled the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX> Plan, the
					program called for "aggressive Ã± even obvious Ã± surveillance" of a
					wide range of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> (regardless of whether or not they're
					suspected of any criminal wrongdoing) until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Nov. 2</TIMEX> presidential
					election, according to an internal document leaked to the press.
				
				The plan Ã± a collaboration between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Bureau of</ENAMEX>
					Investigation, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Immigration and Customs Enforcement</ENAMEX>, and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>
					Ã± involves renewed scrutiny of mosques and interrogations of people
					whose national origin, religious faith, or political leanings might,
					in the eyes of the feds, indicate even the most far-flung relationship
					to "terrorism."
				
				<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Immigrants</ENAMEX> and others interviewed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> have been "questioned
					about immigration status Ã± theirs and others' Ã± and about their
					political and religious views," the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Lawyers Guild</ENAMEX>'s Stacey
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tolchin</ENAMEX> said at an emergency press conference called by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">San</ENAMEX>
					<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francisco</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee</ENAMEX>,
					the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bay Area Association of Muslim Lawyers</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NLG</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
					Civil <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Liberties Union</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Northern California</ENAMEX>.
				
				For <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staffers</ENAMEX> at these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>, responding to these kinds of
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">crackdowns</ENAMEX> has become alarmingly routine. This is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX> round of
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> "informal interviews" targeting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX> based on their national
					<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">origin</ENAMEX>, religion, and, increasingly, their political views.
				
				No one knows just how many have been deported as a result of the
					interviews or of the various dragnets conducted over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past three</TIMEX>
					<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>. Local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NLG</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nancy Hormachae</ENAMEX> reported that at least
					<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> were forced into deportation hearings as the result of
					the notorious Special <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Registration program</ENAMEX> alone. And the fact that
					none of these campaigns has proffered a single <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">al-Qaeda</ENAMEX> operative
					hasn't deterred the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> a bit.
				
				So far, immigrant <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslims</ENAMEX> and those from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Middle East</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central</ENAMEX>
					<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX> have suffered the brunt of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>'s attacks on
					civil liberties. But as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NLG</ENAMEX> immigration <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark Van Der Hout</ENAMEX>
					told me, "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Going</ENAMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX> is just the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step towards going
					after <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX>."
				
				Indeed, a look at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past three years</TIMEX> shows that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Attorney General</ENAMEX>
					<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Ashcroft</ENAMEX>'s offensive has widened to include a range of citizens
					whose only real crime is their opposition to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>'s
					policies.
				
				The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> comes calling
				
				<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George W. Bush</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Aschroft</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> have made it easier
					to spy on everyday <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> without probable cause of criminal
					activity, even allowing for the indefinite detention of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Americans</ENAMEX>
					dubbed "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enemy combatants</ENAMEX>," without charges or access to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX>.
					They've eviscerated laws meant to keep a wall between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> and the
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> and erected an extensive domestic-spying infrastructure, enlisting
					private <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> and relying on private industry to a degree never
					seen before. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> are maintaining a grand total of
					<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> domestic watch lists.
				
				The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> has shifted federal funding away from
					traditional law enforcement and toward domestic spying, explained <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John</ENAMEX>
					<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Crew</ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACLU</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Northern California</ENAMEX> specializing in
					<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> practices and surveillance issues. "A lot of this activity is,
					in fact, being carried out by local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> working with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joint</ENAMEX>
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Terrorism Task Force</ENAMEX>," he told me, explaining that those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> are
					considered "federalized." They report to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>. Local city officials
					Ã± even local police <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chiefs Ã±</ENAMEX> are often not aware of what these
					"special <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX>" are doing.
				
				As the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> loosened professional standards for law
					enforcement, it simultaneously increased financial incentives for
					conducting surveillance, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Crew</ENAMEX> continued. "To qualify for grants,
					[local law enforcement] must have <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> in their locale that
					are threats," he said. "They have to justify their own budget by
					amplifying the threat factor."
				
				[. . . . . elision of many examples of spying on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activists</ENAMEX>]
				
				Civil liberties watchdog <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> obviously worry about the chilling
					effect these kinds of surveillance and crackdowns have on our
					<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">faltering First and Fourth Amendments</ENAMEX>. But they also insist that
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ashcroft</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>'s approach isn't making us any safer.
				
				When law enforcement fails to distinguish between violent criminal
					activity and legitimate dissent Ã± and when it favors collecting as
					much information on as many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> as possible rather than useful
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intelligence</ENAMEX> resulting from bona fide criminal investigations Ã± it's
					"choosing quantity over quality," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Crew</ENAMEX> said. "You develop good leads
					by generating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">trust</ENAMEX>, not by disrespecting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>'s rights.... [And] if
					you're looking for a needle in a haystack, adding more <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">hay</ENAMEX> doesn't
					help any."
				
				The bills that have recently passed through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> in
					response to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">9-11 Commission</ENAMEX>'s findings, reorganizing intelligence
					gathering and expanding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Brother</ENAMEX>'s reach even further into our
					everyday lives, just promise more of the same.
				
				"It's during times of fear when civil liberties are most at risk,"
					<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Crew</ENAMEX> said.

				We are asking the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecutor</ENAMEX> to launch an investigation: since

				<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Achmed</ENAMEX> grabbed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ambrose</ENAMEX> at the shoulder of his coat and pulled so that
					they were sitting very close together, each able to look over the
					other's shoulder to monitor any approach. "We're here, " he whispered.
					"No unnecessary moves or sounds, ok? Handguns only, although I don't
					think we'll need them."
				"So what do we do now?" <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ambrose</ENAMEX> asked. "We've had no lights, no radio
					or cel contact, and silence for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the last three hours</TIMEX>.
				"Yeah, pretty peaceful, eh?" He pulled off his watch and told
					Ambrose, "Make sure everything is turned off, no electronics, no
					metal, no <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plastic</ENAMEX>, no nothing."
				<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Achmed</ENAMEX> made a pile of all their gear, and led them <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 10 meters</NUMEX>
					closer toward the lake. He started to take off his left boot and
					whispered to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ambrose</ENAMEX>, Take off all your clothes; strip down, nude,
					nothing., Just lie back with your arms open."
				<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ambrose</ENAMEX> did what he was told, but "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Damn</ENAMEX>," he thought; "danger is a
					turn-on, but I am not going to let this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> fuck me out here-on the
					run, get my ass froze off or shot off."
				"Don't think about it, just do it," he was told. "It's snowing, it's
					getting dark, and it's the only way we can get picked up by the infra
					red sensors."
				Not even <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a minute</TIMEX> later tracer <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bullets</ENAMEX> flew over them, streaking
					toward the lake in the thickening snowfall.
				"Don't get up," as if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ambrose</ENAMEX> wouldn't think of getting up, but it
					did cross his mind to raise his head and steal a look at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Achmed</ENAMEX>, just
					to check on what kind of toolkit the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> was operating with.
				<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Achmed</ENAMEX> yelled now over the gunfire. and there came the very welcome
					sound of a camo-white <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Kiowa OH-58D91</ENAMEX>, lobbing
					<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rockets</ENAMEX> into the treeline as it swooped down between the unseen
					<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pursuers</ENAMEX> and our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heroes</ENAMEX> A & <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A.</ENAMEX>
				In a matter of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">seconds</TIMEX>, somebody had bundled up the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> naked <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and
					strapped them into the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">helicopter</ENAMEX>. As they rose and headed out north
					over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lake</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Superior</ENAMEX>, a parting round of rocket fire threw a humvee into
					the air behind them, its occupants catapulted up flaming and then down
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hissing</ENAMEX> in the snow.
				On <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kiowa</ENAMEX>, a female in what was obviously flight gear but
					exhibiting no identification, wrapped <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Achmed</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ambrose</ENAMEX> in thermal
					blankets and started iv drips to rehydrate them, pushing in a dose of
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ativan</ENAMEX> to calm frayed nerves, but instructing them to be conscious of
					<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">long</ENAMEX>, slow breaths. Satisfied with their vital signs, she left them to
					drift a while; both were quiet for what seemed to be quite a long
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>, until the same female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reappeared</ENAMEX> with a clipboard and a cel
					phone.
				"Printed here is a timetable I am instructed to share with you. It
					details certain activities by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> you are acquainted with or that
					you will otherwise find relevant. The phone is programmed to put you
					in touch with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> who contracted for this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX>. They are
					waiting to speak with you." Ambrose was surprised when she handed the
					phone to him.
				When he pushed the talk button and heard a voice say his name,
					Ambrose was surprised again. He was talking not to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Venison</ENAMEX>, whom he
					had expected to hear gloating after re-capturing them. Instead the
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">voice</ENAMEX> seemed <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> and cheerful. "Well, well, " it said, "good
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indian</ENAMEX>. I expect you wonder what has happened, and who we are who are
					whisking you away."
				"Yes, I am, " answered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ambrose</ENAMEX>. "I gather you are on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Achmed</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX>,"
					he said, looking over at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who had turned the tables on him,
					switch-hitting; <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> a damsel in distress <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ambrose</ENAMEX> was saving from
					Sirenia, now a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> with powerful connections who turned around and
					<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">saved Ambrose</ENAMEX>.
				"Yes, you could say that, " said the voice on the phone. "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Achmed</ENAMEX> is a
					highly-skilled and very valuable asset to our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX>. You could say he's
					the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Beckham</ENAMEX> of the gender expression <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX>."
				"<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ok</ENAMEX>, I guess. I don't know who that is, and I don't know who you are.
					What is going on here? Where are we going?"
				"My name is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vyvyan</ENAMEX>. I'm going to leave it to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Achmed</ENAMEX> to answer most of
					those questions. For now, I'll just say congratulations on your
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resourcefulness</ENAMEX>. You are safe now, in good hands I promise you. And
					you are going, after a few stops, to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Argentina</ENAMEX>. It's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> there now,
					so I expect you'll enjoy it. Now will you please give the phone to
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Achmed</ENAMEX>? Cheerio!"
				From a hotel <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Torquay</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vyvyan</ENAMEX> spoke to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Achmed</ENAMEX> while <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cyril</ENAMEX> read

				"<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hey</ENAMEX>, what's he doing there? Go back, get that white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> out of the

					<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>? Yes, well, we've rented this stand for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next two days</TIMEX>.
					You'll have to eat somewhere else." He reports back to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX>,

				The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who was moved out of the food <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stall</ENAMEX> takes his bowl and moves

					Although deemed undesirable by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stonehenge</ENAMEX>, he is important to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX>

					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">products</ENAMEX>) for dominance, each with the aim to manipulate the other
					with the most subtle and insulting deviousness. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malaysia</ENAMEX> has a complex
					history of conflict where the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Malaysian Chinese</ENAMEX> have suffered the
					xenophobic odium of native <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Malays</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Malays</ENAMEX> have resisted the

				Lemmy, who is nominally a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultant</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sirenia</ENAMEX>, has chafed at the

					<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> female <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Sirenians</ENAMEX> were attempting to finalize a deal in which they

					<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Malaysian</ENAMEX> law and international protocols on the preservation of
					endangered <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX>, allegedly orphaned in the wild
					although undoubtedly from its only remaining habitats around Gunung
					<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Kinabulu Park</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sabah</ENAMEX>. was to be paid for in ringgits, the local

					(<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.80</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ringgits</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1 US dollar</NUMEX>) is now offering to deliver the "big
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fishie</ENAMEX>."
				
				Hahathir: "Dear mystical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>, we understand that some
					unscrupulous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> can
				be persuaded to bring this <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">magnificent beast</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dock</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KL</ENAMEX> for a
					mere <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4.5 million</NUMEX>," he says smiling, offering exquisite oolong <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> to
					his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guests</ENAMEX>.
				The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> shake their white turbans to say no, but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lemmy</ENAMEX> accepts.
				Lemmy: "How can we trust these unspeakable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">criminals</ENAMEX> to assure us the
					animal is
				healthy<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">?</ENAMEX>"
				<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX>: "Oh, our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert veterinary staff</ENAMEX> will of course be on available to
					you for a thorough
				examination. And for a nominal cost, we can even find <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shippers</ENAMEX> who
					will cross the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific</ENAMEX> and bring it directly to a port on the West
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coast</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX>. "
				He hands Lemmy a tiny cup carved of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rhino horn</ENAMEX>, containing a barely
					lip-moistening droplet of the rarest <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> in the world. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lemmy</ENAMEX> takes the
					cup but refuses the powdered opium Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hahathir</ENAMEX> offers to scoop into
					his cup with a repellently long fingernail on his pinky.
				<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>: "Of course, a sound animal will require very special treatment en

				<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sirenians</ENAMEX>, who have been expecting this ploy regarding
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trans</ENAMEX>-oceanic shipment, hastens to say,
				Sirenian: "Oh no, honored <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> of the eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">sea</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dragons</ENAMEX>, we will
					undertake the
				shipping. It's safer for us."
				A palpable chill passes through the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> at this maladroit refusal.
					Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hahathir</ENAMEX>, turning to his teapot, sighs,
				<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX>: "I cannot countenance the remotest possibility that you and your
					cargo might undergo
				risk from the notorious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pirates</ENAMEX> because of our negligence. Despite
					the risks a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreigner</ENAMEX> might face, we were prepared to make certain the

				Script notes by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quentin Quiet-</ENAMEX>noted treatment development <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> for
					Mirromax Films
				What is most visible here is the severely narrowed operational scope
					of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sirenians</ENAMEX>, who suffer from too much early viewing of films
					depicting <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wily Oriental Gentlemen</ENAMEX> (viz, the
					origin in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> colonialism of this term).
				Suffice it, for the plot, to say that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sirenians</ENAMEX> greedily offer up
					to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">US$ 2 million</NUMEX>, knowing that a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">conglomerate</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dentists</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Marin</ENAMEX>
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">County</ENAMEX> will pay <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> to see the live dugong swimming in the tank of

					Your <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">LIFE Story</ENAMEX> by someone else) determined to protect her heritage,
					will interfere with their plans.
				This script could be a smash: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Criticality</ENAMEX> meets <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ironic Distance</ENAMEX> meets

				How delightful to have yours of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX> last. And how is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Siegfried</ENAMEX>
					taking your new liason? During the meeting of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International</ENAMEX>
					Movement for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zion</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">last night</TIMEX>, I was reminded of you. Someone mentioned
					Husserl, who, I had forgotten, was himself a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jew</ENAMEX> but got himself
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">baptized</ENAMEX>. I searched <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ideen</ENAMEX> and wrote this in
					reaction:
				The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">I-Beam</ENAMEX>
				Husserl rightly points out that we are able to slide up and down the
					pole of the ego-<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">beam</ENAMEX> at will, moving now toward the thing, now away
					from it to consider the act of knowing and its modalities. For
					example, noematically I can consider a certain <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> who probably
					exists, but then I can turn back noetically to assess the degree of
					certitude that characterizes my consideration of that selfsame <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> as
					existing (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"># 105</NUMEX>). Now if we were to slide down to the point where all
					modalities are behind us on the noetic side of the pole, and if there
					we were to face the object, we would get the pure sense of the object
					in which its unity is given.
				My best to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosa von Praunheim</ENAMEX>, that butch thing!

				In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Islington</ENAMEX>, on a rainy <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cyril, Vyvyan</ENAMEX> and
					Ambrose emerge from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cinema</ENAMEX>, commenting on their disappointment
					with What the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bleep</ENAMEX>.
					
						99
					
				
				"That film100 is nothing, dear <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX>," says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cyril</ENAMEX>,
					"but an infomercial for a particular type of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX> thought, which
					has seized on quantum <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mechanics</ENAMEX> as an explanation for their
					theological <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> with consciousness and the desire to shed "the
					ego" in order to be at home in the new construal of the universe."
				Willing to play the interlocutor (not unlike <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Alda</ENAMEX> in science
					programs on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> public television), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ambrose</ENAMEX> asks, "but don't you agree
					that matter is no longer to be thought of as solid and stable, and
					that energy is what makes the universe?"
				"Let's start more simply, " ripostes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cyril</ENAMEX>. "The film's expert-a
					chiropractor, so he undoubtedly has the scientific background to
					comment on this-tells us that functional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MRIs</ENAMEX> show the same areas of
					the brain are active when looking at, say, an apple as when
					remembering an apple. He then says this indicates that the brain
					cannot tell the difference between what is real and what is only
					remembered. Therefore consciousness is constituting reality. That's
					just bad science!"
				<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vyvyan</ENAMEX> sees his point: "<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX> of all, the fMRI is not precise enough
					to show that the very same neurons are active in both cases. . And
					here's the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>. Mind your umbrellas!
				"<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Second</ENAMEX>, if I may second your searchlight brilliance dear <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vyv</ENAMEX>," adds
					Cyril, "the film assumes that consciousness and the brain are
					coterminous, congruent. That leaves out the whole rest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>,
					including the eyes, the muscles that move the lenses in the eyes, the
					skin of the hand that might hold the apple-everything else."
				"Why yes, of course," muses <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ambrose</ENAMEX> as the ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Bentley</ENAMEX> coughs,
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sneezes</ENAMEX> and is finally underway. "That means that the assertion about
					consciousness constituting the world is not proven by that argument.
					But what about the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Heisenberg101</NUMEX> quote-'atoms are
					not things'? We know from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bohr</ENAMEX> and others that the act of observation
					changes phenomena: observing a subatomic particle can determine either
					its location or its momentum, but not both. In fact, all we have are
					probabilities for where any given particle is prior to observation: it
					could be everywhere or nowhere.
				"Theories abound, darlings, to explain this uncertainty principle,
					but the purest is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Copenhagen</ENAMEX> consensus, right <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Cyril dear?</ENAMEX>" That
					there is no thing, no <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> we can call matter, or energy, or
					reality. All we can do is ascertain probabilities, which do not
					definitively prove anything is anywhere. "
				<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Ambrose</ENAMEX> interjects, "For that matter, it doesn't disprove it either."
				<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cyril</ENAMEX> is more measured. "In fairness, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bohr</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">formulation102</TIMEX> that there is no thing called reality is not the
					only way to see the universe. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Einstein</ENAMEX> might still be right that God
					does not play games. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David BÃ¶hm103</ENAMEX> sees implicate
					order. Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> are agnostic on the question of whether there
					is a "real" universe out there independent of our observation of it."
				"The best that can be said is that observation (and we could stretch
					and call that consciousness, I guess) is implicated in every
					phenomenon we can observe and seemingly in every phenomenon we can
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">theorize</ENAMEX> to explain. Think of superstring theories and the like!"
				"But this movie goes too far; it wants us to believe our
					consciousness creates reality, which is conventionally <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX>, but
					it's bad <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX> doctrine and bad science together. It's a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mare</ENAMEX>'s
					nest of post-Kantian goo that is far to keen on idealism."
				"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Well</ENAMEX>, my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chingachgook</ENAMEX>, let us show you the good old Berkeleyan
					reality of an <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> dinner. We'll go to an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX> for a
					hot curry!"
				"Not to go on about it," replies <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ambrose</ENAMEX>, "but I was confused by the
					discourse on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">addiction104</TIMEX> in the film. What did
					you think of that?"
				"Bah!" Vyvyan expostulates. We are told by that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elke Sommer</ENAMEX>
					look-alike with beautiful skin and blue <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eyeshadow105</ENAMEX> that everything we like or dislike is an addiction, but if
					we take a hot bath, we are transformed and can throw away our anxiety
					<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX>."
				"They should rather have said," agrees <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cyril</ENAMEX>, "that anti-depressants
					are a logical outcome of theories that brain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemicals</ENAMEX> and electrical
					connections among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neurons</ENAMEX> are the seat of emotional reactions of
					delight and distress. Readjustment of those electro <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemicals</ENAMEX> is a
					perfectly marvelous course to take, and even more so-a fortiori-- if
					consciousness is all somehow quantum-based addiction <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">chemistry?</ENAMEX>"
				The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bentley</ENAMEX> pulls up on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Finchley Road</ENAMEX>, in front of a popular <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX>
					eatery, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Indologist</ENAMEX>. "Let's eat! My addicted cells (another
					falsehood that the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> is the basic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> of consciousness) want food
					and a nice drinky."

				<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QUEER CRIME AND GAY GLOBALISM</ENAMEX>
				
				Much of the life of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lesbians</ENAMEX>, gay <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>, bisexuals, transgender,
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genderqueer</ENAMEX> and intersex <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> has been illegal, and this illegality
					has been a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">constituent</ENAMEX> factor in the development of new sub-cultures,

					that non/anti-normative sexual desire has created new modes of being
					and responded to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Law</ENAMEX> that seeks to channel desire into acceptable
					activities. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prostitution</ENAMEX>, pornography, inter-generational sex, drug
					use, unsafe sex, sexual activity in public or private are "crimes"
					said to characterize "queer" life. We will attempt to look at the
					<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">behaviors</ENAMEX> and beliefs of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> seeking sexual and emotional
					connections and their outcomes in modes of being that both create
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">shared</ENAMEX> subjectivities and build <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX>. These <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX> have

					and the anti-war <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hippie</ENAMEX> rock dramas of the pan-sexual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fugs</ENAMEX> will be
					looked at in early film and recordings of these performances, as well
					as films by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andy Warhol</ENAMEX>, whose decidedly "queer" <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Factory</ENAMEX> was the most

				Far from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> irony of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Warhol</ENAMEX> were the poetry of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Duncan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jack</ENAMEX>
					Spicer, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judy Grahn</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pat Parker</ENAMEX>. The gender-smashing antics of the
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cockettes</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> exemplify the collectively-made, often
					anonymous projects that contributed to the development of the
					gathering as an art form--beyond the Happening lay the Be-In and drag
					ritual. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Writer/performers</ENAMEX> and film <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> necessary to understanding
					this aesthetic are <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Smith</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth Anger</ENAMEX>, and documentarians of
					demonstrations and "tribal" gatherings of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> like the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gay</ENAMEX>
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Liberation Front</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Hundreds</NUMEX> of new "queer" <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> began their careers

					of many in the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> epidemic beginning in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1980</TIMEX>.
				
				"C'est admirable!" I told <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marcel</ENAMEX>, anxious to depart before he began

				Edom: (red) the name <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edom</ENAMEX> was given to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Esau</ENAMEX>, the first-born <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> of

					this they settled in southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Palestine</ENAMEX> and for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than four</NUMEX>

				39 Female genital <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">mutilation</ENAMEX> (FGM) is the term used to refer to the
					removal of part, or all, of the female <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">genitalia</ENAMEX>. The most severe form
					is infibulation, also known as pharaonic circumcision. An estimated
					<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15%</NUMEX> of all mutilations in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX> are infibulations. The procedure
					consists of clitoridectomy (where all, or part of, the clitoris is
					removed), excision (removal of all, or part of, the labia minora), and
					cutting of the labia majora to create raw surfaces, which are then
					stitched or held together in order to form a cover over the vagina
					when they heal. A small hole is left to allow urine and menstrual
					blood to escape. In some less conventional forms of infibulation, less
					tissue is removed and a larger opening is left.
				Girls undergoing the procedure have varying degrees of knowledge
					about what will happen to them. Sometimes the event is associated with
					<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">festivities</ENAMEX> and gifts. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Girls</ENAMEX> are exhorted to be brave. Where the
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mutilation</ENAMEX> is part of an initiation rite, the festivities may be major
					events for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX>. Usually only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> are allowed to be
					present.
				Sometimes a trained <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">midwife</ENAMEX> will be available to give a local
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">anaesthetic</ENAMEX>. In some cultures, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> will be told to sit beforehand in
					cold <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, to numb the area and reduce the likelihood of bleeding.
					More commonly, however, no steps are taken to reduce the pain. The
					<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> is immobilized, held, usually by older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, with her legs open.
					When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infibulation</ENAMEX> takes place, stitches may be used to hold the two
					sides of the labia majora together, and the legs may be bound together
					for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">up to 40 days</TIMEX>. Antiseptic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">powder</ENAMEX> may be applied, or, more usually,
					pastes - containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">herbs</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX>, ashes or dung - which are
					believed to facilitate healing. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> may be taken to a specially
					designated place to recover where, if the mutilation has been carried
					out as part of an initiation ceremony, traditional teaching is
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">imparted</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amnesty International</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>

					During the gold rush, land in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kakamega</ENAMEX> reserve was being distributed

					as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX>.
				<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mzee Kenyatta</ENAMEX> is acclaimed from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all quarters</TIMEX> of the world as a true
					<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX>, a renowned <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> of vision, initiative, guidance and

				At this stage he asked white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">settlers</ENAMEX> not to leave <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kenya</ENAMEX> and
					supported reconciliation. He retained the role of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prime minister</ENAMEX> after

				<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kenyatta</ENAMEX>'s policy was conciliatory and he kept many colonial civil
					<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">servants</ENAMEX> in their old jobs. He had to ask for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX>' help
					against <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Somali</ENAMEX> revolts in the northeast and an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX> mutiny in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nairobi</ENAMEX>
					(<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 1964</TIMEX>). Some <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> remained in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. On

				<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kenyatta</ENAMEX> instituted relatively peaceful land reform, oversaw <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kenya</ENAMEX>'s

					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Obote</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ugandaand Julius Nyerere</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tanzania</ENAMEX>. He pursued a non-aligned

					influential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">figure</ENAMEX> everywhere in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX>. However, his authoritarian
					policies drew criticism and caused dissent. (wikipedia.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">org</ENAMEX>)

				It is important to note that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malinowski</ENAMEX> was one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inventors</ENAMEX> of

					<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">missionaries</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kenya</ENAMEX>) on the grounds of non-intervention. Much debate
					has ensued over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</TIMEX> regarding clitoridectomy and female genital

				<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">101</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heisenberg</ENAMEX>'s discussions moved rather freely and quickly from
					talk about experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inaccuracies</ENAMEX> to epistemological or ontological
					issues and back again. However, ontological questions seemed to be of
					somewhat less interest to him. For example, there is a passage
					(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heisenberg</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1927</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p. 197</ENAMEX>), where he discusses the idea that, behind
					our observational data, there might still exist a hidden reality in
					which quantum systems have definite values for position and momentum,
					unaffected by the uncertainty relations. He emphatically dismisses
					this conception as an unfruitful and meaningless speculation, because,
					as he says, the aim of physics is only to describe observable data.
					Similarly in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicago Lectures</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Heisenberg 1930, p. 11</ENAMEX>) he warns
					against the fact that the human language permits the utterance of
					statements which have no empirical content at all, but nevertheless
					produce a picture in our imagination. He notes, "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">One</ENAMEX> should be
					especially careful in using the words 'reality', <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">'actually'</ENAMEX>, etc.,
					since these words very often lead to statements of the type just
					mentioned." So, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heisenberg</ENAMEX> also endorsed an interpretation of his
					relations as rejecting a reality in which particles have simultaneous
					definite values for position and momentum.

					assumes that the physical world has these properties in-itself, i.e.

				<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bohm</ENAMEX> suggests that the whole universe can be thought of as a kind of
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">giant</ENAMEX>, flowing hologram, or holomovement, in
					which a total order is contained, in some implicit sense, in each
					region of space and time. The explicate order is a projection from
					higher dimensional levels of reality, and the apparent stability and
					solidity of the objects and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> composing it are generated and
					sustained by a ceaseless process of enfoldment and unfoldment, for
					subatomic particles are constantly dissolving into the implicate order
					and then recrystallizing.
				
				The quantum potential postulated in the causal interpretation
					<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">corresponds</ENAMEX> to the implicate order. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bohm</ENAMEX> suggests that the quantum
					potential is itself organized and guided by a superquantum potential,
					representing a second implicate order, or superimplicate order. Indeed
					he proposes that there may be an infinite series, and perhaps
					hierarchies, of implicate (or "generative") orders, some of which form
					relatively closed loops and some of which do not. Higher implicate
					orders organize the lower ones, which in turn influence the higher.
				
				<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bohm</ENAMEX> believes that life and consciousness are enfolded deep in the
