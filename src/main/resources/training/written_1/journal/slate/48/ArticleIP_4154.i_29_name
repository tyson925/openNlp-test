            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>, then he moves,
opening door suddenlyheavy, further into the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">warehouse</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>, orperhaps we
drive uptown, city <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">darkening</ENAMEX>, leavingit all unsaid. You are thinner than ever.
We werechildren then really, my fast blue <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>, a beach,<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> in which you
placed objects with a gracethat flattered God. I was watching <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>, as you
were,swerving an old <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> out the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dirt</ENAMEX> drive afteryou put <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guests</ENAMEX> to bed. On your
knees in prayernow, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX>, fingers at the glands in my necklike every
gay <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> I know . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tweed</ENAMEX> and muffler, beardpatterned across a cheek. I
don't know howto get past this. In restaurant dark, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> movethrough our
conversation as if the past werea bright <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>. A mime's fingers. No one
makeslove, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> there have been so many. Oh darling, old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX>--of
beauty, of exuberantknowledge--turn as you close the door, take meas you did
then, a bouquet of lilac, a waltz.

            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Days</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rain</ENAMEX> until you
can't remember sun,breath on the mirror, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brothers</ENAMEX> and sistersaround a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">England</ENAMEX> table. I was hungryfor what you gave, awkward in my
largeness: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Delicate</ENAMEX> , you said, like a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Victorian</ENAMEX> .<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Offshore</ENAMEX>, low
sound of horns in fog, but the pastcomes proudly forward. Who could have told
usit was the present we would find in ruins?You move across the street like a
cello soundingor like grief--you who travel the placeswhere the texts were
written, cross every floorlike a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dancer</ENAMEX>. There is no wind. I want to hearyour
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">voice</ENAMEX>, ask how you are. Behind the atticwall: <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cookies</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">late night</TIMEX> talk of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bookor</ENAMEX> film. It's as if someone purposely disturbedthis: a brook runs loud in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">spring</ENAMEX>, you live herewith a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> who builds paper castles. I woresilk, you
carried <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> luggage. Who could seeit was our future we would find in
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ruins</ENAMEX>?

            Don't be
ridiculous! How would I phrase it?Is your blood poisoned? Or: What is it liketo
sit in a beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">room</ENAMEX> waiting it out?There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> of us here, bent, moving,
showingsigns of life, and the sky outside is near gray.<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursdays</TIMEX>, they cut the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">grass</ENAMEX>. Either I travelor stay home. Who are we to each other? I mean,when you
dream figures on a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>, am I everone of them? You put the key in a car
door,then drive <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred</NUMEX> as if we are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lovers</ENAMEX>.That <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stones</ENAMEX> painted white,
the desert, dustrising from the driveway, a lizard scuttles upa whitewashed
wall, we dine with a blackhaired womanfrom <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX>. One might argue we knew
nothingof love. Were the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> willows? Yes, andyou showed me <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> that grow
a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundred</NUMEX> yearsno matter how dry the ground. What is it I circlelike a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> in
weather, or a wooing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>?You're falling away, darling, aren't you?
Slowly.
