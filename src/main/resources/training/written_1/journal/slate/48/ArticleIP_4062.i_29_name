            The most electric moments in
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Corpus Christi</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Terrence McNally</ENAMEX>'s play about a gay <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus</ENAMEX>, come when you
arrive at the theater. Across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catholic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">protestors</ENAMEX> in white berets
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">recite Hail Marys</ENAMEX> into a megaphone. If you approach the police barricade that
pens them in, they ply you with leaflets charging that the play portrays "the
Blessed Virgin screaming obscenely to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Joseph</ENAMEX> for sexual relations" (sadly,
it doesn't). Thanks to the controversy, the entire run at the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">299</NUMEX> seat
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manhattan Theatre Club</ENAMEX> is sold out. Should you manage to lay hands on a ticket,
you have to run a gauntlet of burly security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guards</ENAMEX> and pass through an airport
metal detector to get to your seat.

            The
experience is disorienting--part <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">First Amendment</ENAMEX> vigil, part <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">X-rated</ENAMEX> movie.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Corpus Christi</ENAMEX> became instantaneously notorious in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX>, when the New
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">York Post</ENAMEX> revealed that it depicted a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus</ENAMEX> who has sex with his apostles.
After receiving telephone calls threatening violence, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manhattan Theatre</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Club</ENAMEX> canceled the production. But the play was reinstated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a week later</TIMEX> amid
protests from nearly every important dramatist in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> and many elsewhere.
Since restoring the play, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manhattan Theatre Club</ENAMEX> has been congratulating
itself on its fearless defense of free expression.

            What a letdown, then, to finally see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Corpus Christi</ENAMEX>
and encounter neither blasphemy nor artistic courage. On the first score, the
play comes up short. It is not, in fact, a work of savage (or even mild)
anti-clericalism, in the tradition of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marquis de Sade</ENAMEX> (whose every third
scene involves <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priests</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nuns</ENAMEX> performing unspeakable acts) or the films of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Luis Buñuel</ENAMEX> (most famously <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Viridiana</ENAMEX> , with its infamous parody of the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last Supper tableau</TIMEX>). There's no nudity or sex onstage, and though the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vatican</ENAMEX>
regards the notion of a noncelibate gay <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus</ENAMEX> as heretical, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">playwright</ENAMEX>'s
intention is not sacrilegious. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McNally</ENAMEX>'s updating of the life of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus</ENAMEX> is much
in the spirit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Godspell</ENAMEX> --if slightly more risqué. But while there's
nothing very shocking about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Corpus Christi</ENAMEX> , its dramatic and
intellectual thinness is stunning. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McNally</ENAMEX>'s real <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">offense</ENAMEX> is invoking a great
theme and an all-important principle for something as trite and banal as
this.

            The play
is in essence a gay retelling of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gospel</ENAMEX>. Thirteen male <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actors</ENAMEX> perform a
variety of parts in a series of sketches. In the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joshua</ENAMEX>, a k a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus</ENAMEX>, is
born in a sleazy <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East Texas</ENAMEX> motel <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> screaming for sex is on the
other side of a thin wall). At <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1950s</NUMEX>-era "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Pontius Pilate High</ENAMEX>" in Corpus
Christi, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>--the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McNally</ENAMEX> grew up--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joshua</ENAMEX> is bullied into playing
<ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">football</ENAMEX> and taunted by his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peers</ENAMEX> as a "faggot." An encounter in the school
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bathroom</ENAMEX> leads to an affair with a sinister <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classmate</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Judas</ENAMEX>. After
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">graduation</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joshua</ENAMEX> hitchhikes across the desert and has occasional
conversations with his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX>, God. He performs miracles and gathers <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">disciples</ENAMEX>.
One is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX>, another an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actor</ENAMEX>, another a male <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prostitute</ENAMEX>. They go to gay
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">discos</ENAMEX> and spread the Word. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joshua</ENAMEX> performs a marriage for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of the apostles.
After a scrumptious <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Last Supper, Judas</ENAMEX> betrays him with a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">kiss</ENAMEX>.
On the cross, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joshua</ENAMEX> is mocked as "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King of the Queers</ENAMEX>."

            
The staging and performances are competent, if
uninspired. The real limitations are those of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX>, whose hallmarks are
weak sophomoric humor and a cloying sentimentality. It's a gag line in this
play when someone exclaims "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus H. Christ</ENAMEX>!" <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph</ENAMEX> opposes naming his son
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus</ENAMEX>, because <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> will thing he's a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX>. "I hear hammering," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus</ENAMEX>
tells his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>. "Of course you do," she says. "Your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>'s a carpenter."
This is silly, and not really funny, but the intent is not to ridicule. The
spirit is rather one of camp reverence. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McNally</ENAMEX>, who was raised a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catholic</ENAMEX>,
apparently considers himself in sympathy with the deeper meaning of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christianity</ENAMEX>, which he boils down to an injunction to be nice to everybody. His
setting is supposed to teach us that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus</ENAMEX> loves gay <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, too. Lest anyone
miss the point, one of the apostles appears onstage to explain it to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> after the crucifixion. "If we have offended, so be it," he declares.
"He belongs to us as well as you."

            This is
weak <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX>. Equally pallid is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McNally</ENAMEX>'s stereotyped portrayal of gay
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. Like many of his other plays, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Corpus Christi</ENAMEX> seems like ethnic
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PR</ENAMEX>, in the vein of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fiddler</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Roof</ENAMEX> or the movie <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Moonstruck</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McNally</ENAMEX> wants to present <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homosexuals</ENAMEX> to heterosexuals as witty and wonderful.
Though his gay <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> aren't always perfect, the overall picture is of a
delightful bunch of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fellas</ENAMEX>. Gay <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> have flair, taste, and humor. They love
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Callas</ENAMEX> and cooking. They are sensitive and deep.

            Where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McNally</ENAMEX> fails time and again is by drawing gay people
as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">types</ENAMEX> rather than complex <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX>. Watch the clip from the film
version of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frankie</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnny</ENAMEX> , for which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McNally</ENAMEX> wrote the screenplay
based on his own theater play. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michelle Pfeiffer</ENAMEX>'s gay next-door <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX>,
played by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nathan Lane</ENAMEX>, is a cut-up, whose jokes are usually variations of the
theme of being a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who likes other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>. In another <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McNally</ENAMEX> play-turned-film,
the maudlin soap opera <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Love</ENAMEX>! Valour! Compassion! , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jason Alexander</ENAMEX> minces
around, puts on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>'s clothes, and continually bursts into show tunes. Watch
as he riffs on those annoying heterosexuals. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Corpus Christi</ENAMEX> ,
the disciple <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> are thinly sketched versions of familiar clichés: the
taciturn <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hairdresser</ENAMEX>, the buff male hustler, the yuppie <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX>. This may be
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bethlehem</ENAMEX>, but it's still <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Birdcage</ENAMEX> .

            By focusing on the fact that
the play portrays a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christ</ENAMEX> who has sex with his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">disciples</ENAMEX>, the press has
encouraged a misconception about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McNally</ENAMEX>'s work. Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> now assume that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Corpus Christi</ENAMEX> is an expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">ACT</ENAMEX>-UP-style radicalism--the theater
of queer outrage performed with an NEA grant. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McNally</ENAMEX> wants to enlarge the
bourgeoisie, not épater it. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Corpus Christi</ENAMEX> , like his other plays,
is a work of unchallenging, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">middlebrow</TIMEX> subscription theater on a touchy theme.
Of course, there's nothing wrong with middlebrow theater if done well. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neil</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Simon</ENAMEX> has his place. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neil Simon</ENAMEX> doesn't congratulate his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> for being
brave enough to laugh at his jokes. And <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neil Simon</ENAMEX> can be funny.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">producers</ENAMEX> of the play,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">basking</ENAMEX> in the glow of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">First Amendment</ENAMEX> martyrdom, have not done much to clear
up the misunderstanding. During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last spring</TIMEX>'s controversy, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McNally</ENAMEX>'s agent
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gilbert Parker</ENAMEX> was quoted complaining that no <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalist</ENAMEX> had bothered to
request a copy of the script of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corpus Christi</ENAMEX> . When I called to ask for
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Parker</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> told me that it wasn't releasing it. I don't think the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">playwright</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">theater</ENAMEX> wants <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to know that the play is largely
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inoffensive</ENAMEX>. The frisson of blasphemy has resulted in an overflowing
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">house.</ENAMEX> But were the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philistines</ENAMEX> at the barricades allowed inside, I fear they
would find little to stoke their fury--or hold their interest.
