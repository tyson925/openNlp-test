<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> will probably decline the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Judiciary Committee</ENAMEX>'s
invitation to testify in the impeachment inquiry, according to his
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">spokesman</ENAMEX>. The stated reason: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> thinks the inquiry has not been "fair."
This comes after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committee</ENAMEX> sent <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">81</NUMEX> questions, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> responded
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this weekend</TIMEX> with written answers that conceded nothing new (e.g., he maintains
he did not have sexual relations with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monica Lewinsky</ENAMEX> and did not lie under
oath about this). The spins: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> will impeach <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> because
he has failed to absorb the moral lessons of the scandal. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX>
will impeach <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> because they have failed to absorb the political lessons
of the scandal. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) The impeachment vote will fail, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> will reject
censure as a compromise because, while expedient, it's toothless and not
specified in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Constitution</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> will opt for censure because, while
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">toothless</ENAMEX> and not specified in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Constitution</ENAMEX>, it's expedient.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deutsche Bank</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>'s biggest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX>, is buying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bankers Trust</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$10</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">billion</ENAMEX>. It is the largest foreign purchase of a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> financial institution
ever, producing the biggest financial services <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> in the world in terms of
assets (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$850 billion</NUMEX>). The good news: Top <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> of both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> will get
multimillion dollar bonuses to keep them in the fold. The bad news: Five
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousand five hundred</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>, including administrative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> and some
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX>, will be laid off because their jobs have suddenly become duplicative.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Attorney General</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Janet Reno</ENAMEX> asked a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60 more days</TIMEX> to decide whether to
seek the appointment of an independent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counsel</ENAMEX> to investigate former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinton</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aide</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harold Ickes</ENAMEX> in the campaign finance scandal. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Reporters</ENAMEX> complained
that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reno</ENAMEX> has not explained what she would do for those <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60 days</TIMEX>. Translation:
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Reporters</ENAMEX> who have been so desperate for political news that they have been
writing speculative stories for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Reno</ENAMEX>'s decision don't know what they
would do for those <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60 days</TIMEX>. This comes after <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Reno</ENAMEX> decided not to seek an
independent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counsel</ENAMEX> to investigate whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Gore</ENAMEX> violated
fund-raising laws in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> campaign. Spins on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> decision: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reno</ENAMEX>
nixed the investigation because, as she says, "The evidence fails to provide
any reasonable basis for a conclusion that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> may have lied."
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) She nixed the investigation to protect <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) She nixed it
because <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth Starr</ENAMEX> proved that the independent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counsel</ENAMEX> law is bad. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) She
nixed it because <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX> proved that the independent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counsel</ENAMEX> law is bad for the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>) Her decision helps <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX>'s presidential candidacy by
reaffirming his integrity. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>) Her decision helps <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX>'s presidential candidacy
because it would be hard for him to raise money for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> while being
investigated over how he raised money in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>. (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">11/30/98</NUMEX>)
            

            
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>'s highest court ruled that former <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chilean</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dictator</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Augusto Pinochet</ENAMEX>
can be extradited to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">prosecution</ENAMEX> on charges of murder and
torture. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pinochet</ENAMEX> had argued that he was immune from arrest because his alleged
crimes were part of his job as head of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. But the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judges</ENAMEX> ruled that
"torture of his own <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> or of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aliens</ENAMEX> would not be regarded by
international law as a function of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>." Unless <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>'s home
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary intervenes</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pinochet</ENAMEX> persuades the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX> to block the
extradition on other grounds, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pinochet</ENAMEX> will be packed off to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Human</ENAMEX>
rights <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activists</ENAMEX> celebrated the ruling as a breakthrough for international law
and justice. On the other side, former <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prime Minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Margaret Thatcher</ENAMEX>
argued that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pinochet</ENAMEX> "is old, frail, and sick, and on compassionate grounds
alone should be allowed to return to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chile</ENAMEX>." (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">11/25/98</NUMEX>)

the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Republican Senatorial Committee</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McConnell</ENAMEX> has been criticized
because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GOP</ENAMEX> failed to gain any seats in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX>, contrary to
expectations. Explaining that "one of the things <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> learned in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX> is
you can't just win by beating up on your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponent</ENAMEX>," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hagel</ENAMEX> complained that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GOP</ENAMEX>'s message has been insufficiently "positive," and he denounced the
"constant, demonizing, negative campaigning" of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX>'s elections. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX>
think <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hagel</ENAMEX> has little chance of winning. (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">11/25/98</NUMEX>)

buying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Netscape</ENAMEX>. The deal involves a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$4 billion</NUMEX> stock swap and a
simultaneous partnership between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AOL</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sun Microsystems</ENAMEX>. Everyone agrees
these transactions create a potentially powerful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">alliance</ENAMEX> against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>,

because <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Netscape</ENAMEX> adds muscle. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) The antitrust case against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>
emboldened its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">competitors</ENAMEX> to form this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">alliance</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) The pending <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">alliance</ENAMEX>,
under discussion for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past month</TIMEX>, emboldened the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">allies</ENAMEX> to testify against
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> in the antitrust case. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>) The sale of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Netscape</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$4 billion</NUMEX> debunks
the antitrust case by proving that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> didn't hurt <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Netscape</ENAMEX> much. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>) The
