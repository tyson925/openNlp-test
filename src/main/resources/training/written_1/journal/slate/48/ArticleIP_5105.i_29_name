            The recent vote to hold
impeachment hearings over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Flytrap</ENAMEX>, we know, hewed closely to party lines; only
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> broke ranks. But the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democratic</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Republican</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> did purport to agree on this: The vote was supposed to be one of
"conscience." Responding to reports that he was muscling <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX> for support,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> insisted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> before the decision that everyone should
"cast a vote of principle and conscience." Likewise, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Speaker</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Newt</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gingrich</ENAMEX> promised, "There will be no arm-twisting. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Members</ENAMEX> need to take this
vote as a matter of conscience."

            
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> suffers such bouts of conscience periodically, usually when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>
faces a vote with dicey political consequences. During the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Gulf War</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Speaker</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Foley</ENAMEX> assured <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX>, "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Individual</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> are going to vote with
their conscience and their judgment on this matter." The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>
agreed: "This is a vote of conscience and not something you can involve party
loyalty on."

            It's not hard to hear in all these comments the
reverberations of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> protesting too much. Most of the time, we're left to
conclude, these craven, opportunistic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pols</ENAMEX> will crumple, tossing aside their
deeply held convictions at the slightest blandishments. Only on an
extraordinary occasion do principles carry <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX>.

            The
conscience talk also suggests something else that's taken for granted: Voting
with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> is bad and voting according to conscience--and potentially against
party--is good. "I wanted to show my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">constituents</ENAMEX> I wasn't afraid to go against
my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX>," <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arkansas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jay Dickey</ENAMEX> told the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> ,
explaining why he supported the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democratic</ENAMEX> proposal. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Voters</ENAMEX> endorse this
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">premise</ENAMEX>, affiliating themselves less and less with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">either party</ENAMEX> and splitting
their tickets in the voting <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">booth</ENAMEX> more and more.

            
How did party loyalty get such a bad name? In
his new book, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Good Citizen: A History of American Civic Life ,</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Schudson</ENAMEX> divides <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> history into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> periods, each governed by
a different notion of civic participation. In the early <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Republic</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> were
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">anathema</ENAMEX>, viewed as self-interested cabals whose aims conflicted with an
otherwise discernible common good. In his famous "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Federalist No. 10</ENAMEX>,"
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Madison</ENAMEX> wrote of "the mischiefs of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">faction</ENAMEX>"--taken to be a synonym for,
or the worst manifestation of, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Washington</ENAMEX>, elected unanimously
and without party affiliation, cautioned in his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Farewell</ENAMEX> Address against
"the baneful effects of the spirit of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX>." Everyone was expected to vote
according to conscience all the time.

            The
conceit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> by peaceable consensus was soon exposed as chimerical. By
the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">1790s</NUMEX>, the young <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> promptly split into warring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX>: the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New England</ENAMEX>-centered <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Federalists</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southern</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX>. (For more
on the confusing history of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX>, click .) The problem was that each
party had different ideas about what the common good entailed: For the
Federalists it meant a strong central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>, an expanding economy, and the
stewardship of an elite ruling class. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> envisioned a weaker
federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>, an agrarian society, and an infusion of democracy.

            Though the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Federalist</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> split was short-lived,
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> were recognizing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> as inevitable in a democracy. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> in
the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">1810s</NUMEX>, future <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin Van Buren</ENAMEX> led a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">coalition</ENAMEX> called the
"Bucktails" or the "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Albany Regency</ENAMEX>" against the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elites</ENAMEX> who dominated state
politics. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the great forgotten figures of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> history, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Van Buren</ENAMEX>
pioneered party discipline as a way to muster the strength of numbers against
the entrenched closed-door aristocracy, transforming state and later national
politics. (It was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Van Buren</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ally</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William L. Marcy</ENAMEX> who famously said, "To the
victors belong the spoils," making the "spoils system" of rewarding supporters
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fixture</ENAMEX> of party politics.)

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Van</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buren</ENAMEX>'s politicking ushered in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> era of citizenship in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Schudson</ENAMEX>'s
scheme. During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19 th century</TIMEX>, parties thrived. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrew Jackson</ENAMEX>'s
election as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1828</TIMEX>, for whom <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Van Buren</ENAMEX> would later serve as vice
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>, crystallized his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supporters</ENAMEX> into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Democratic Party</ENAMEX>, his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponents</ENAMEX>
into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whigs</ENAMEX>. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late century</TIMEX>, elections had become ebulliently partisan
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">affairs</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX> paraded in torchlight processions, waved
banners, sang songs. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Newspapers</ENAMEX> unabashedly pitched the news from a partisan
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">slant</ENAMEX>. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Election Day</TIMEX>, party <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> handed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> tickets with slates of
candidates printed upon them; the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voter</ENAMEX> just dropped the ticket in the ballot
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">box.</ENAMEX> Turnout was never higher. Whatever its faults, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">democracy</ENAMEX> was bustling and
vital.

            
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Elite reformers</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gilded Age</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Progressive Era</ENAMEX> put a stop to all this. Appalled by the rampant corruption of
the spoils system, they instituted civil service reform and the "<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Australian</ENAMEX>"
secret ballot. They crippled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> by empowering <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> through the
referendum and the popular election of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senators</ENAMEX>. The times celebrated
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">objectivity</ENAMEX>, expertise, and efficiency: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Voters</ENAMEX> now had to stay informed and
engaged to make more choices independently. Since then, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> have continued
to lose both power and credibility. "<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> the labels [of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX>] are shunned as
an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">offense</ENAMEX> to a thinking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>'s individualism, and a vast majority of
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> insist they vote for 'the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>, not the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX>,' " writes political
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">scientist Larry Sabato</ENAMEX>.

            There's
no arguing that a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">democracy</ENAMEX> needs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> who can think for
themselves. Perhaps <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX> we'll even achieve that. Still, there are some
reasons to prefer the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19 th century</TIMEX>'s embrace of partisanship to
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s exaltation of the conscience-serving, hyper-responsible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX>--or
what I once heard called the "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Broder</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">League of Women Voters</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> of
politics."

            As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Van Buren</ENAMEX> knew, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> are inherently democratic, the
most effective way of organizing otherwise powerless <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>. With <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$4</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">billion</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ross Perot</ENAMEX> can avoid party ties and just run for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>. For most
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to compete they need to come together and to raise funds, agree upon a
platform, choose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX>, and so on. Party loyalty and discipline make that
possible, and that sometimes means both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> must
subordinate individual differences.

            There's a
conservative case for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX>, too, articulated by the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">th century</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">philosopher Edmund Burke</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Burke</ENAMEX> believed that the principles shared by party
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> should bind them together, even when they encounter particular
differences about their application (and despite some blurring of lines, party
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> do still ). Indeed, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> owe it to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> not to discard
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> line for personal gain. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Connecticut</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX> who voted for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lieberman</ENAMEX> over the liberal <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lowell Weicker</ENAMEX> have every right to feel
betrayed when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lieberman</ENAMEX> deserts a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democratic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> in a partisan fight.
It's basic truth in advertising.

            
What's more, the decline of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voter</ENAMEX> turnout this
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">century</ENAMEX> shows that our current arrangement leaves many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> feeling
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ill</ENAMEX>-equipped to participate in democracy. Who hasn't entered a voting <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">booth</ENAMEX> and
been utterly baffled about how to vote on a referendum or whom to choose for
some lower position? A party <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">line</ENAMEX> comes in handy. The notion of the informed
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizen</ENAMEX> puts too much pressure on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>, where the cruder but more
inspiring politics of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gilded Age</ENAMEX> mobilized <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Election Day</TIMEX>.

            Finally,
parties help keep political power in balance, as even the anti-party <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alexander</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hamilton</ENAMEX> saw. In "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Federalist No. 70</ENAMEX>," he wrote, "the jarrings of parties
[in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>], though they may sometimes obstruct salutary plans, yet often
promote deliberation and circumspection, and serve to check excesses in the
majority." If you think <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> should be ousted, surely you're glad the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> have united to impeach him. And if you think the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> are an
out-of-control majority bent on revenge, surely you're happy to see <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX>
rallying to stop them. When it comes to extraordinary moments of political
crisis, "conscience" sometimes just gets in the way.
