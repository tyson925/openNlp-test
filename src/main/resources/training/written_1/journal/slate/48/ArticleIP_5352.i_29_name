            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last week</TIMEX>, to mark his
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">20 th</NUMEX> anniversary as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pope</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Paul II</ENAMEX> issued an encyclical, "Fides
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et Ratio</ENAMEX>," calling on the faithful to reconcile faith and reason. Rationalists
reasonably ask: How does one do that? If faith tells you that God created
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">humankind</ENAMEX> in the garden of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eden</ENAMEX> and reason tells you humankind evolved from
lower <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, how do you reconcile those messages? If
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">faith</ENAMEX> tells you that the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Communion wafer</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christ</ENAMEX> and
reason tells you this seems highly unlikely, where do you go from there?

            Various
subdivisions of various religions have various strategies for reconciling faith
and reason. Here are a few, on a rough spectrum from faith wins to reason
wins:

            

               <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 Fundamentalism/Literalism</ENAMEX>
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Literalist</ENAMEX> approaches to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bible/Torah/Koran</ENAMEX> contend that when reason contradicts the word of God ,
reason is misguided. This philosophy is summed up in the battle cry of many a
literalist: Nothing is impossible with God. Scientific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">proofs</ENAMEX> that contradict
biblical stories of the great flood or creation are wrong and have been derived
through erroneous means. The debate over evolution is probably the
best-known example of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">literalists</ENAMEX>' combination of rock hard belief and
relentless point by point challenge of the rationalist side.

            
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Literalists</ENAMEX> often warn against too much reliance on knowledge as opposed
to truth as revealed through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scripture</ENAMEX>. It is this obsession and lust
for knowledge that caused the human condition (suffering, evil, painful
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">childbirth</ENAMEX>, etc.) in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> place: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eve</ENAMEX>'s craving for enlightenment is
what led her to eat from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> of knowledge, after which God expelled her
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Adam</ENAMEX> from paradise.

            

               <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Faith Complements Reason</ENAMEX>
            

            This is the position the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pope</ENAMEX> takes in his latest encyclical. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Faith</ENAMEX> and reason are argued to be
logical complements. God empowered <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> with reason precisely so that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">humankind</ENAMEX> might come to a better understanding of God and God's creation.
"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Fides et Ratio</ENAMEX>" says there is thus no reason for competition of any kind
between reason and faith. Each contains the other, and each has its own scope
for action. Officially, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catholic Church</ENAMEX> gives reason the same weight as
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">faith</ENAMEX>. If you use your reason in the way it was intended, you will discover the
wonder and mystery in God's creation and, in turn, you will come to a greater
understanding and appreciation of God.

            Those who
favor this approach often tend to see philosophy and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scripture</ENAMEX> as
sharing the key to the ultimate truth. The pursuit of knowledge is good, not
bad, because it leads closer to the actual truth: God and God's plan. Without
reason and knowledge, say <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catholics</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">believers</ENAMEX> in this way of
reconciling reason with faith, the teachings of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bible</ENAMEX> look like magical
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fables</ENAMEX> instead of moral teachings. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Novak</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">theologian</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enterprise Institute</ENAMEX>, sums up the basic premise of this approach, saying that
without lively attention to reason, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Judaism</ENAMEX> and Christianity fall into
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sentimentality</ENAMEX>, superstition, and self-parody.

            

               <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3 Apples</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oranges</ENAMEX>
            

            Another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> of thought
contends that faith and reason occupy <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different realms of knowing.
They are so dissimilar that they cannot contradict one another. Reason
encompasses the physical, while faith deals with the metaphysical. The seen and
unseen are independent of each other: You don't read the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bible</ENAMEX> for answers to
scientific questions, and you don't read a biology textbook to find out how to
live.

            The basic
premise of this line is that the findings of faith and reason are not at
odds--only their methods are. Reason is objective --discovered in
the outside world. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Faith</ENAMEX> is subjective --discovered within. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Faith</ENAMEX> is
about the metaphysical world, that world of events, occurrences, and mysteries
that by their very nature can never be proved objectively.

            

               <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4 Cultural/Historical</ENAMEX> Relativism
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Relativists</ENAMEX> hold that
religious texts written <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX> ago must be interpreted within the
cultural and historical context of their times. The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bible</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Koran</ENAMEX> were
written when the scientific laws the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20 th century</TIMEX> takes for granted
were nonexistent. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> had to make their points in terms that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of
the time would understand. For example, had the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> of the Genesis creation
story been composing for a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">20 th</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readership</ENAMEX>, he or she would
have explained God's hand in the evolutionary process as opposed to the more
magical creation story in the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bible</ENAMEX>. Likewise, had <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Talmudic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> had the
sanitary conditions of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, laws for keeping kosher might have been
much less stringent or possibly omitted altogether.

            Though
this approach will seem quite reasonable to rationalists, it is one of the more
controversial approaches to reconciling faith and reason. Its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> complain
that God's truths are not and cannot be relative to the time they are
written. There is a moral absolute that supersedes cultural and historical
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">contexts</ENAMEX>.

            

               <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5 Religious Texts</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Allegorical Moral</ENAMEX>
Literature
            

            Possibly the antithesis of
literalist theories, this approach assumes that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scriptures</ENAMEX> were written
solely for the purpose of conveying a moral message. Much like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aesop</ENAMEX>'s fables,
these theological works are said to use myth, imagery, and symbolism to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">instruct</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> how to lead a good life. They are not historical or factual
documents, since all the events within were composed as literary
tools .

            Once again, this is an
oft-criticized approach. If the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bible and Koran</ENAMEX> are simply books of myths with
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">morals</ENAMEX>, then they are no different from any other moral literature--they are
stripped of their sacred significance.

            
The challenge the pope has thrown down is a
formidable <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>. Reconciling faith and reason is hard work. There are other ways
to go about it, but these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> should be enough to get you started, God
willing.
