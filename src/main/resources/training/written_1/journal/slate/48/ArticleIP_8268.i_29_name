            Hats arouse fully as much
feeling as hairstyles--or they would if enough of them were being worn. For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> we have been living in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bareheaded Age</ENAMEX>, worrying intensely about our
hair. Many of us don't even remember the time when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> would no more go
outdoors without a hat than they would without shoes. The exact <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> of
your hat mattered a lot then, much as the look of your hair does now. Your hat
confirmed your <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outfit</ENAMEX>, putting the final seal on whatever else you wore,
crowning your image and arming your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ego</ENAMEX> for social and professional life--or
just for itself. During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandfather</ENAMEX> would put on
his hat to go down to the end of the driveway and get the letters out of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mailbox</ENAMEX>. I would laugh at him, free of the requirement myself; but in his
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youth</ENAMEX>, even <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> wore hats whenever they went outdoors.

            Hair rose
up and drove out hats in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s</TIMEX>--rose up, spread out, and flowed down in
merciless torrents, sweeping away conventional hats as if they represented all
that was loathsome in civilized life. A few cute hats, most of them faintly
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">satirical</ENAMEX>, costumey, and historical, were worn by a few cute <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> for
momentary effect. But the old hat rule was swiftly abolished. Off came the top
hat at the opera and the elegant homburg or fedora for street wear, along with
the whole range of casual hats and caps for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>.

            Swept away, too, were all the charming, infinitely various
feminine hats that once made <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> feel charming and infinitely various
themselves. Common usage once allowed hat <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">makers</ENAMEX> to find markets for many
heterogeneous styles, for much discreetly suggestive fantasy in shape and trim.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Absurdity</ENAMEX> was the obvious risk then, given the vast scope of hat design for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Danny Kaye</ENAMEX> once sang of "The little ones, the big ones, the
sat-on<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">-by-a-</NUMEX>pig ones,/ The foolish ones that perch, and the ghoulish ones that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lurch</ENAMEX>." But a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> might still be seduced by an irresistible feminine brim,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">curving</ENAMEX> and dipping to offset a meaningful glance. The desired effect appeared
in the movies on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heads</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Greta Garbo</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marlene Dietrich</ENAMEX> and their
glamorous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX>, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gene Tierney in Laura</ENAMEX> in her scene at the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algonquin</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clifton Webb</ENAMEX>.

            Along with
much else, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>'s hats are no longer a normal part of the mating game. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Women</ENAMEX>'s
hats are out there, but they're all optional, and the range has shrunk. They
come in very few basic shapes (like dresses), and nobody gets any basic
training in hat choice or hat <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>, since real allure is felt to reside
in hair, not in hats. Real absurdity, too, of course.

            
But <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> is coming. The <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Hair Revolution</ENAMEX> was
no help in bitter weather, and for a while everybody but <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Floridians</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Californians</ENAMEX> simply froze above the neck. Lately healthy, utilitarian hats have
returned in force, along with athletic footgear and down jackets, and there's
even a certain limited stylishness in recent examples. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fur</ENAMEX> is back, too, as are
delicious pile fabrics, so that luxury can be combined with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX>. Meanwhile
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of watch caps, ear-flap caps, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wool berets</ENAMEX> are available from
street <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendors</ENAMEX> to provide instant warmth for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passers-by</ENAMEX> without much regard for
expressive charm. In this day of virtual uniformity, it's curious that whenever
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> wears any hat at all, somebody is bound to say, "I love your hat!"--as
if out of subliminal nostalgia for the truly great <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>.

            Nobody
says this to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> about their baseball caps, the ubiquity of which has reduced
choices for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> just as general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hatlessness</ENAMEX> has diminished the possibilities
for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. What are old-fashioned hat-loving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> to do? Classic hats appear
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pretentious</ENAMEX> and dandified. But such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> could never wear--can barely
stomach--headgear with the inelegance, the laddishness, the rakishness, the
nerve of a baseball cap, especially one worn backward.

            Nevertheless, let us hope that the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Return of the Hat</ENAMEX> is at
hand, inaugurated by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> in their baseball caps, just as the strongest and
longest-lasting fashion changes always have been inspired by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>. The hat
itself was a male invention and a male privilege until <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> got tired of
coifs, veils, and wimples in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX>. Then they daringly adopted hats
to profit from the erotic charge male <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> always add to feminine modes.
Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> have done this again in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last decade or so</TIMEX>, usually sticking to
masculine sports hat shapes, baseball caps among them, or east <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX>
rabbinical effects to combat the cold blast.

            I bought a fine example of
that kind of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> hat. It surrounds my head in a warm nimbus of fake fur, my
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">brow</ENAMEX>, ears, and nape encompassed by golden foxy fleece, my pate upholstered
with plushy leopard pelt, my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">beardless</ENAMEX> face mitigating the rabbinical flavor.
I've also acquired a neat hat that makes a black, furry sphere out of my whole
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">skull</ENAMEX>, leaving some wisps of my hair to curl up my cheeks and down my forehead,
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heroine</ENAMEX> style. More risky, since I'm not tall, is my cavalier hat in
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">silvery</ENAMEX>, streaked brown and black velvet, with a biggish mobile brim for
folding up and down at will, fore and aft or amidships.

            Short, small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> have to
remember that they can quickly resemble a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mushroom</ENAMEX> in anything too big or a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> in anything too cute. Medium-sized or large and tall <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> have no such
problem and tend to look good in any kind of hat. They only have to remember to
let enough of their face show and not to let the hat flatten them on top, so
that their full-sized, shapely <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> and speaking eyes will support the hat's
dashing impact, and the hat itself won't appear to jam a lid on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>'s
expressive means. Advice to all: Study the older royals for the way they manage
good proportions, especially the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Queen Mum</ENAMEX>, and don't forget to study
your own full-length hatted reflection--front, back, and profile--before
hitting the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Absurdity</ENAMEX> forever lurks.
