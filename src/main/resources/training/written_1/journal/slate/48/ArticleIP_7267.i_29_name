            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s stock
rocketed around the world as front pages celebrated the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX>' success in
the midterm elections. "Revenge" was a very popular word in headlines. "The
Revenge of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Clinton</ENAMEX>" was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX>'s front-page headline in
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Le Monde</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX>.
"<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Revenge</ENAMEX>," echoed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">La Repubblica</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX>. Most <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX> pointed up the
"euphoria" in the stock markets or, as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Repubblica</ENAMEX> put it, "Sexgate:
Failed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Operation</ENAMEX>." <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stampa of Turin</ENAMEX> said, "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">America Absolves Clinton ... The Bush Dynasty Is</ENAMEX>
Born."

            In
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>, the Frankfurter
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Allgemeine Zeitung</ENAMEX> led its front page <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> with the headline "Vote of
Confidence for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congressional Elections</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Unexpected Win for the</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX>," while <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Munich</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung</ENAMEX> announced, "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Success</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Democratic</ENAMEX>
Party" and highlighted the unseating of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al D'Amato</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX>'s "theft"
of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>.

            In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX>, under the headline "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s tactics pay off for
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX>," reported that "stunned <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX> woke up <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> to find their
election victories had outstripped their loftiest predictions." Meanwhile, the
conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daily</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Telegraph</ENAMEX> downplayed the story with a small front-page reference, which
noted, however, that "the vote, which halved the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">majority</ENAMEX> in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House of Representatives</ENAMEX> and froze it in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX>, was the best mid-term
performance by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1930s</TIMEX>." The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Independent</ENAMEX> shouted,
"<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>: 'We turned tide of history,' " while the liberal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guardian</ENAMEX> confined the story
to Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> under the headline "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> hails 'vindication.' "

            In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hindu</ENAMEX> said
that "the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX> have held their own in a remarkable fashion," while <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>'s
biggest-selling paper, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asahi Shimbun</ENAMEX>, reported that "the outcome of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US</ENAMEX>
mid-term elections conveyed a clear message from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> should
pay more attention to the livelihood of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>." The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South China Morning Post</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kong</ENAMEX> used the headline "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> joy over historic election gain," while the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Straits Times</ENAMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Singapore</ENAMEX> described the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX> as the "victors." In the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philippines</ENAMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manila</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bulletin</ENAMEX> reported that "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanics</ENAMEX> rallied to support
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Clinton</ENAMEX> against threatened impeachment" and, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>, the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Dawn</ENAMEX> said, "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Americans</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">reject Clinton</ENAMEX>'s impeachment."

            
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australia</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sydney Morning Herald</ENAMEX> headlined
"<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> burning with bitter defeat," while in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Africa</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cape</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Argus</ENAMEX> said,
"<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary</ENAMEX>'s power saves <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacon</ENAMEX> at polls." In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Globe and Mail</ENAMEX> said,
"<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> vow to press impeachment crusade" and that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX> "warn
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foes</ENAMEX> to back off."

            In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Financial Times</ENAMEX> gave much greater
prominence to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> offer of a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$5 million</NUMEX> reward for information leading to
the arrest of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Osama bin Laden</ENAMEX>. Nevertheless, in an editorial <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> the paper
said that the midterm elections were a victory for political moderation. It
said, "If the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> allows the religious right to dominate the
debate, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> will condemn itself to another <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four years</TIMEX> outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">House.</ENAMEX> ... The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> has made clear that it likes to take its politics in
moderation."

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Le Monde</ENAMEX> 's second
front-page story, headlined " 'Indian' or 'whale'? A real ecological dilemma,"
was devoted to a bitter conflict between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conservationists</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Native American</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whale hunters</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Neah Bay</ENAMEX>, northwest of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Seattle</ENAMEX>.
