            The battle over Internet
censorship has taken up residence in your neighborhood public <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Conservatives</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> and elsewhere are demanding that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> apply
"filters" to Internet terminals available to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minors</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ernest Istook</ENAMEX>, a
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oklahoma</ENAMEX>, recently proposed denying federal
funds to any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> that fails to use filters. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Istook</ENAMEX>'s amendment wound up on
the cutting <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> floor when the budget bill was finalized <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</TIMEX>, but it may
re-emerge <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</TIMEX>. Meanwhile in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX>, someone has sued his local library
for filtering Internet content. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>, someone else has sued hers for
not doing so. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Library Association</ENAMEX>, along with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Civil</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Liberties Union</ENAMEX>, takes the absolutist position that any restriction on library
Internet access--including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> narrowly tailored to keep <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> away from
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pornography</ENAMEX>--violates <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">First Amendment</ENAMEX> freedoms.

            This
debate became inevitable when public <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> began to get wired, a
development that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Gore</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Newt Gingrich</ENAMEX> both consider crucial to our
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>'s future, and which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Gates</ENAMEX> has set up a foundation to support. But
down the road, public <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> face a bigger and more vexing question than
this rehash of old censorship debates. Why, if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> are growing more
concerned about the provision of Internet access and less concerned about the
circulation of books, must they be housed in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> with walls? Someone who
uses his neighborhood <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> to surf the Net doesn't really depend on the
library the way that someone who went to do research or borrow out of print
books did. He merely uses an inefficient subsidy for something that is
increasingly cheap and easy to do at home--and which could soon be subsidized
directly at far lower expense. In other words, if the public <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> of the
future is mainly about free online access, it's in a mess of trouble.

            Another technological advance threatens <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Oct.</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">NuvoMedia</ENAMEX> rolled out the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-generation digital
reading device, a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$500</NUMEX> appliance called the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">Rocket eBook</ENAMEX>. It's <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Version</ENAMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.0</NUMEX>--expensive, a bit clunky and, according to previews, not really pleasant
enough for pleasure reading. But within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few years</TIMEX>, such devices are likely to
be a viable, even preferable, way to read books. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dick Brass</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>'s vice
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> for technology development, says that the technical hurdles of screen
quality and battery life have been largely surmounted. The question is how soon
a comfortable device can be built for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$100</NUMEX> and how long it will take for a
large number of titles to become available. The probable answer is not long.
Already, a nonprofit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Project Gutenberg</ENAMEX> has digitized over
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,000</NUMEX> public domain works ranging from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paradise Lost</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Swift</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">& His Aerial Warship</ENAMEX> . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Publishers</ENAMEX> are scrambling to put current books
on sale in electronic form. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brass</ENAMEX> predicts that you'll be able to get <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50,000</NUMEX>
titles electronically--more than you can find in an average <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barnes & Noble</ENAMEX>
franchise--in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</TIMEX>.

            Of course,
there are some big issues that need to be negotiated before e-books put
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">libraries</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bookstores</ENAMEX> out of business. You may be able to digitize the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">million</ENAMEX> books in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Library</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a mere billion dollars</NUMEX>, but much
of that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">material</ENAMEX> falls under copyright protection. While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publishers</ENAMEX> accept
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequential</ENAMEX> borrowings a single copy of a book from a library, they can't very
well provide free universal access to everything in their catalogs. And while
e-books have tremendous appeal in theory--imagine an entire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> that weighs
a pound, is word-searchable, and can be read in the dark (and, at long last, a
copy of 
                  Slate
                that you can take to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bathroom</ENAMEX>)--<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> simply
may not cotton to them. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">etopians</ENAMEX> who are certain that digital reading
devices are about to take over probably underestimate the doggedness of
ingrained human habits. So we should pose this as a what-if and not a what-when
question. If electronic reading supplants print as the primary means by
which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> absorb written texts, what becomes of the venerable public
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">library</ENAMEX>?

            
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Library</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>, who recognize the possibility,
are doing what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in threatened professions do. They begin from the
assumption that they will always be crucially necessary and then try to figure
out what they will be necessary for. Unsurprisingly, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">librarians</ENAMEX> have reached a
consensus that technological progress demands an expansion, not a contraction,
of their role. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">disciples</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Melvil Dewey</ENAMEX> would have you know that they are
no longer underpaid scriveners on index cards. In fact, they no longer want to
be called <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">librarians</ENAMEX> at all. They're now "information <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX>," who
understand search engines and retrieval systems and sort out good information
from bad on the Internet. They aspire to the rise in status and income that
computer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">geeks</ENAMEX> benefited from in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1980s</TIMEX>.

            It is
probably true that we will need skillful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">librarians</ENAMEX>, and maybe even more
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">librarians</ENAMEX>, in etopia. While doing research on the Internet can be vastly more
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>- and cost-efficient than doing it in the stacks, it requires a good deal
of instruction. In an unfamiliar world, we need guides all the more. What is
less clear is that we will need <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>--or at least the same kind of
libraries we have now in the quantity we now have them.

            There is little cause for anyone to fret about the high-end
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX>--academic, research, and specialized <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> will be no less
necessary. Those who seek to understand the past are always going to want to
examine original documents, manuscripts, and hard-copy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publications</ENAMEX>. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">novelist Nicholson Baker</ENAMEX>, an eloquent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critic</ENAMEX> of what <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> have done in the
name of modernization, is certainly right about how foolish many great
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">libraries</ENAMEX> were to destroy their card catalogs after transferring them to
electronic form. As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> argued in a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX> article in The 
               New
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yorker</ENAMEX> , the old cards are not just eerily beautiful artifacts but also
important historical documents. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> was on shakier ground in his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">article</ENAMEX> attacking the new, post-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gutenberg</ENAMEX> era <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> public <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> for
emphasizing electronic research at the expense of old books. Why must a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nonacademic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> maintain, at great public expense, a vast <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX> of volumes
that no one uses?

            It is the more ordinary
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">libraries</ENAMEX>--the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9,000</NUMEX> public and branch <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>--that face a real threat of redundancy. That is not to say that these
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX> don't have functions beyond lending out books. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> of mine
who used to teach in an overcrowded <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York City</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> makes the point that
for a lot of poor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> is the only place to do homework after
school. Public <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> should provide an <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> haven, but in the real
world, they don't. It would be terrible to get rid of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX> that works
without figuring out how to reproduce its effectiveness. Libraries are also
places where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX> go to take <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> classes and where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">illiterates</ENAMEX> learn
to read. They are meeting places that cut against the isolation of modern life.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>, the downtown public <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> is the rare place where social classes
mix.

            But even with the reservoir
of good will public <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> have, such ancillary functions aren't enough to
keep them alive if their basic purpose fades. Our public <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> were built
so that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX>, and especially young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, could enhance their lives
through access to the written word. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">The day</TIMEX> may be not so far off when we can
accomplish this function better with a subsidized Internet account and a free
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">digital</ENAMEX> reading device.
