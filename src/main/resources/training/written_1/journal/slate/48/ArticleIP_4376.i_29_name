            The
cover editorial argues that we should fear not a strong
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> but rather, a weak <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>. After years of warp-speed growth, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>'s economy
is slowing down. High unemployment could lead to labor unrest and eventually to
political instability at the top. That would be bad news for the rest of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asia</ENAMEX>
and the world. ... A story says reliable voice recognition technology will soon
be a reality. A consortium of high-tech <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Flanders</ENAMEX>--"one of the most
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">multilingual</ENAMEX> places around"--is pioneering voice systems that will make
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">palm</ENAMEX>-top computers even more convenient. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> has invested, foreseeing a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">voice</ENAMEX>-capable Windows operating system. ... A story explains why we
can't tickle ourselves. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Scientists</ENAMEX> theorize that our brains anticipate and
discount sensation we cause ourselves. Why? All the better to recognize
sensation caused by other objects, such as, say, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">poisonous insects crawling</ENAMEX> up
our <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX>.

            The
too-long but hilarious cover essay exposes the ridiculous academic shenanigans
of "queer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">theorists</ENAMEX>." Queer theory <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">luminaries</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Moon</ENAMEX> see sex--preferably unconventional sex--everywhere they look. An
entirely innocent passage from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry James</ENAMEX> (reprinted for us to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> for
ourselves) prompts this from Sedgwick: "[The text] shows how in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">James</ENAMEX> a greater
self-knowledge and a greater acceptance and specificity of homosexual desire
transform this <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-conscious enforcing rhetoric of anality, numbness, and
silence into a much richer, pregnant address to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James</ENAMEX>'s male muse, an
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">invocation</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">fisting-as-Ã©criture</NUMEX>." The essay quotes other superb examples of
horrid academic writing.

            The
cover story goes behind the scenes of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Wrestling</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federation</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WWF</ENAMEX> now admits that pro wrestling is fake--they call it "sports

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cable TV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewers</ENAMEX>. Key to success: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vince McMahon</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WWF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>, has made
