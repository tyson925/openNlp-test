               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Randy</ENAMEX>'s
Wrap-Up
            

            "By the time you read this, I
will already be politically dead." This is the election message <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al D'Amato</ENAMEX>
could send just <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a few short hours</TIMEX> from now. (Or a few regular-size <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX>.) This
would be great for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> but tough on "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">News Quiz</ENAMEX>," already perilously low
on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">favorite targets</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tina Brown</ENAMEX>--gone. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Strom Thurmond</ENAMEX>--could go like that.
(Imagine me snapping my fingers, but in an attractive Italian suit and a better
apartment.) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gwen Verdon</ENAMEX>--that was a freak accident; I'm sick about it. The
trend is clear.

            Consider
cartoons: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom</ENAMEX> needs <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerry</ENAMEX>, Bugs needs <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elmer</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J. Edgar Hoover</ENAMEX> needs decent
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> exercising their political freedoms. Our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foes</ENAMEX> define us. Far more
quiz responses kicked at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">D'Amato</ENAMEX> than at anyone else. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News Quiz</ENAMEX> encouraged
this piling on, but certainly some of it was heartfelt.) What will we do
without him? Sure, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rudy Giuliani</ENAMEX> is drawn to national <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> like a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">flame</ENAMEX>, if the flame is a trash fire or maybe a pile of old tires. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sorry</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">moth</ENAMEX>.) But his fall will be swift and extremely amusing, yet brief. Whom will
we choose who more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">durably</ENAMEX> embodies coldhearted thugishness, a lack of vision,
and a deep contempt for our democratic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX>? Perhaps we need a retreat.
Can we meet <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this weekend</TIMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bohemian Grove</ENAMEX>?

            I don't remember using those
words.

            I don't know.

            I don't remember sending
it.

            Well, how would I know
that?

            I have no idea what those
numbers are.

            I don't remember.

            I really don't know what that
means.

            I have no idea what you're
talking about when you say "ask."

            I don't know.

            I'm not sure.
