            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1895</TIMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edgar Degas</ENAMEX> shipped a camera to his beloved <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marguerite</ENAMEX>, who was dying in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Buenos Aires</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Argentina</ENAMEX>, where she and her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> had fled from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">creditors</ENAMEX>. The
camera, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Degas</ENAMEX> explained, was "capable of both posed and instantaneous views."
With "no more than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a month</TIMEX> of practice," she would be able to send him "a few
good portraits"--including, he specified <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few days later</TIMEX>, "some negatives that
I can have enlarged to see you better." <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Degas</ENAMEX>' enthusiasm for photography can't
conceal the morbid undertow of his request. He will never see her again, but
this camera might get there in time. And the negative--so apt a word in this
context--will assume her place. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Degas</ENAMEX>' pragmatic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of photography
with death recalls <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roland Barthes</ENAMEX>' far more melodramatic one: "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Photography</ENAMEX> may
correspond to the intrusion, in our modern society, of an asymbolic <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Death</ENAMEX>,
outside of religion, outside of ritual, a kind of abrupt dive into literal
Death." <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Degas</ENAMEX> sends no consoling words to his dying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX>, just a camera, and
the hope that she has a month to learn how to use it.

            The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metropolitan Museum of Art</ENAMEX> has assembled the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40 or so</NUMEX> known photographs by
Degas, all dated (with an occasional "probable" added) during the years
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1895-96</TIMEX>. With this show the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metropolitan</ENAMEX> brings to a close an extraordinary
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cycle of Degas</ENAMEX> exhibitions that began with the huge retrospective of 10 years
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ago</TIMEX> and proceeded through such lesser-known materials as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Degas</ENAMEX>' monotypes, his
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">landscapes</ENAMEX>, and his private collection of works by other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX>. The
exhibition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Degas</ENAMEX>' photographs, some of which have never before been seen in
public, raises <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> questions. What sort of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">photographer</ENAMEX> was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Degas</ENAMEX>? And what do
these photographs add to our understanding of him as an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX>?

            You might think photography was perfectly suited to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Degas</ENAMEX>.
By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1870</TIMEX>, when he was in his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-30s</TIMEX>, he had left large-scale historical and
mythological <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> behind for good. No more medieval costume dramas or
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spartan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youths</ENAMEX> flirting in freeze frame. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Degas</ENAMEX> spent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the following decade</TIMEX>
developing an art that reflected the jostling shocks and perpetual motion of
the modern metropolis. Close-ups of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">musicians</ENAMEX> in orchestra pits, with
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ballerinas</ENAMEX> above them, beheaded by the top of the frame. Horses jutting their
heads into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> side of a picture, while carriages are chopped off by the other.
A disheveled dandy, his <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughters</ENAMEX>, and his <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX>, all facing in different
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">directions</ENAMEX> and wedged into one corner of a picture, while the broad expanse of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Place de la Concorde</ENAMEX> takes up the remaining space. Odd <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">croppings</ENAMEX>, odd
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">angles</ENAMEX>, odd encounters. Give that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> a camera.

            It has
often been suggested that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Degas</ENAMEX>' innovative urban <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">perspectives</ENAMEX> were influenced
by photography. But the opposite is closer to the truth. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Degas</ENAMEX>' manipulations
of perspective, decentered <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">compositions</ENAMEX>, and so on were always latent in the
practice of Western <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painters</ENAMEX>; he merely pushed them further than anyone else
had. The peculiar pictures that resulted made the new invention of photography,
and especially the casually composed snapshots of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1890s</TIMEX> and after, seem
less outrageous, more "artful." Ambitious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">photographers</ENAMEX> followed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Degas</ENAMEX>' lead.
But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Degas</ENAMEX> came around to photography as a sort of afterthought.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Degas</ENAMEX> had acquired a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer of 1895</TIMEX>, when he
was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">61</NUMEX>, and he took it along for trips to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">spa</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> and watering holes. The
amateur photography craze was such that fashionable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> provided darkrooms
for vacationing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shutterbugs</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Degas</ENAMEX> took some tricky landscape shots, such as ,
where the curvature of the path and the converging <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> on either side of the
road give the illusion of a dead end, against a migrating wall of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>. Back
in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Degas</ENAMEX> showed no interest in pushing such plein-air experiments
further--he was no <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atget</ENAMEX> in the making. After all, he had already perfected in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pastel</ENAMEX> and paint a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">daytime</TIMEX> art of apparent spontaneity, with precisely the sort
of visual jokes he'd found on that tree-lined <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>. What <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Degas</ENAMEX> discovered in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">photography</ENAMEX> was a nighttime art of stasis and meditative inwardness. "Daylight
is too easy," he insisted. "What I want is difficult--the atmosphere of lamps
and moonlight."

            So he
turned after-dinner <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> into photo shoots, marshaling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guests</ENAMEX> to pose in
carefully orchestrated tableaux. The major surprise of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Degas</ENAMEX>' photographs is
that the theatricality and staginess so resolutely banished from his paintings
flooded into his photographs. At a time when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX> camera and roll film
(first introduced in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1888</TIMEX>) made the instantaneous "snapshot aesthetic"
possible, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Degas</ENAMEX> opted for an older approach: the pose held for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two or three</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX>, the long exposure, the "atmospheric" effects of lamplight on a black
ground. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">A night</TIMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Degas</ENAMEX> and his camera was, according to his close friend
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel Hal√©vy</ENAMEX>, "<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two hours</TIMEX> of military obedience." <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Degas</ENAMEX> knew what he wanted and
would push till he got it. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hal√©vy</ENAMEX> recorded snippets of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Degas</ENAMEX>' imperious orders:
"And you, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mademoiselle Henriette</ENAMEX>, bend your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX>--more--still more. Really bend
it." The twisting , one of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> surviving photographic nudes by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Degas</ENAMEX>,
bends her head so far that it disappears in darkness.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Degas</ENAMEX>' photographic nocturnes evoke a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Halloween</TIMEX> world of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phantasms</ENAMEX> and ghostly intimations, with death often lurking in the shadows. In
, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louise</ENAMEX>, a sort of surrogate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Degas</ENAMEX>, appears to have fallen asleep,
while the lamp to the right blooms like her dream world. In (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Biblioth√</ENAMEX>®que
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nationale</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX>), one of a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">suite</ENAMEX> of self-portraits, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Degas</ENAMEX>' devoted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">housekeeper</ENAMEX>
and cook looms above his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">penseur</ENAMEX> pose, her head the top of a pyramid,
like a muse figure or a protective <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">guardian</ENAMEX>. In the most complex of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Degas</ENAMEX>'
photographs, his great dual portrait of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painter</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Renoir</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poet</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St√©phane Mallarm√©</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum of Modern Art</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Renoir</ENAMEX>'s head is posed dead
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">center</ENAMEX> in the composition, with the vertical of the mirror frame bisecting his
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX>. In the mirror itself <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Degas</ENAMEX>' camera apparatus is visible, but his own head
is obliterated--the flash of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genius</ENAMEX> or the death of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>--by a sunburst
of illumination.

            Despite
his obsessive care in arranging shots, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Degas</ENAMEX> the amateur <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">photographer</ENAMEX> made
mistakes, and some of these led to further discoveries. He preserved some
double exposures of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hal√</ENAMEX>©vy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, with intersecting bodies extending
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">vertically</ENAMEX> and horizontally and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heads</ENAMEX> emerging here and there like ghosts.
Among the most striking images in the show are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> negatives of a ballet
dancer assuming poses familiar from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Degas</ENAMEX>' pastels (see [<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Arm Outstretched</ENAMEX>]).
The glass negatives were too overexposed to print, so <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Degas</ENAMEX> had them treated
with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemicals</ENAMEX> to produce an orange and yellow effect like stained glass,
images for a secular chapel.

            Why did <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Degas</ENAMEX> give up photography so soon after being
captivated by it? Had he "passed through the sadness and grief that accompanied
the death of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> and that helped spur his photographic activity," as the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">curator Malcolm Daniel</ENAMEX> asks in his catalog essay? Well, no, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel</ENAMEX> concedes,
since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Degas</ENAMEX> continued to mourn <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marguerite</ENAMEX> (who died in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late October 1895</TIMEX>), and
other close <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">companions</ENAMEX> died during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years immediately following</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel</ENAMEX>
leans toward a technical explanation--that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Degas</ENAMEX> "had solved the problem of the
meditative lamp-lit nocturnal portrait."

            I would
suggest another cause. Many of those portraits, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over a third</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Degas</ENAMEX>' total
photographic output, were of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hal√</ENAMEX>©vy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>. They were <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Degas</ENAMEX>' closest
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>; he dined with them regularly and treated them, at a time when his own
family was dispersed and in financial trouble, as virtually his own <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX>.
Then came the accusation of treason in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1894</TIMEX> against the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> army <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alfred Dreyfus</ENAMEX>, who happened to be <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX>, and the subsequent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> society into <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nationalists</ENAMEX> convinced of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dreyfus</ENAMEX>' guilt and those
equally convinced of his innocence. Degas was in the former <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camp</ENAMEX>, and by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1895</TIMEX>
would have his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">housekeeper</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zo√</ENAMEX>© read aloud from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-Semitic</ENAMEX> tracts at the
breakfast table. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Two years later</TIMEX>, he could no longer tolerate any association
with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX>, including the thoroughly assimilated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hal√©vys.</ENAMEX> As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel Hal√</ENAMEX>©vy
reported, "An almost unbelievable thing happened in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">autumn of 1897</TIMEX>. Our
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">long-standing</ENAMEX> friendship with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Degas</ENAMEX>, which on our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>'s side went back to
their childhood, was broken off."

            The art <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">historian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Linda Nochlin</ENAMEX> has traced what she calls
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Degas</ENAMEX>' "perfectly ordinary" anti-Semitism to status anxiety. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Degas</ENAMEX> family
(which sometimes changed their name to "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">de Gas</ENAMEX>" to suggest noble roots) came to
prominence through the same international banking connections the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jewish</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">financiers</ENAMEX> they deplored had. When his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> fell on hard times, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Degas</ENAMEX> blamed
it on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX>. One wonders whether the dark and shadowy world of his
photographs might have had some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> in his mind with the ambivalence he
felt toward the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> he posed in such excruciating positions. Degas, according
to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel Hal√©vy</ENAMEX>, "carried his camera as proudly as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> carrying a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rifle</ENAMEX>."

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dreyfus</ENAMEX> case is all but
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unmentioned</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metropolitan</ENAMEX> show and catalog. The oversight is not the
result of an effort to avoid downbeat or offensive sides of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Degas</ENAMEX>, but rather a
failure to understand the seismic shift in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> society caused by
"<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">l'affaire</TIMEX> ." <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Photography</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> nationalism were also linked in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Degas</ENAMEX>' mind. As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel Hal√©vy</ENAMEX> wrote in his diary about a visit with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Degas</ENAMEX> in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December of 1895</TIMEX>, "We went out; he talked about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>, about photography,
about photography, about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>, all mixed together with equal excitement."
When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Degas</ENAMEX> walked out on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hal√</ENAMEX>©vy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, he walked out on photography as
well.
