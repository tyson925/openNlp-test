               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Randy</ENAMEX>'s
Wrap-Up
            

            Is it
possible to make a joke about an offensive remark without making an offensive
remark? Tricky. Perhaps more than anything else, context counts. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lenny Bruce</ENAMEX>
built a routine around the idea that repeating the word "nigger" over and over
and over very, very fast could strip it of its cruel power, reducing it to an
impotent sound. But the context was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce</ENAMEX>'s entire life. The risk is falling
into the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Cops and Firemen</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blackface Defense</ENAMEX>. When these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fellows</ENAMEX> were caught
on tape (a delightfully <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dick Clarkish</ENAMEX> phrase) on an appallingly racist parade
float, they pleaded satire. Here the context is the history of the New York
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Police</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fire</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">departments</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> traditionally short on anti-racist
parodists, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commissioners</ENAMEX> of both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> gave these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> the boot.
(This, of course, raises <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">First Amendment</ENAMEX> questions about odious speech, but
that's another question.) So where does that leave "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">News Quiz"</ENAMEX>? Just a little
uneasy. But not wallowing in a moral swamp, like those cringing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">thieves</ENAMEX> at
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time magazine</ENAMEX>. And that's a comfort.

             

            
               Se√±or
Answer
            

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanic</ENAMEX> New
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Yorkers</ENAMEX>.

            The remark: "You don't stand
outside a bodega and ask the bandito if he would have killed someone if there
was a death penalty."

            The context: replying to a
question about the ineffable deterrent value of the death penalty.

            The denial: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vacco</ENAMEX> admits to
"bodega," refutes "bandito."

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">source</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rob Goldblum</ENAMEX>,
managing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jewish Week</ENAMEX> .

            The other admission: Vacco
acknowledged that he was virtually guilty of murdering <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Buffalo</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barnett</ENAMEX>
Slepian, "just as if I'd pulled the trigger myself."

            Correction: No, he didn't. He
takes no responsibility whatever.

            His
election <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponent</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eliot Spitzer</ENAMEX> recalls that when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vacco</ENAMEX> was a federal
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecutor</ENAMEX> he was so egregiously lax in protecting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">abortion clinics</ENAMEX> that he was
removed from a case by a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Buffalo</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> and replaced with a special
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecutor</ENAMEX>.
