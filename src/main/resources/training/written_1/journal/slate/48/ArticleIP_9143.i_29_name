               Not OK,
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oklahoma</ENAMEX>
            

            In the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Nov. 20</TIMEX> "Give It
Back to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Injuns</ENAMEX>," an unbalanced and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">frothing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Plotz</ENAMEX> refers to
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oklahoma</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> as "a top to bottom roster of kooks, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">losers</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">terrors</ENAMEX>."

            Is this responsible
journalism? Would you permit <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX> to be vilified in similar name-calling?
Does this really elevate civil discourse in a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> in which reasonable minds
should be free to disagree? Or is it just brain-dead demagoguery?

            Sometimes

                  Slate
                appears to favor totalitarian intolerance of conservative
thought. Could you provide some basic instruction to your "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalists</ENAMEX>" on the
left about minimum civility and respect for those with whom they disagree?

Speaking
            

            Re the extraordinary and
articulate article "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Give It Back to the Injuns</ENAMEX>": If only we <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Oklahomans</ENAMEX> were
less genially mediocre, we'd probably be more appreciative of your ability to
slap the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">faces</ENAMEX> of so many different <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oklahomans</ENAMEX> all at the same time
and in such a charming way. I'm a male <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Caucasian</ENAMEX>, am not inclined to consider
myself a "religious" or even a "<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX>" <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>, and am a 55-year-old
registered <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrat</ENAMEX> (having switched <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX> after having been a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">registered Republican</ENAMEX> all the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> before and mainly because of the present
influence of the so-called religious right in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Republican Party</ENAMEX>). So, I'm
less genial than some of my <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oklahoma</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kinfolk</ENAMEX>, even if I share in the mediocrity
you sweepingly attribute to those of us who live within this portion of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX>.

            You are quick, and apparently
presume you have the status, to give away and to disrespect at the same time.
Now, had you not managed to be so sweepingly offensive to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Native Americans</ENAMEX>,
too, by your disrespectful use of the deprecatory term "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Injun</ENAMEX>" (your momma
should spank your bottom and put a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lifebuoy</ENAMEX> in your mouth), you might at
least have picked up a few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">admirers</ENAMEX> within these borders, given the thesis
implied by the title to your article. Indeed, many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Native Americans</ENAMEX> would
welcome a return of their land, including that small piece of terrain that you
presumably have sufficient mass to be able to occupy. But, as it is, you come
off as just another self-appointed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">jerk</ENAMEX> who appears to write articles mainly
for the pleasure of seeing his name and opinions in print, instead of being a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> who uses words to persuade rather than to malign.

            As I said,
I'm sometimes less genial than my fellow <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Oklahomans</ENAMEX>, so I trust that you will
not take these remarks as a reflection upon their general temperament.

               Pregnant
Logic
            

            From the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Nov. 23</TIMEX> "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Today's Papers":</ENAMEX>

            The WP front covers
a lawsuit in which a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> is suing a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> for becoming pregnant against his
will--she had, he says, promised to take birth control <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pills</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> claims
that she became pregnant accidentally. That factual issue may be settled at
trial, but it seems that there is a larger legal issue well worth addressing.
Since court findings of paternity cost the imputed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fathers</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eighteen years</TIMEX>'
worth of support, it seems only fair that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> be held accountable for any
promises they make about attempting to remain childless. In the absence of
that, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>'s promise to take charge of birth control and then not doing so
remains the only form of monetary fraud <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Today's Papers</ENAMEX> can think of that is not
only not punished, but is in fact regularly rewarded.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grrr</ENAMEX>. I'm sure that by now
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> have written in to snarl at your reproductive tort
theories. I object to your logic for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> reasons: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) Birth control methods do,
in fact, fail on occasion. Even <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vasectomies</ENAMEX> fail. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Men</ENAMEX> who don't want their
sexual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> to become pregnant are responsible for taking steps themselves
to prevent pregnancy. Sex without a condom is not an inalienable right of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Men</ENAMEX> who participate in
creating an unwanted pregnancy should do a bit more than whine about how "she
was taking care of it." That tone goes over better for chiding the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> who
forgot to bring the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beer</ENAMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> football.

            As always,
though, great column, despite our difference of opinion in sexual politics.

the boring shtick, will ya? <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> is bored with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX> hearings ("<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A Starr Is</ENAMEX>

                  Slate
               's new strategy to grab
current and prospective <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX>? I hope not, because I'm bored with their
boredom. Sure, the hearing and the trial may be a bit slow, but these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX>
are covering something important or else they wouldn't be there. And if they
are bored silly covering such events the traditional way, they should get off
their butts and try talking to someone different and exploring something
new.
