               According to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Houston</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">psychiatrist Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Krueger</ENAMEX>, "Part of the reason so many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> take these
types of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> is that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> tend to have trouble admitting they have a problem."

naturally vary in both quality and quantity. Fill in the blank, for example,
typically sparks the most responses. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX>'s question generated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only about half</NUMEX>
the usual returns, and here's why: It's not very good. And here's whose fault
it is: <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mine</ENAMEX>. Devising the question calls for the deft and tactful art of the
straight <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>, for playing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Burns</ENAMEX> to your <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gracie Allen</ENAMEX>. It's not just a
matter of lobbing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> over the plate for you to hit out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>. It's
putting <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> over the plate that, when you clobber it, erupts in a shower of
confetti that coalesces into a single <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">scarlet flamingo</ENAMEX> that flies over to the
box seats and bites <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Steinbrenner</ENAMEX> on the ass. But not <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>.

            The drug
metaphor is opaque and clumsy. And the central premise invites the too-familiar
gender-wars responses. Plus, there is something uncomfortable about male
admissions of inadequacy; it's like pleading guilty to a burglary so you won't
get nailed for a murder. Incidentally, the most common response was, as many of
you suspected, jokes about <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>'s reluctance to ask for directions. However,
we've declined to run such observations out of respect for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerry Seinfeld</ENAMEX>. And
again, it's all my fault for leading you into this swamp. I'll try to do better
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX>. And I'll never again use a manly baseball metaphor. (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Picture me</ENAMEX>
humbly not spitting.)

            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Lifestyle drugs</ENAMEX>.

            As
distinguished from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicines</ENAMEX> that relieve pain or cure <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX>, many <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> in
this category have failed to meet financial expectations. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Drugs</ENAMEX> to promote hair
growth (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Propecia</ENAMEX>) and to stop smoking (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nicotrol</ENAMEX>) have had disappointing sales.
With the exception of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Viagra</ENAMEX> (with projected <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">first year</TIMEX> returns of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">up to $1</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">billion</ENAMEX>, the most successful drug rollout in history), <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> have been a harder
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sell</ENAMEX> than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, who buy <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60 percent</NUMEX> of the top <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> anti-smoking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Men</ENAMEX>
tend to abandon such remedies if they're not immediately effective.

said: 'If you leverage your <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Germanness</ENAMEX>, that's really potent for this

a good advertising strategy for the Wehrmacht
            

            "I can smile, but it's
hard to think about whether that stereotype is realistic. As long as you, as a
