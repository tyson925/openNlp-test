   
   
      
         
            Is <A NAME=

            Gambling's would-be
federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX>--the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Gambling Impact Study Commission</ENAMEX>--went to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vegas</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</TIMEX> to hold hearings. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dispatch</ENAMEX>, we learn how gambling's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foes</ENAMEX> seek to demonize wagering as a
pernicious tobaccolike vice. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dispatch</ENAMEX>, gambling's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foes</ENAMEX> learn the folly of having brought their anti-sin
crusade to an adult <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Disneyland</ENAMEX>.

            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX>'s overpowering show
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nevada</ENAMEX> gambling aristocracy has had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> audible effect
on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Gambling Impact Study Commission</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX>, even commission
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chair Kay Coles James</ENAMEX>, a gambling skeptic, succumbs to the hideous <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vegas</ENAMEX>
euphemism: She begins referring to the "gaming industry."

            After
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">casino</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">triumphalism</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> is a comedown, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">eight hours</TIMEX> of policy
panels on teen gambling, compulsive gambling, gambling regulation, gambling
marketing, and gambling credit practices. It is tough slogging, but for the
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time I sense that this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">commission</ENAMEX>--though divided, underfunded, timid,
and without any power beyond exhortation--isn't entirely useless. It may
finally settle this question: Is gambling <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tobacco</ENAMEX>? Entertainment
or vice?

            The sleek <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vegas</ENAMEX> types, whose <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Strip</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palaces</ENAMEX> scramble
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">casinos</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">theaters</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arcades</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">discos</ENAMEX>, cabarets, theme <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX>, concert
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">halls</ENAMEX>, sports <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">arenas</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX> into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> giant orgy of amusement, have been
selling the idea that gambling is just entertainment--<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Disney</ENAMEX> in the desert.
This effort has largely succeeded, because <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vegas</ENAMEX> is still the dominant image of
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> gambling, if not the dominant reality.

            The antis,
meanwhile, cry that gambling is like cigarettes: unsafe for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>, viciously
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">addictive</ENAMEX>, deceptively marketed, unhealthy, expensive, and unacceptable unless
mightily regulated.

            
Judging by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s hearings and by
conversations with most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commissioners</ENAMEX>, the tobacco model is winning.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">panelists</ENAMEX> tell the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">commission</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> are starting to gamble too
young and are getting addicted too easily, that compulsive gambling appears to
be increasing as gambling spreads, that gambling marketing may be designed to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">addict customers</ENAMEX>, and that the industry exploits problem <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gamblers</ENAMEX> by allowing
them to draw repeated credit card advances from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATMs</ENAMEX> on casino floors. The
testimony clearly impresses the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commissioners</ENAMEX> and seems especially to impress
the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> nonaligned <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commissioners</ENAMEX> who will be the swing votes on the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 1999</TIMEX>
report.

            It is
starting to become clear what that report will say. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">commission</ENAMEX> won't (and
can't) take any grand stand against gambling. Instead it will opt for small,
targeted policies, concentrating on compulsive gambling. It will probably
propose that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">casinos</ENAMEX> and state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lotteries fund</ENAMEX> gambling-addiction research and
that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">casinos</ENAMEX> take much stronger measures to bar problem <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gamblers</ENAMEX> from wagering.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">commission</ENAMEX> may recommend that gaming taxes be used to underwrite treatment
of pathological <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gamblers</ENAMEX> and that insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> be encouraged to cover
gambling addiction. Similarly, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">commission</ENAMEX> will try to reduce <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gamblers</ENAMEX>'
access to cash by limiting the size of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATM</ENAMEX> advances and prodding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">casinos</ENAMEX> to
remove the machines from their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floors</ENAMEX>.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">commission</ENAMEX> will also push the industry to do more to
prevent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> from gambling. It will call for heavier regulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indian</ENAMEX>
gambling and will probably try to ban or severely regulate Internet gambling,
perhaps by forbidding gambling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> from running online <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">casinos</ENAMEX>. It will
rebuke state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lotteries</ENAMEX> for their deceptive marketing and will try to force them
to post odds and stop targeting the poor. In short, it will treat gambling as a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tobaccolike</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice</ENAMEX>.

            If the
comments of the pro-industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commissioners</ENAMEX> can be believed, the industry will
happily endorse such a report. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gamblers</ENAMEX> don't quite accept the cigarette
analogy--though commission <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Bible</ENAMEX>, a former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nevada</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gaming Commission</ENAMEX>, did concede that gambling was like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX>--but they're
happy to sign on to the specific measures. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">casino</ENAMEX> industry is even trying
to get ahead of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">commission</ENAMEX>. It has already established a (mostly)
independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">center</ENAMEX> to fund research into pathological gambling. I suspect that
the industry will not only agree to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">commission</ENAMEX>'s recommendations but will
become their strongest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocate</ENAMEX>. Casino <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> will avidly lobby <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> and
state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">legislatures</ENAMEX> to enact the recommendations into law.

            
Why should the pro-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gamblers</ENAMEX> cooperate with a
critical study? Because it provides superb cover for them. It medicalizes the
problem of compulsive gambling, blaming it on psychological abnormality rather
than industry machination. Likewise, cracking down on compulsives is also
politically cost-effective. In exchange for losing a few compulsive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gamblers</ENAMEX>,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">casinos</ENAMEX> will (falsely) appear more concerned with the health of their
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> than with profits.

            The
cigarette agenda will also distract the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">commission</ENAMEX> and the public from the true
reasons for worry. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A few years ago</TIMEX>, gambling was confined to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Vegas</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Atlantic City</ENAMEX>. It is now thriving in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, and there is no sign that
anyone can stop it. In this election, gambling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">interests</ENAMEX> dropped <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$100 million</NUMEX>
on a single <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> ballot initiative, toppled <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governors</ENAMEX> in two
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, and bought <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senators</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> by the crate. What the
commission ought to be investigating is whether the gambling industry has
become so powerful that it's politically untouchable. But it can't, because the
gambling industry has become so powerful that it's politically untouchable.

            The antis can call gambling "<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tobacco</ENAMEX>." They can call it
"<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice</ENAMEX>." They can call it "a big red <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">balloon</ENAMEX>" for all that the industry cares.
As long as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">commission</ENAMEX> just nibbles around the edges, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">casino</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operators</ENAMEX>
and state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lotteries</ENAMEX> will be happy to indulge it. The pro-gambling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">folks</ENAMEX> will
win credit for cooperating, without having to do anything that really hurts.
The last national gambling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">commission</ENAMEX> was in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-1970s</TIMEX>. If the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gamblers</ENAMEX>
play along with this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">commission</ENAMEX>'s timid recommendations, they'll be safe for
another <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20 years</TIMEX>.

            
               An
Apology
            

            I owe an
apology to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nevada</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Bryan</ENAMEX>, whom I criticized <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> for using the
term "<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> country" during a speech critical of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">casinos</ENAMEX>. As several
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> pointed out to me, "<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> country" is a common phrase in the West and
has no derogatory connotations. I'm sorry, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Senator</ENAMEX>.

            Talk about quick defeats:
The first sign I see outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGM Grand</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ballroom</ENAMEX> all but declares that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Gambling Impact Study Commission</ENAMEX> has already lost. The sign reads:
"<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Gaming Impact Study Commission</ENAMEX>."

            
               "Gaming"?
            

            In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vegas</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the euphemizers</TIMEX> reign. Once upon a time, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">casino</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> decided that
"gambling" was too crude, too avaricious, to describe their fair business. So
"gambling" disappeared in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Vegas</ENAMEX>, and "gaming" has risen in its place. He
who controls language controls ideas, and at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s commission hearing, it is
perfectly clear who controls the language. Video slot machines crammed into
convenience <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX>--perhaps the most pernicious form of legal gambling there
is--are called "retail gaming." <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> who own <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">casinos</ENAMEX> are not "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">casino</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX>,"
they are "gaming <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visionaries</ENAMEX>." Pathological <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gamblers</ENAMEX> are "problem gamers"--as
if they're having trouble mastering the rules of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monopoly</ENAMEX>. And the National
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gambling Impact Study Commission</ENAMEX> is reborn as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Gaming Impact Study</ENAMEX>
Commission.

            The gambling industry did everything in its power to stop
the establishment of this commission <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years ago</TIMEX>, but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> and a fervent
grassroots anti-gambling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> eventually foisted it on the industry. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX>
member blue-ribbon <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> was charged with assessing the social and economic
impact of gambling, and it will issue a final report to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 1999</TIMEX>. Even though the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> was carefully balanced between
pro- and anti-gambling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX>, it was supposed to be <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vegas</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">nemesis</ENAMEX>. The
industry and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Vegas</ENAMEX>' pro-gambling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> quaked in anticipation of the
onerous regulations and taxes the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">commission</ENAMEX> might recommend.

            But they quake no more.
Whatever national momentum the anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gamblers</ENAMEX> had dissolved in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX>'s
elections. The industry routed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponents</ENAMEX> in state after state. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Missouri</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX>
passed a ballot initiative to allow boat <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">casinos</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Californians</ENAMEX> voted to expand
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">casinos</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Carolina</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alabama</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> expelled anti-lottery,
anti-gambling <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governors</ENAMEX> and replaced them with pro-lottery
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX>. The gambling industry spent <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $100 million</NUMEX> on political
contributions and issue ads. It has never been fatter, happier, or more
secure.

            "My
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">goodness</ENAMEX>, no <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politician</ENAMEX> can withstand their resources," <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Focus on the Family</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Dobson</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">commission</ENAMEX>'s leading gambling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">opponent</ENAMEX>, tells me. The
industry's political clout has emasculated the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">commission</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dobson</ENAMEX> continues:
"Our report won't be acted on by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>. They are too
heavily influenced by gambling money. Almost all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> are on
the dole." It has also become obvious that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">commission</ENAMEX> has too many
pro-gambling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">members</ENAMEX> to produce a report that recommends taxes or other real
penalties on the industry.

            
So the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">commission</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two day</TIMEX> visit to Gomorrah
has been transformed from a charged political event to a kind of victory lap
for gaming. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nevada</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gov.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Miller</ENAMEX> and the "gaming <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visionaries</ENAMEX>" have been
planning for these hearings for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX>, hoping to use them to demonstrate the
might and sanctity and goodness of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nevada</ENAMEX> gambling industry.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGM</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grand</ENAMEX>, which is run by commission <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Terrence Lanni</ENAMEX>, is itself the first
exhibit of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vegas</ENAMEX> triumphalists. It is gaudy testimony that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX>, at
least, have no problem with this business. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGM Grand</ENAMEX>, a k a "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The City</ENAMEX> of
Entertainment," has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX>--the corridor outside my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">200 yards</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">long</ENAMEX>, so long I can't see its end--to feed the endless supply of slot machines,
craps tables, and roulette wheels. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Cassidy</ENAMEX> performs here every
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>--twice! A few steps outside on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Strip</ENAMEX> is still more overwhelming
evidence that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Vegas</ENAMEX> has won the popular vote. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> is just
across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1.6 billion</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bellagio</ENAMEX> is one door down, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a half</NUMEX>-scale
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Eiffel Tower</ENAMEX> is going up next door. The setting has, as the pro-gambling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">folks</ENAMEX>
no doubt hoped, stunned some of the gambling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">opponents</ENAMEX>. I asked one
anti-gambling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activist</ENAMEX> who had never before been to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vegas</ENAMEX> what she thinks of
it. She could only blurt out "Wow."

            The hearings, too, reinforce the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Glorious Las Vegas</ENAMEX> theme.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Fahrenkopf</ENAMEX>, the industry's top <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lobbyist</ENAMEX> (who is paid so much he can
afford monogrammed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shirt cuffs</ENAMEX> --I saw them), holds forth cheerfully
outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ballroom</ENAMEX>, celebrating the electoral triumph of freedom over
religious moralist tyranny. Inside, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> is packed with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 600</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in neon lime green T-shirts that read "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Unions</ENAMEX> and Gaming: Together for a
Better <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Life</ENAMEX>." They are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">casino union</ENAMEX>, here to cheer on
their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employers</ENAMEX> and their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">union</ENAMEX>. (Most of them, it must be said, are getting
paid to do this.)

            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Chairwoman</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kay Coles James</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conservative</ENAMEX> and skeptic of gambling, opens the
hearing by assuring the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committee</ENAMEX> is toothless: "We're not here
to take anyone's job. ... We have no power to do anything except make
recommendations." This sets the mood for most of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vegas</ENAMEX> is great, so
you'd better leave it alone! The local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>, by all appearances a wholly
owned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">subsidiary</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">casinos</ENAMEX>, puts on a bravura performance. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gov.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miller</ENAMEX>
opens the show with a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15 minute</TIMEX> hymn to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Vegas</ENAMEX>. It is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of many
statistical barrages about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nevada</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-ders: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">No. 1</NUMEX> in job growth, No. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> in
population growth, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">No. 1</NUMEX> on planet <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX> in per capita <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Girl Scout</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX>--and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boy Scout</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX>!

            
Later in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nevada</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senators</ENAMEX> and both
its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">congressmen</ENAMEX> appear to chew out the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">commission</ENAMEX> for even thinking that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nevada</ENAMEX>
might have a dark side. They pay tribute to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nevada</ENAMEX>'s sophisticated gambling
industry, especially its regulation (much stricter than other gambling <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>)
and its use of gambling taxes to fund state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">services</ENAMEX>. It is one of the ironies
of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nevada</ENAMEX> politics that its <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">congressmen</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Gibbons</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">John</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ensign</ENAMEX>) end up crediting their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>'s success to government regulation and
corporate taxation.

            There are
also a fair share of gleeful gambling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX>, bookmakers, and casino
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> among the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panels</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert witnesses</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">commission</ENAMEX> hears from.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Critics</ENAMEX> who gripe about the perils of sports gambling and the evils of
convenience <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX> slot machines leaven the pro-gambling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">folks</ENAMEX>. Everyone,
including the gambling industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shills</ENAMEX>, agrees that Internet gambling is evil
and should be destroyed. Everyone agrees to this because no one in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Vegas</ENAMEX> is
making any money off Internet gambling. If they were, you can be sure they
would explain why it's as <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nickel slots</ENAMEX> and scratch-off games.

            Pro-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vegas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> are also perfectly happy to take shots at
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indian</ENAMEX> gambling, the chief economic threat to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nevada</ENAMEX>'s prosperity. The
expansion of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">casinos</ENAMEX> resulting from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> voter
initiative will slam <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Vegas</ENAMEX>, cutting its gambling revenues by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$400 million</NUMEX> a
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>. So the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Vegans</ENAMEX> repeatedly swing at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">casinos</ENAMEX> in "<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> country" (that's
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nevada</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Bryan</ENAMEX>'s term--I'm not joking) for being insufficiently
regulated and taxed. One tribal chief I spoke to calls this "red baiting."

            (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pause</ENAMEX> for an aesthetic
observation: I am sitting right behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witnesses</ENAMEX>, and after a while I begin
to separate them into the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Wides and the Narrows</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wides</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> in suits
with enormous backs and enormous bellies, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> who eat and eat and used to play
<ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">football</ENAMEX>. They all testify to their love of gambling. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Narrows</ENAMEX> are thin and
generally disapprove of it. I begin to wonder whether fondness for gambling
correlates with general indulgence, and dislike correlates with asceticism, and
decide that they probably do.)

            During the
last <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hour of the day</TIMEX>, the public comment period, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">union</ENAMEX> sends a parade of
casino <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> to the microphone to hallelujah the gaming industry.
Housekeepers, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cooks</ENAMEX>, and slot change girls, almost all black or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Latina</ENAMEX>, tell
the same story: I was working a dead-end job in another <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, "then I heard
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Vegas</ENAMEX>, where there's opportunity!" I moved here, landed a job at a
union <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">casino</ENAMEX> with high pay, free medical insurance, a pension, and "now I am
buying a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>." The stories are intensely moving, by far the most persuasive
tribute to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Strip</ENAMEX> that I've ever heard.

            
Still, for all the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vegan</ENAMEX> triumphalism in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">air</ENAMEX>, it's impossible not to be charmed by the chief gambling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">opponent</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rev.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Grey</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grey</ENAMEX> is utterly irrepressible. A <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vietnam</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rifleman</ENAMEX> turned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Methodist</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minister</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grey</ENAMEX> has spent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last eight years</TIMEX> evangelizing against gambling. He
founded the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Coalition Against Legalized Gambling</ENAMEX>, the primary force
behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">commission</ENAMEX>'s creation. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grey</ENAMEX>, in a rare acknowledgement of defeat,
has just renamed it the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Coalition Against Gambling Expansion</ENAMEX>, tacitly
recognizing that gambling is here to stay.) He is a genial motormouth and
shameless <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> of the cause. He wears a gigantic "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CasiNO</ENAMEX>" button in the
casino. He posed for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> in a shepherd's robe. He says "I would do
anything short of lighting myself on fire in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Capitol</ENAMEX> rotunda to stop
gambling." He is so excitable that I have to yank him out of the way of an
oncoming car when he gets too wrapped up in one of his soliloquies.

            He and his <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Vegas</ENAMEX> allies,
a former <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Vegas</ENAMEX> city <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">councilman</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Miller</ENAMEX> and an inner city venture
capitalist named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Otis Harris</ENAMEX>, invite me on a tour of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Vegas</ENAMEX>. "Behind the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mirage</ENAMEX>," they call it. For <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two hours</TIMEX>, we cruise the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">casinos</ENAMEX>.
They show me all the evidence of gambling blight you'd never want to see, from
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youth</ENAMEX>-center-turned-crack-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX> to pawn <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> to sex <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> to down at heels
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">casinos</ENAMEX> to quickie <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">motels</ENAMEX>. All the while, they keep up a patter about how
terrible a neighbor the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">casino</ENAMEX> industry is and how superficial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Vegas</ENAMEX>'
prosperity is.

            It's very
grim and mostly persuasive. Still, when we turn back on to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Strip</ENAMEX>, and pass
the jaw-dropping <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stratosphere</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Circus Circus</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bellagio</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGM</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grand</ENAMEX>--a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> story <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> bathed in fabulous emerald light, I realize why <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grey</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">task</ENAMEX> is hopeless here. He is committing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cardinal</ENAMEX> sin of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vegas</ENAMEX>. All he wants
to do is talk about losers. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Vegas</ENAMEX>, under the thrilling lights of the
Strip, no one wants to hear about losers. In the land of gaming, not
gambling, everyone is sure he's a winner.
