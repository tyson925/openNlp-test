            The
cover editorial claims that recent market volatility
shouldn't cause large <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> to fear risk. Such risk-aversion would provoke
a recession. Instead, financial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX> should keep more capital to guard against
market upheaval. If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX> "all start to reduce their risks simultaneously, it
might trigger a vicious liquidity-draining cycle." ... A piece says
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cockfighting</ENAMEX> is on its last legs. The vicious sport (razors are tied to the
feet of battling <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">roosters</ENAMEX>) is still legal in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> but may soon be

national <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">program</ENAMEX> covered "Area <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">51</TIMEX>, the real messages of crop circles, the

            A special
issue on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX> of sports. A story frets that media <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">giants</ENAMEX>' purchases of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sports</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> will change the way games are played. Who'll stop <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fox</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owner</ENAMEX> of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los Angeles Dodgers</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Disney</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anaheim Angels</ENAMEX>), and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Warner</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Braves</ENAMEX>) from forcing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">star athletes</ENAMEX> to play when it will boost ratings on their
own <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> or from altering rules to make sports more TV friendly? ...
Several stories explore fan loyalty. In one, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baltimore Orioles</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fans</ENAMEX> sound off
to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owner</ENAMEX>, demanding cheaper tickets and more dedicated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX> (the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owner</ENAMEX> is noncommittal). In another, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Knicks</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fan</ENAMEX> complains that her
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">courtside</ENAMEX> seats have shot up in price even as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> declines. ...
Other stories profile a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">superagent</ENAMEX> winning mammoth contracts for his baseball
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">player clients</ENAMEX>, a rookie <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">quarterback</ENAMEX> learning how to play the endorsements
game, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Commissioner</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Stern</ENAMEX>, who micromanages the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">league</ENAMEX>'s image,

               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> 's education cover package says <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> should get their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>
reading at an early <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX>, be involved in their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>, not castigate them for
mistakes, let them find their own learning styles, and "praise hard work and
persistence--not just outcomes." <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> 's package backlashes against
recent articles ( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The New Yorker</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek</ENAMEX> ) suggesting that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> matter little in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>'s upbringing. An accompanying piece grades the "multiple intelligences" movement. MI
argues that intelligence takes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> forms: musical, logical-mathematical,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">linguistic</ENAMEX>, spatial, bodily, intrapersonal, and interpersonal. The theory is
not backed by hard science, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">MI</ENAMEX>-based curricula often seem like time

package compares <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Watergate</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Flytrap</ENAMEX>. A piece claims that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX>
Flytrap proceedings lack the solemnity of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Watergate</ENAMEX>--they have "all the
grandeur of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ft. Lauderdale</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">spring</TIMEX> break"--and notes that the vote for the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX> inquiry was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">410</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, not the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">256-178</ENAMEX> tally for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinton</ENAMEX> inquiry. A
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> article traces <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary Clinton</ENAMEX>'s progression from
there to here. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary</ENAMEX> worked on the impeachment case against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX>, while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bill</ENAMEX>
used <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Watergate</ENAMEX> as an issue in his failed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1974</TIMEX> congressional campaign. Now the
