Schröder for failing to control his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schröder</ENAMEX>'s campaign platform
was vague, and since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the September</TIMEX> election his leadership has been even
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vaguer</ENAMEX>. Without direction, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>'s economy will soon stall, and its foreign
policy will be confused and ineffective. ... A story says Ivy League <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">universities</ENAMEX> may soon begin a price
