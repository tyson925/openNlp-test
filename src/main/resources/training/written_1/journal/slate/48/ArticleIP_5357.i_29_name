                  Dear
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudence</ENAMEX>,
               
            

            
               The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">confluence of the Slate</ENAMEX> toothpaste article 
               and a recent event has inspired me
to write. I have lived outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> for quite some time now and am
not at all up on current <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> manners. Recently, a visiting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. State</ENAMEX>
Department <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> flossed at the table after dinner in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX>. Is this
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">now</TIMEX> accepted hygienic behavior in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">States</ENAMEX>, or is it as undiplomatic as it
looked to me?
            

            
               --Not a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diplomat</ENAMEX>
Overseas
            

            Dear Not
A,

            You will be relieved to know
that quality <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> have kept flossing a private ritual.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudie</ENAMEX> would not even do it in front of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Beloved</ENAMEX>, let alone at a restaurant
table. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudie</ENAMEX> even retires to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ladies</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> to use her gold toothpick.)

            It is a
safe bet that your <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> is in no danger of being given an
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ambassadorship</ENAMEX>. Your take on his behavior was correct: It was gauche .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudie</ENAMEX> does have one slight bit of curiosity about the faux pas. Did he whip
out the little white <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plastic</ENAMEX> thing that holds the floss, or was he using one of
those ready-to-go saw instruments that look like a cello bow for a doll
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">house</ENAMEX>?

            --<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudie</ENAMEX>, flossily

            
               
                  Dear
Prudie,
               
            

            
               I feel like a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fool</ENAMEX>. A
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> went out for a drink after work, and sitting at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX> was a
real stunner: a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> foot blonde with a fabulous face and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">figure</ENAMEX> to match. I
struck up a conversation with her and was greatly annoyed when one of my
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> insisted I interrupt the conversation to go have a word with
him.
            

            
               He got
me away from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX> and told me the beauteous blonde was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX>. I felt like a
moron for not being able to figure this out myself. Of course the teasing has
not abated, and the weight of my imaginary dunce cap is giving me a headache.
Any thoughts?

            Dear
Dim,

            Prudie
wants you to immediately regain your sense of humor and be grateful that your
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pal</ENAMEX> stepped in before any, uh, harm was done. It is sometimes difficult to
determine if it's real or if it's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Memorex</ENAMEX>, though build, voice, and the hint of
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">beard</ENAMEX> can sometimes be a tip-off. To defend yourself against the teasing
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> and to show that you, too, can see the humor, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudie</ENAMEX> offers a fun <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Latin</ENAMEX>
saying you might share with your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buddies</ENAMEX>: "Dumbassus! Hottie iste
transvestitus! " Meaning roughly, "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Fool</ENAMEX>! That gorgeous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> is a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross</ENAMEX>-dresser!" <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudie</ENAMEX>'s betting you will, in the future, pay closer attention
to knockout <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ladies</ENAMEX> in public places.

            --<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudie</ENAMEX>, cautiously

            
               
                  Dear
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudence</ENAMEX>,
               
            

            
               Your
answer to the fishy question was imprudent, I think. In your response, you
used the word "floundered." Now if you meant that to be a pun, then I have no
problem with it, but if, instead, you meant that you failed, the better word
might have been "foundered," meaning that you a) failed completely or b) went
directly to the bottom. You will of course make the final decision, which will
be prudent in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end</TIMEX>, or prudence at work, whatever!
            

            
               --Cordially yours, I
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">amCarl</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Simpsonville</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">S.C.</ENAMEX>
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carl</ENAMEX>, you
devil you,

            Such
wonderful wordplay just to respond to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">trout</ENAMEX> letter comments. Your first
supposition was right: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudie</ENAMEX> was punning. It was the least she could do.

            --<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudie</ENAMEX>, admiringly

            
               
                  Dear
Prudie,
               
            

            
               I am
the product of perhaps too permissive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> in that they believed, being
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the '60s</TIMEX>, that excessive discipline and training may lead to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stunted</ENAMEX> personality development in their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>. As a result, I have no solid
knowledge of basic etiquette. Can you recommend a general text that is current,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comprehensive</ENAMEX>, and for my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>' sake, progressive?
            

            
               --<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B.H.</ENAMEX>
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dear B.</ENAMEX>,

            Prudie
salutes you for knowing what you do not know and concurs that a world without
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">etiquette</ENAMEX> is a less lovely <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudie</ENAMEX>'s suggestion would be to wander into a
good bookstore, online or actual, and select the most appropriate book by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Letitia Baldridge</ENAMEX>. She is both progressive and proper, having made it her
business to keep up with the times.

            --<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudie</ENAMEX>, politely
