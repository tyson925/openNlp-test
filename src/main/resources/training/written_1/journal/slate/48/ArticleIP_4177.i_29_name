            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">This week</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>
went to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> to raise campaign money for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Schumer</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">N.Y.</ENAMEX>, who
is running for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Senate</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schumer</ENAMEX>, who sits on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Judiciary</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Committee</ENAMEX>, voted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX> not to launch a broad impeachment inquiry against
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>. Now that the inquiry has begun, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schumer</ENAMEX> eventually will have to vote
on whether to recommend that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> be impeached.

            
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> are challenging the ethics of this transaction. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Majority Whip</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom DeLay</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>, says it's "quite unseemly for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX>, whose fate is in the hands of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Judiciary Committee</ENAMEX> ... to raise a
lot of money for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> who sits on that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committee</ENAMEX>." <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DeLay</ENAMEX> says that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s "war room is totally engaged in jury tampering" and that "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schumer</ENAMEX>
ought to recuse himself."

            The "jury tampering" metaphor has been circulating ever
since <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Independent Counsel</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth Starr</ENAMEX> submitted his impeachment referral to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>. The metaphor supposes that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">jurors</ENAMEX>
and must be protected accordingly. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Six days</TIMEX> after receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX>'s report,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DeLay</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> sent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis Freeh</ENAMEX> a
letter protesting the dissemination of "prurient allegations" about the
"personal lives" of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GOP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> suggested that "the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> or its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">allies</ENAMEX>" were engaged in "an organized campaign of slander
and intimidation" that was "no different than threatening <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">jurors</ENAMEX> to change
their verdicts in organized crime trials." <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Speaker</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Newt Gingrich</ENAMEX> raised
the "jury tampering" issue in public appearances. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX> similarly
bristled at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s lobbying against the impeachment inquiry. "Don't tamper
with this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jury</ENAMEX>," <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Byrd</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">W.V.</ENAMEX>, admonished the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>.

            The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> camp dismisses the jury metaphor as absurd. "There are probably members
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> campaigning for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Judiciary Committee</ENAMEX>," <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe Lockhart</ENAMEX> observed in response to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DeLay</ENAMEX>'s objection. "I don't think it's a legitimate issue."

            
But why not embrace the metaphor and its
implications instead? Rule <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Rules of Criminal</ENAMEX> Procedure
details various grounds on which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">jurors</ENAMEX> may be deemed "unable or unqualified to
perform their duties." These include "acquaintance or relationship with
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witnesses</ENAMEX>" (in this case, chiefly <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX>) and biases
regarding "credibility of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witnesses</ENAMEX>" (in this case, whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witnesses</ENAMEX>
would automatically be regarded more favorably). The rule cites precedents
under which the "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defendants</ENAMEX>' right to be tried by impartial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jury</ENAMEX> included [the]
right to examination designed to ascertain possible prejudices of prospective
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">jurors</ENAMEX>." Furthermore, the "trial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX>" is authorized to "remove" any juror
during the trial, "whenever facts are presented which convince [the] trial
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> that [the] <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">juror</ENAMEX>'s ability to perform his duty as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">juror</ENAMEX> is impaired."

            If, as
DeLay imagines, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> were to be treated like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">jurors</ENAMEX>, the
presiding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> would never get around to the question of "tampering." He'd
dismiss the whole <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> for cause.
