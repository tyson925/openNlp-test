            In many <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">fields</ENAMEX>, growing old
means cutting back on your professional responsibilities. But for orchestra
conductors, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">figures</ENAMEX> of mythic virility and longevity, advancing age seems only
to entail taking on more obligations. Consider <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kurt Masur</ENAMEX>, the 71-year-old
music <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Philharmonic</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last week</TIMEX>, it was announced that,
beginning in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Masur</ENAMEX> would become the principal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conductor</ENAMEX> of the London
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philharmonic</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guardian</ENAMEX> reported that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">maestro</ENAMEX>
would, naturally, be resigning his <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> position, which pays him <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1.3</NUMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX>. But the paper was forced to print a correction: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Masur</ENAMEX> is not
leaving <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>. He will be conducting in both <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least 2002</TIMEX>,
when his <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> contract expires.

            With just
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> big jobs, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Masur</ENAMEX> is far from the busiest of the big <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX>. The title probably
belongs to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Plácido Domingo</ENAMEX>, the globetrotting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tenor</ENAMEX>. Anticipating the decline
of his prolific singing career--he's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">57</NUMEX>, and most voices don't last past the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 60s</TIMEX>--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Domingo</ENAMEX> has pursued a sideline in opera conducting. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>, he was
appointed artistic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Opera</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Nov. 1</TIMEX> it was announced
that he would also be replacing the retiring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los Angeles Opera</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Domingo</ENAMEX> intends to run both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX> without cutting back on his
performance schedule at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metropolitan Opera</ENAMEX> and elsewhere, his "Three
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tenors</ENAMEX>" concerts with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Luciano Pavarotti</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">José Carreras</ENAMEX>, his recording
calendar, or his bookings as a guest symphony <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conductor</ENAMEX>. Perhaps the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">paella</ENAMEX> will suffer at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Domingo</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX> he owns in midtown
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manhattan</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Domingo</ENAMEX>'s helicopter-to-rehearsal lifestyle is now the
model for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conductors</ENAMEX> whose salaries often match those of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">star athletes</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">CEOs</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norman Lebrecht</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">London Daily Telegraph</ENAMEX> , perhaps the only
music <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critic</ENAMEX> with much of an instinct for sleuthing, has unearthed some of the
closely guarded salaries. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conductor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lorin Maazel</ENAMEX> earned <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$4.5</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">million</ENAMEX>, including <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1 million</NUMEX> as the chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conductor</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pittsburgh Symphony</ENAMEX>
and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">an additional $2.7 million</NUMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bavarian State Radio Orchestra</ENAMEX>. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pianist-conductor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel Barenboim</ENAMEX> earns <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$3 million</NUMEX> or more as music director
in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX>, artistic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> and general music <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deutsche</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Staatsoper Berlin</ENAMEX>, and as a touring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conductor</ENAMEX> with both the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX> and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vienna</ENAMEX> philharmonics. Perhaps most amazing is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Dutoit</ENAMEX>, who serves as
artistic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montreal Symphony Orchestra</ENAMEX>, musical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Orchestra National de France</ENAMEX>, and the artistic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> and principal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conductor</ENAMEX>
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philadelphia Orchestra</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> season in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saratoga</ENAMEX>. In his spare time,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dutoit</ENAMEX> likes to ... guest conduct.

            Such hall
hopping undeniably adds to the wealth and fame of the world's top conductors.
But is it good for music? The era of the ludicrously prodigious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">maestro</ENAMEX> has
coincided with a sense of unease about the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of the symphony, especially in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">orchestras</ENAMEX> are in poor financial shape, faced with
rising costs, declining box office revenues, and a cutback in public subsidies.
At the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Philharmonic</ENAMEX> and elsewhere, labor and administrative conflict
seems perpetual. And among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with long musical memories, there is a
general feeling that while this may be a period of high competence, it is not a
great moment for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">orchestras</ENAMEX> or conductors. A common complaint is that the sound
of the big <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> symphonies--<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philadelphia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cleveland</ENAMEX>,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX>--while still of extremely high quality, is more and more
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homogenized</ENAMEX>. Might these phenomena--the lackluster symphonic scene and the
overbooked <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conductor</ENAMEX>--be related?

            
The great <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">orchestras</ENAMEX> were built by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conductors</ENAMEX> who by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s standards would be hopeless homebodies. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Symphony</ENAMEX> was honed and polished by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> exile <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Serge Koussevitsky</ENAMEX>, who
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">conducted 100</ENAMEX> concerts a year for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25 years</TIMEX> until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1949</TIMEX> and was midwife to the
creation of great works by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stravinsky</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Schoenberg</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Copland</ENAMEX>. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philadelphia Orchestra</ENAMEX> was led by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leopold Stokowski</ENAMEX>, who reigned supreme for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years until 1938</TIMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eugene Ormandy</ENAMEX> succeeded him--and stayed for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Szell</ENAMEX> had a similar role in shaping <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cleveland</ENAMEX> into a great musical <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, as did
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fritz Reiner</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX>. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> might travel to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> for the summer
festival <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX>, but they lived in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> in which they played. They
auditioned <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">musicians</ENAMEX> personally and knew them well. If a guest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conductor</ENAMEX>
visited <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philadelphia</ENAMEX>, you would probably find <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Ormandy</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">backstage</ENAMEX> or in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX>. Today, by contrast, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conductors</ENAMEX> tend to have a much more tenuous
relationship with their home <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>. Rather than live in some backwater, they
jet in and out for rehearsals and conduct <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> performances a year there instead
of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>. For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nine months</TIMEX> at a stretch, they are somewhere else.

            The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">musician</ENAMEX> who first set this pace was the ex-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Nazi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herbert von Karajan</ENAMEX>, who in
the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late 1950s</TIMEX> was simultaneously principal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conductor</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX>
Philharmonic, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vienna</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Opera</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Salzburg festival</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Von Karajan</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ricocheting</ENAMEX> around <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> stoked an epic recording career and helped build an
estate that was worth <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$300 million</NUMEX> when he died in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX>. There is no one so
dominant now, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karajan</ENAMEX> remains the model for the hyperactive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">batons</ENAMEX> of
Maazel, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barenboim</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zubin Mehta</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Riccardo Muti</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Seji Ozawa</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Claudio Abbado</ENAMEX>.
These conductors compete in a kind of orchestral arms race. The advent of jet
travel--and supersonic jet travel--has made it possible for them to work
virtually simultaneously not just in several <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> but on several continents.
The ambition of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conductor</ENAMEX> is abetted by the avarice of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX>, who
receives a commission of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">up to 20 percent</NUMEX> on the fees and salaries he
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">negotiates</ENAMEX>. The most powerful of these is the reclusive <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald Wilford</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia Artists Management International</ENAMEX>, who manages the world's leading
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conductors</ENAMEX> and uses his market power to drive fees ever higher.

            There are a few honorable exceptions to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">orchestra</ENAMEX>-collecting trend. Perhaps the most admirable is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simon Rattle</ENAMEX>, who
took the insignificant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Birmingham Symphony Orchestra</ENAMEX> and, over a period of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, developed it into a distinguished ensemble. Despite many lucrative
offers, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rattle</ENAMEX> has been loath to even spend much time visiting elsewhere.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rattle</ENAMEX> has now stepped down from the podium at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Birmingham</ENAMEX> and is weighing
offers. It is expected that he will again choose to work with one orchestra
rather than several. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Tilson Thomas</ENAMEX>, who in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX> became the music
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">San Francisco Symphony Orchestra</ENAMEX>, draws praise for doing more
than hanging his hat there. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Finland</ENAMEX>-born <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Esa-Pekka Salonen</ENAMEX> gets high marks for
his commitment to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los Angeles Philharmonic</ENAMEX>, as does <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leonard Slatkin</ENAMEX> at
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Symphony</ENAMEX>.

            Why would an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">orchestra</ENAMEX> prefer
an overpaid, absentee <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">landlord</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Muti</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abbado</ENAMEX> to a dedicated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">resident</ENAMEX>,
especially given that the latter is likely to come much cheaper? Partly, it's
the battle for prestige. A provincial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">orchestra</ENAMEX> with an off-brand conductor
seems doubly provincial. But the bigger issue is finance. Orchestra boards
believe that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">star</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Muti</ENAMEX> sells tickets, even to the majority of concerts
he doesn't conduct. And even the occasional presence of a musical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">superstar</ENAMEX>
makes it much easier to raise money. At a recent fund-raiser, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Opera</ENAMEX> took in an extraordinary <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2.6 million</NUMEX>, thanks to the charming presence of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Domingo</ENAMEX>.

            There are many more
orchestras than there used to be and arguably fewer great conductors. The
result has been a bidding war for top <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">talent</ENAMEX> and an opportunity to make money
that few can resist. The recent transformation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conductor</ENAMEX>'s career
parallels what has happened elsewhere in the economy. As the income of top
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">performers</ENAMEX> of all kinds has risen exponentially, the old patterns of indenture
have fallen away. The ability of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zubin Mehta</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$6 million</NUMEX> plus per year) or a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Barkley</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$4.6 million</NUMEX>) to make really big money has led to a system of
free <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">basketball</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> are constituted by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the season</TIMEX>, each
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">player</ENAMEX> looking out for his own career doesn't appear to harm the overall
quality of the game. But in symphonic music, where great achievement comes from
teamwork over a much longer time frame, the moonlighting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">maestro</ENAMEX> is playing too
fast.
