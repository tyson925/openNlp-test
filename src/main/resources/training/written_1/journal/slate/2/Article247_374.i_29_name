            Both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX>
lead <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Middle East</ENAMEX> policy moves. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>
Times leads with the police <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief-designee</ENAMEX>'s first meet-the-press, in
which he said he should be judged by whether or not he cuts crime. And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA Today</ENAMEX>
leads with the resumption of talks in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UPS</ENAMEX> strike.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> stories report that in the wake of last
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jerusalem</ENAMEX> bombing, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> has abandoned his low-profile of
recent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Middle East</ENAMEX> matters and is ready to revive an upgraded pace of
negotiations between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palestine Authority</ENAMEX>. This will immediately
mean a visit to the region by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> special <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">envoy</ENAMEX> and before too long, one
by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madeleine Albright</ENAMEX> as well.

            Another story that gets near-universal front-page treatment is the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>'s news conference <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> about things fiscal. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> emphasize <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s announcement that the budget deficit for this
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year</TIMEX> will be a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23-year</TIMEX> low of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$37 billion</NUMEX>, while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAT</ENAMEX> chooses to
stress his comment that he expects to exercise the line-item veto (a
presidential <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>) on the budget and tax bills he just signed.

            But from the standpoint of sheer front-page copy and photo space, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX>'s
top story is none of these--it's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX>'s surprise announcement that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> is investing <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$150 million</NUMEX> in its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">rival</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>. The stunning news was
delivered by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">co-founder</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Jobs</ENAMEX> at an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX> trade fair in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX>,
while <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Gates</ENAMEX> looked on and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commented approvingly</ENAMEX> via a giant TV screen.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAT</ENAMEX> provides the most concise explanation: "The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> will share
all patent rights. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> guarantees it will develop software for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Macintosh</ENAMEX> computers. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX> will make <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>'s Internet <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Explorer</ENAMEX> the main Web
browser on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mac</ENAMEX>."

            Both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> and LAT make the point that the deal isn't about
the operating system competition between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>, which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> won
long ago, but is about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>'s need to secure its business as the largest
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">seller</ENAMEX> of programs for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macintosh</ENAMEX> computers (the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> observes) and to
bolster its position in Internet products (the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> observe.) All the majors report that
the announcement was met by boos and catcalls from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macheads</ENAMEX>, as
was the deal-sealing appearance by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gates</ENAMEX>.

            In a story that was no doubt press-released to death, somehow only the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> managed to mention that the deal leaves <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> with a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7 percent</NUMEX>
stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>. But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WSJ</ENAMEX> gets the nod for reporting the most
intriguing singularity that otherwise went unnoticed: that as part of the deal,
besides the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$150 million</NUMEX> investment, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> will pay <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX> an additional
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$100 million</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> wouldn't elaborate for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal</ENAMEX> except to say
"any payments would be non-material." (Does that mean spiritual?)

            All the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">majors</ENAMEX> that carry photos (that is, everybody but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WSJ</ENAMEX> )
accompany the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft/Apple</ENAMEX> story with the same top-of-the-page shot: a giant
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">televised Bill Gates</ENAMEX> looming over a tiny, merely <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">human</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Jobs</ENAMEX>. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX>
made this choice, do you think they were at all aware how much this looks like
that famous <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Super Bowl</ENAMEX> ad that first introduced the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macintosh</ENAMEX>? The only thing
missing is the babe running up the aisle flinging a hammer at the screen.
