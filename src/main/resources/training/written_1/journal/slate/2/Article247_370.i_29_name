            Things are a little slow even for a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> when <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">majors</ENAMEX> working
the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekend</TIMEX> lead with local stories--the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>
Times goes with a water dispute between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">L.A.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego</ENAMEX>, and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> with a school budget story. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX>
lead is a fairly mundane account of how the various spending bills are faring
in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>, which does however contain the news that in contrast to the
dilatory rancor of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past few years</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> has already approved <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> of
the thirteen necessary authorizing bills, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX>.

            On the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> 's front there's a story about the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> black,
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> white, who are at the center of the reverse discrimination in hiring case
that will be taken up by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fall</TIMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Piscataway</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Jersey</ENAMEX> school <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX>, faced with having to lay off <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of them,
chose to retain the black because she was the only black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">faculty member</ENAMEX> in her
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX>. Since then, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> reports, due to a staff retirement,
the fired <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> is back at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>, so that now the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> teach in
adjoining <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">classrooms</ENAMEX> and share an office and a telephone. They do not, however,
speak.

            According to a front-page story in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinton</ENAMEX>
administration has made <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> very direct commitment to moving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> from
welfare to work: It seems that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last May</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> mail room hired a
29-year-old welfare <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>.

            Politics has never made stranger bedfellows than in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Will</ENAMEX>'s WP
column in which on libertarian grounds, he defends the right of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">African-American</ENAMEX> hair care <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">practitioners</ENAMEX> to administer unlicensed
"sisterlocks."

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> reports that "after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three days</TIMEX> of intensive investigation,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">federal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> said they have yet to find any link between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Middle East</ENAMEX>
terrorist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">suspects</ENAMEX> arrested <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> in an alleged suicide-bomb
plot to attack <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">subways</ENAMEX>." Furthermore, says the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> , "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A</ENAMEX>
statement <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> that purports to speak for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hamas</ENAMEX> denied that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> had
anything to do with the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Palestinian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">suspects</ENAMEX>...." And perhaps because
policy nuances tend to get lost amidst all the funerals and severed limbs, the
statement added that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hamas</ENAMEX> "does not act hostilely towards the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>."

            According to a piece inside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> is offering a new reason
why the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> wasn't lying about <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">UFOs</ENAMEX> when it said there was nothing to
the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">UFO</ENAMEX> sighting reports made over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</TIMEX>--namely, it was lying
about something else. It turns out the spooks knew that a lot of those
sightings were of the then-totally-secret <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U-2</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SR-71</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">spyplanes</ENAMEX>.

            The WP front features a story about how various ex-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> were crucial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lobbyists</ENAMEX> on the budget bills. Including, it seems,
former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Packwood</ENAMEX>, who successfully lobbied on behalf of lumber mills
and other small businesses for a cut in the estate tax. Do you think <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Packwood</ENAMEX>
was thinking about the tax code when he told the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> , "There's always
moments you miss when you're not on the inside."?
