            Bombing terrorism, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> and in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York City</ENAMEX>, is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX>'s most urgent
news. The older, cooling, stories of the budget bill and the robust economy
round out <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s coverage. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX>
leads with the immediate aftermath of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jerusalem</ENAMEX> market bombing, and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> leads with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> raid in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brooklyn</ENAMEX> that apparently interrupted a plot to blow up <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">subways</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">buses</ENAMEX>, a
plot with eerie reflections of, if not actual connections to, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jerusalem</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">slaughter</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA Today</ENAMEX> leads with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX>'s final congressional
approval of the tax and spending bills, while the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>
Times goes with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 2nd quarter</TIMEX> economic figures.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> reports that "<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> and federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> arrested
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and seized <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> powerful bombs <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> after a tense shootout in a
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">seedy Brooklyn</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> began an intensive investigation to
determine whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">suspects</ENAMEX> had ties to any <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Middle East</ENAMEX> terrorist
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX>." (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Editors</ENAMEX> take note: there is never a calm shootout.) According
to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mayor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rudolph Giuliani</ENAMEX>, one of those arrested expressed support for
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jerusalem</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bombers</ENAMEX>. The episode, the paper observes, marks the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> time in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past four years</TIMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York City</ENAMEX> has experienced a terrorist threat with
a real or apparent <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Middle East</ENAMEX> connection.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAT</ENAMEX> each report
that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> working the case believe that the plot was an intended
suicide bombing. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">plotters</ENAMEX> had second thoughts and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">last night</TIMEX> flagged
down a patrol <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>. He didn't speak any <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> so, reports the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> , his
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> of communicating imminent disaster to the cops was to repeatedly cup and
fling apart his hands while screaming, "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BOMBA</ENAMEX>." The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> says the man
later told an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">interpreter</ENAMEX>, "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">My roommates</ENAMEX> are going to follow up on
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jerusalem</ENAMEX>."

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> depicts the rapidly disintegrating political relations
between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Palestine</ENAMEX>, reporting that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> "threatened to
send <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commandos</ENAMEX> into <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Palestinian</ENAMEX> areas and had decreed a series of severe
punitive measures against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palestinian Authority</ENAMEX>. Also, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX>
says that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Benjamin Netanyahu</ENAMEX> assailed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yassir Arafat</ENAMEX> for encouraging terrorism,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arafat</ENAMEX> accused <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Netanyahu</ENAMEX> of making excuses for the collapse of the peace
process.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> observes that due to changes in the law, the tax reductions
favoring extremely small numbers of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">beneficiaries</ENAMEX> in the tax bill now on the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>'s desk are listed there quite explicitly. So it took no real sleuth
work for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> to point out that the bill bestows special favors on
"hard-cider <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">producers</ENAMEX> in upstate <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vermont</ENAMEX>," "life insurance
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> and securities <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX>," "<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mississippi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sheriffs</ENAMEX>," and "software giants
like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>." <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> notes other special cases: <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producers</ENAMEX> of
"arrows," "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> of marginal oil <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wells</ENAMEX> and skydiving <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planes</ENAMEX>." The tax bill,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal</ENAMEX> notices, "even allows <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> wine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bottlers</ENAMEX> to continue using
names, including <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX> and burgundy, of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> wine-producing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX>."

            The LAT trumpets the just-released <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2nd quarter annualized</TIMEX> growth rate
of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.2 percent</NUMEX> and annualized inflation rate of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.4 percent</NUMEX> (the lowest in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>) as together indicating a "calmer" economy. The "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Washington Wire</ENAMEX>" of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WSJ</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">concurs</TIMEX>, noting that "not one of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">131</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> surveyed by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Association of Business Economists</ENAMEX> says his or her firm plans on a
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX> recession." The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> story is in the middle of stating that
"financial markets cheered the report, which bolstered signs that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reserve</ENAMEX>..." when it interrupts itself with an insert box headlined, "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOW RALLY</ENAMEX>
ENDS."
