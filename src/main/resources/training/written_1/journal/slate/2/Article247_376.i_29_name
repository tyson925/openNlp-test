            <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> policy in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Balkans</ENAMEX> leads both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX>
and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> . The train wreck occurring early yesterday
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arizona</ENAMEX> desert, which left <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scores</ENAMEX> injured, but killed no one, is
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Angeles Times</ENAMEX> lead.

            In light of a major <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arizona</ENAMEX> derailment <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years ago</TIMEX> that proved to be
vandalism, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> reports that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> is investigating, but that all
indicators indicate the cause was instead a patch of flooded track.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bosnia</ENAMEX> story reports that former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assistant secretary</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">state</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard C. Holbrooke</ENAMEX>, briefly back in government service for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a four-day</TIMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mission</ENAMEX> to the region, met with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Slobodan Milosevic</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yugoslavia</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> and told him that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> is prepared to arrest
Bosnian <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Serb</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> and wanted war criminal Radovan Karadzic "unless he takes
himself out of circulation voluntarily." The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> account emphasizes
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> decisiveness--"I was exceedingly blunt about what could happen, and you
can quote me on that," it records <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Holbrooke</ENAMEX> as saying. But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX>
version seems to stress instead <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Serbian</ENAMEX> intransigence, reporting that
"<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Holbrooke</ENAMEX> acknowledged he was 'skeptical' of a pledge made at the meeting that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Karadzic</ENAMEX> would be stopped from wielding power behind the scenes in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Serb</ENAMEX>-held part of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bosnia</ENAMEX>" and saying the negotiations ended "without any major
breakthrough."

            According to a second <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bosnia</ENAMEX> story on the WP front page, the topic
attracts far more administration attention and effort than the public realizes.
Judging by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>'s speeches and his directions to his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>, says the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> , he "seems to have <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bosnia</ENAMEX> on the brain." The feeling is that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dayton</ENAMEX> accord for resolving the conflict there is perhaps the major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinton</ENAMEX>
administration foreign policy achievement, one that is in great danger of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">evaporating</ENAMEX>.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> reports that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> seems to be endorsing economic
and political reform for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time since the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Tiananmen Square</ENAMEX> crackdown.
It says a recent front-page editorial in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Communist People's Daily</ENAMEX>
proclaimed that "the words 'market economy' have been writ large on the flag of
socialism for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time" and denounced party <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> favoring a slowdown
in market reforms.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> runs a front-page story pointing out a little-known
consequence of the increasingly strict <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> deportation policy for illegal
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX> convicted of felonies here. The program, intended to lower <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
crime and decrease prison crowding, is accelerating the growth of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>-style
gang crime throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Salvador</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>. So great is
the disruption in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Salvador</ENAMEX>, says the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> , that death squads have
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">re</ENAMEX>-emerged, this time targeting not political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enemies</ENAMEX>, but deportee <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">gang</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> there even think civil war could break out again, now over
public safety issues.

            Think the rapid growth of area codes is the inexorable result of the
increasing need for more and more data lines? Well, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Week in</ENAMEX>
Review" piece points out that another factor is that under current
arrangements, many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">numbers</ENAMEX> assigned to "saturated" area codes go unused. Fixing
this could considerably extend the length of time between new area codes for a
given location. Incidentally, one of the matters <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Holbrooke</ENAMEX> tended to this
weekend besides crimes against humanity was the allocation of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bosnian</ENAMEX> area
codes.

            You remember, of course, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan Quayle</ENAMEX> was caught trying to get that <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">sixth</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grader</ENAMEX> to spell 'potato' with an 'e' on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end</TIMEX>. Well, an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX> story in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">WP</ENAMEX> reveals that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX> was stronger in spelling than in family values.
He dropped out of school and now just <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five years later</TIMEX>, he's an unmarried
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> of a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14-month-old</TIMEX>.
