            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Angeles Times</ENAMEX> says <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s top story is new revelations about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> fundraising. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York</ENAMEX>
Times says it's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> fraud. And the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> says it's a proposed <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Iranian</ENAMEX> oil
pipeline.

            It has previously been reported that in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 1995</TIMEX>, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Lady</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> grounds, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">entrepreneur</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnny</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chung</ENAMEX>, in order to gain presidential access for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">delegation</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chinese</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">businessmen</ENAMEX>, gave a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$50,000</NUMEX> check to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary Clinton</ENAMEX>'s then-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief of staff</ENAMEX>. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> line is that this event did not violate federal law because the
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$50K</NUMEX> was not solicited, only passively accepted. But <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chung</ENAMEX>--who has
refused to cooperate with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> unless granted immunity from
prosecution--tells the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> that yes it was. He says he wrote the check
after he was told that he could help defray some bills relating to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> party costs that Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> had run up with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democratic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Committee</ENAMEX>. And <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chung</ENAMEX> says that afterwards he was told that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Lady</ENAMEX>
definitely knew about his donation. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chung</ENAMEX> explains the transaction to the
LAT this way: "I see the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> is like a subway--you have to put
in coins to open the gates."

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT Medicare</ENAMEX> story is that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Accounting Office</ENAMEX> has just
released a report uncovering widespread fraud, overcharges, and poor care in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX>-funded services for the homebound <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elderly</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> points out
that whereas <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten years ago</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> reviewed <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60 percent</NUMEX> of claims, last
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> it looked into <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 2 percent</NUMEX> of them.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> oil story is that "the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> has decided
not to oppose a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1.6 billion</NUMEX> pipeline that would carry huge quantities of
Central <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asian</ENAMEX> natural gas across <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX>, the first significant easing of the
economic isolation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tehran</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> and other
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>." The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> recently reported that a host of prominent former
foreign policy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> including <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zbigniew Brzezinski</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brent Scowcroft</ENAMEX> had
lobbied on behalf of various petroleum industry <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">interests</ENAMEX> for just such an
outcome.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> has an interesting front-page profile of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ward Connerly</ENAMEX>, the
millionaire black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">businessman</ENAMEX> who has emerged from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">campus</ENAMEX> politics of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of California</ENAMEX> to become the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s most active <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponent</ENAMEX> of racial
preferences. The story describes a racially mixed and fractured <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, "whose
secrets seem to leap from the pages of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Faulkner</ENAMEX>." Also, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Connerly</ENAMEX> tells the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> about an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SAT</ENAMEX> study that shows that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> earning more
than <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$60,000</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> were outscored by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asian-Americans</ENAMEX> whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>
earned <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$20,000</NUMEX> or less. "You hear that black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> need a preference because
there's no one encouraging them to go to college," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Connerly</ENAMEX> says. "Well, these
upper-income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> who are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professors</ENAMEX>, so you
can't conclude the problem is at home."

            It's hard to believe that an explosion that vented <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plutonium</ENAMEX> into the
atmosphere at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>'s largest nuclear weapons storage <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> doesn't
make anybody's front page, but in fact you have to go inside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> to read about the "near-complete breakdown in emergency response" at
the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hanford Nuclear Reservation</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two months ago</TIMEX> after an accident there,
"exposing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> to a toxic plume and leaving outside <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> unaware of
the danger until <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> after the event."

            One explanation is that so many column-inches and so many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX> are
instead assigned to "hot" stories regardless of their real import. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> has an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1800</TIMEX>-word piece showing that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrew Cunanan</ENAMEX> is still dead.
And that's paltry besides the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> 's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,000</NUMEX>-word front-page effort on the
same subject, to which the paper saw fit to assign <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staffers</ENAMEX>.
