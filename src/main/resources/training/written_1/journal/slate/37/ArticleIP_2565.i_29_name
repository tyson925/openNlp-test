            After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50 years</TIMEX> of writing
about the budget, I have become bored with the subject, and have been looking
for a more emotionally satisfying interest. It may seem bizarre, but I have
found <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> such interest in watching ballet at home on my VCR. I call that
bizarre because I cannot dance a step. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of my most anguished memories is of
trying to propel an unfortunate female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classmate</ENAMEX> around the floor at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mohawk</ENAMEX>
Country <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Club</ENAMEX> during the senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prom</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Schenectady</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">High School</ENAMEX>. I did not
improve much with time, although I did find a more agreeable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX>.

            Despite
that, or perhaps because of that--<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">psychologists</ENAMEX> always have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> options--I have
long been fascinated by dance. In college I participated in an essay contest
that required <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">entrants</ENAMEX> to use a nom de plume. I chose "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bojangles</ENAMEX>," the nickname
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bill Robinson</ENAMEX>, the famous movie and stage tap <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dancer</ENAMEX>. I mention that partly
to show that my interest did not always and only lie in long-legged <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tutus</ENAMEX>.

            Ifirst became aware of ballet at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Chicago</ENAMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of my first dates with the young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> who was to be my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> took us to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Les Sylphides</ENAMEX> downtown in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Loop</ENAMEX>. For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60 years</TIMEX> thereafter, the ballet
remained an occasional diversion. Only recently, when--as I have noted--boredom
with the budget and, indeed, with economic policy in general left a vacuum at
the forefront of my consciousness, did ballet come in to fill it. I am by no
stretch of the imagination an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX>. I am writing only to indicate what
pleasure the ballet, now readily available on videotape, has given this klutz,
and to suggest that others like me might also get pleasure from it.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ballet</ENAMEX> may
have special appeal <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these days</TIMEX>, because it is a relief from the verbal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">communication</ENAMEX> in which we are all drowning. It is like music in that respect.
Music may have a more transcendental, spiritual quality. But ballet has more
--of scene, of form, and of movement; for many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, ballet offers more by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> for the mind than music does.

            
I am going to focus first on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Swan Lake</ENAMEX> .
It is the most popular ballet of all time and probably the easiest to
appreciate. Also, I happen to have on tape <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> versions of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Swan Lake</ENAMEX> ,
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> featuring <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Margot Fonteyn</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rudolf Nureyev</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1966</TIMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> with the Kirov
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ballet</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</TIMEX>).

            Both
versions are characterized by a complete fusion of the music and the dance. The
music is simple, clear, tuneful, and rhythmic. It seems to compel the dance, as
if the particular steps danced to each note and bar were inevitable and any
other steps would be wrong. Listening, one gets--or, at least, I get--the
(improbable) feeling that the music is so compelling that if I were on stage
and heard it, I, too, would do that dance. Yet, as natural and inevitable as it
seems, the dance is also absolutely incredible. It is unbelievable that anyone
could do what those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dancers</ENAMEX> are doing. That applies not only to the obviously
spectacular leaps and spins, but also to the precise placement of the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">feet</NUMEX> when
walking slowly, and of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> when seated.

            Everyone knows the story of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Swan Lake</ENAMEX> . It was summed
up in the comment of a little old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX> (why is it always a little old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX> and
never a big young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>?) who, after seeing it, said: "So, he fell in love with a
duck. So what could come of it?" To amplify just a little: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Odette</ENAMEX> is a
beautiful maiden trapped in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> of a swan. She can be freed only by
someone who will love her forever. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prince Siegfried</ENAMEX> promises her that love, but
he is seduced into betraying that promise by the beautiful, but not so nice,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Odile</ENAMEX>. Dire consequences loom.

            The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> versions I have
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differed</ENAMEX> in the degree to which they emphasized the story. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kirov</ENAMEX> version
(at least the one I saw) was a vaudeville in which discrete, and stunning,
dance performances are hung on the thread of the story. It was staged before a
live <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> that repeatedly broke into applause to which the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stars</ENAMEX> responded
with bows. That, of course, interrupted the story. It also took the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stars</ENAMEX> out
of their characters--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Siegfried</ENAMEX> out of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soul</ENAMEX>-sickness, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Odette</ENAMEX> out of her
heartbreak, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Odile</ENAMEX> out of her seductiveness. Moreover the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principals</ENAMEX>, while
their dancing was brilliant, hadn't really tried to be soul-sickened,
heartbroken, or seductive. The problem was particularly serious for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Siegfried</ENAMEX>,
who in the first act seemed a happy-go-lucky <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fellow</ENAMEX>, with no apparent reason to
spurn the beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> and go out hunting a mirage.

            The
Fonteyn-Nureyev version, on the other hand, emphasized the story, with all its
. The show slimmed the story down considerably, with some of the most
spectacular parts being cut. There was no <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX>, no applause, no
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interruptions</ENAMEX>, no bows in the middle of the story. Nureyev, who was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX> at the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>, looked the anguished, searching youth that the story requires. Fonteyn
portrayed clearly in her facial expressions and arm movements the contrasting
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Odette</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Odile</ENAMEX>.

            
Both versions are wonderful. In a sense, you
get more ballet for your money in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kirov</ENAMEX> version. But you get more emotion
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fonteyn-Nureyev</ENAMEX> version.

            My recent
interest in ballet has opened my eyes to a newer style that I used to find
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">unattractive</ENAMEX> and incomprehensible. It is less athletic and acrobatic than the
older, more romantic ballets. What there is in the way of stylized leaps,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">spins</ENAMEX>, and balancing on the toes comes out as the natural expression of
exceptionally graceful human beings and not as a demonstration of what some
clever windup toys can do.

            The main reaction to the older ballets is, "Wow! How can
anyone do that?" The newer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ballets</ENAMEX> do not elicit that response. At first sight
they look easy, although further observation shows how precise and disciplined
the movements are. The newer ballets aim for more universal and fundamental
emotions than amazement--for a sense of beauty, or joy, or love, or sorrow.

            How those emotions are
generated I cannot explain. But I can give <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> illustrations, both from ballets
by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Balanchine</ENAMEX> that I have on tape. The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Prodigal Son</ENAMEX> is an old
story. But the performance, by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mikhail Baryshnikov</ENAMEX> and others, is so vigorous
and stark that it seems new. And at the end, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baryshnikov</ENAMEX> throws himself
into the arms of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>, who wraps him in his prayer shawl, one gets a
powerful sense of the goodness of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> and God. The other example is
Chaconne , starring <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Suzanne Farrell</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Martins</ENAMEX>. If there is a
story there, I don't get it. However, the dancing seems so free and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">spontaneous</ENAMEX>, and yet so precise and with such commitment between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partners</ENAMEX>,
that one is left with a feeling of joy in life that I cannot associate with any
other form of art.

            I realize I am gushing. That
is the way new and naive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enthusiasts</ENAMEX> are. I also realize that ballet may not be
everyone's cup of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX>. But if you are sick of watching <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gingrich</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">waltz</ENAMEX> around, you might try <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fonteyn</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nureyev</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Farrell</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Martins</ENAMEX>.
