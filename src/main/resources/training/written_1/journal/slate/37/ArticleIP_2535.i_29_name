            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Teen-agers</ENAMEX> are notorious
for taking things very personally, for blowing them way out of proportion. But
they could be forgiven for feeling that they were given an unusually tough time
of it during this presidential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">race</ENAMEX>. Curfews, V-chips, harsher penalties for
juvenile crime, school uniforms, drug tests to get a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">driver</ENAMEX>'s license: Both
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> were, like, really on their case.

            The
get-tough-on-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teens</ENAMEX> strategy was only picking up on the mood of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the hour</TIMEX>. When
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mall of America</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bloomington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minn.</ENAMEX>, the largest "retail and
entertainment complex" in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, announced a curfew and chaperone policy
for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adolescents</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teen-agers</ENAMEX> seemed well on their way to becoming
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">national</ENAMEX> pariahs. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Every Friday</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">from 6 p.m.</TIMEX> on, no teen-ager
under <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> may enter the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mall</ENAMEX> unless accompanied by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> or adult over
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>--this at a place where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> aren't watching TV, aren't driving recklessly,
aren't having sex or committing prosecutable crimes. (Sure, they sometimes
fight, but "let's be clear," a police <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> said, "we're talking about
noncriminal conduct by a bunch of snotty-nosed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>.") What they are doing is
hanging out and engaging in that national pastime, spending money on junk.

            
It is a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">20 th</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> habit
to portray <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adolescents</ENAMEX> as incipient juvenile <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">delinquents</ENAMEX>, when not idealizing
them as "the future of our society." But it doesn't take a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pollster</ENAMEX> to see why
alarm has suddenly intensified, as it did in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 1950s</TIMEX> when another bulge
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> began to hit puberty. (Publicity about urban <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gang</ENAMEX> violence aroused a
sense of panic then.) <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Baby</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boomers</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> whose self-conscious identity
was forged in the crucible of adolescence, now have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adolescents</ENAMEX> of their own.
That's not an easy stage to live through, even in the most orderly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">era</ENAMEX>. You have to show a big <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX>--one who may be bigger than you--who is still
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">boss</ENAMEX>. And <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby-boomer parents</ENAMEX> are bound to find this phase especially daunting.
After all, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adolescents</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25 or 35 years ago</TIMEX>, they gave the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boss</ENAMEX> a very hard
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> and had a pretty wild time themselves.

            Shouldn't <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> just
relax, on the grounds that they lived to tell (or not tell) the tale? They
faced far fewer restraints in their teen-age <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teens</ENAMEX> do now. You could
get a nicotine fix by just opening the door of any decent student <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lounge</ENAMEX> in
high <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Between 1970 and 1975</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> lowered the legal age for buying
alcoholic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beverages</ENAMEX>. Dress codes were dumped. Drug panic and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> fears didn't
crimp youthful fun--and peer pressure couldn't have been stronger to go ahead
and do more than experiment.

            But
panic over <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youth</ENAMEX> is a natural reflex of middle age, when the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oat</ENAMEX>-sowing past
comes back to haunt <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>. As a newly affluent "youth market," it was baby
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boomers</ENAMEX> who helped usher in a commercialized popular culture that has become
more powerful and awful than they could have imagined. You don't have to be Bob
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dole or Dan Quayle</ENAMEX> to believe that virtues such as self-restraint and
discipline are getting harder to sell, and ever more socially desirable.
Adolescent drift and empty <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hedonism</ENAMEX> can't be brushed off merely as a phase,
readily outgrown. For some vulnerable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teen-agers</ENAMEX>, these traits can't be
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">outgrown</ENAMEX>. Think of all the inner-city <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> who have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">babies</ENAMEX>, and all the
inner-city <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> who are dead.

            
What is frustrating about the current crusade
to rein in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teen-agers</ENAMEX>, though, is that it seems so, well, adolescent. The
high-decibel concern about wayward <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youth</ENAMEX> is full of defensive bluster and
muddle-headed ambivalence, and it is strikingly lacking in realism.

            A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> of well-timed new
books about <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teen-agers</ENAMEX> usefully criticize the distortions of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s anti-teen
rhetoric, though they also succumb to distortions of their own. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike Males</ENAMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Scapegoat Generation</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">America's War on Adolescents</ENAMEX> , tends
to be overzealous when he argues that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> attack <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> as a way of coping
with their own problems, but he has a point. In a recent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX>
op-ed piece surveying the grim <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> and crime statistics for youth, he made a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">persuasive</ENAMEX> case that could be summed up as, "So's your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>." Yes, the
violent crime arrest rate among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adolescents</ENAMEX> has increased by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">65 percent</NUMEX> since
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1980</TIMEX>, but it has risen by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">66 percent</NUMEX> among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 30 and 50</TIMEX>. Yes,
reports suggest that teen-age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">marijuana</ENAMEX> use has risen <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> percentage points
since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX>, but the big news of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Household Survey on Drug</ENAMEX>
Abuse is that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> have the most severe drug problems.

            Anecdotal support of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Males</ENAMEX>'
view is easy to find in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sydney Lewis</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A Totally Alien Life-Form:</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Teenagers</ENAMEX> , an oral history of contemporary <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> adolescence. Almost all
of the messed-up <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> she interviews have messed-up <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jason Hudgins</ENAMEX>, a
chronic runaway who has done every drug imaginable, been molested, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assaulted</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, grew up with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> alcoholic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> who
violently beat him and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> who was herself battered and raped. Even the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> who report to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewis</ENAMEX> that they're doing OK speak of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> who've been in
real, often long-term trouble: with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX>, abusive relationships,
crimes. In the life stories the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teen-agers</ENAMEX> so eagerly share, it's hardly rare
for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fathers</ENAMEX>--or even <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX>--to run away.

            Both
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewis</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Males</ENAMEX> go overboard, he by playing loose with statistics that demonize
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>, she by romanticizing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teen-agers</ENAMEX>. Males invokes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Justice</ENAMEX>
findings that show "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> and caretakers inflicted a half-million serious
injuries on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youths</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>, quadruple the number reported in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</TIMEX>." Surely that reflects altered reporting standards, not a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven-year</TIMEX> surge
in sadistic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> (just as the implausible <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX> discovery that
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">teen-age drug</ENAMEX> use doubled in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one year</TIMEX> reflected a radical rewriting of the
survey <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that year</TIMEX>, as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> pointed out). And where
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Males reduces teen-agers</ENAMEX> to mere <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewis</ENAMEX> is inclined to make
them all struggling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">victors</ENAMEX> in spite of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>. Her interviews routinely end
with hope running high. Even <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jason Hudgins</ENAMEX> gets to soar. "I look in the mirror
and I think to myself: 'Look at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> that you're coming to be.' "

            
It's a little hard to believe that the Jasons
of the world end up "straightening out," as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewis</ENAMEX> titles the section about the
worst-off cases, just as it's hard to buy the extreme view that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> are
hopeless screw-ups. What the current fixation on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teen-agers</ENAMEX> really shows is
that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> are just as confused and ambivalent about their rights and their
responsibilities as their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> tend to be.

            They want laws that require
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teens</ENAMEX> that they behave like obedient <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>. They want laws that punish
them as full-fledged <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>. They want laws that demand of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> that they
act like authority figures. They want laws that punish them as delinquent
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">babysitters</ENAMEX>. On the one hand, many of the curfews cracking down on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teens</ENAMEX> also
entail a fine on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> of youthful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">curfew</ENAMEX>-breakers. A spate of explicit
"parental responsibility" laws passed by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> over the last
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">couple of years</TIMEX> give <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judges</ENAMEX> the power to make <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> pay for juvenile
detention or undergo counseling with their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Parents</ENAMEX> can even be threatened
with imprisonment themselves if their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teen-agers</ENAMEX> run amok.

            On the other hand, some
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> have passed new laws that treat juvenile <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">criminals</ENAMEX> as responsible
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>. Of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX>, a conservative lobbying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, has launched a nationwide
campaign to add a "parental rights amendment" to state constitutions declaring
it "the inalienable right" of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> to "direct and control the upbringing,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">education</ENAMEX>, values and discipline of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>." An initiative to introduce
it is on the ballot in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colorado</ENAMEX>. The obvious targets of the sweepingly vague
amendment are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinics</ENAMEX> offering confidential medical services, and schools
providing sex-ed classes and suspicious curricula and books. But presumably the
amendment could also be used against <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judges</ENAMEX> who come down hard on lax
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>.

            The
contradictions are blithely overlooked, as is any spirit of practicality. Who
actually thinks that having <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teen-agers</ENAMEX> line up to pee after they've
demonstrated their parallel parking skills is a reasonable way "to demand
responsible behavior by young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> when it comes to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>," as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinton</ENAMEX>
proclaimed? <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sixteen-year-olds</TIMEX> can drive perfectly on the momentous day they
present themselves at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Motor Vehicles Bureau</ENAMEX>, and then speed recklessly the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day after</TIMEX>. They're also savvy enough to show up for the road test clean (or
with a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$19.95</NUMEX> package of drug-free urine in their pockets). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s
vote-getting gimmick is cynical posturing--not what the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> call good
role-modeling behavior.

            
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Erik Erikson</ENAMEX> once observed that "we who know so
much about the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> in the adult know so much less about the fate of the
adolescent in him, whether as a continued source of renewal or as a split-off
younger self alternately idealized and repudiated, revived and 'murdered'--and,
of course, reprojected on the young." Caught up in the backlash against <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teens</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> might look in the mirror and think to themselves, "Look at the person
that you're coming to be." The sight of the inner <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teen-ager</ENAMEX> acting out ought to
be fairly sobering. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dick Morris</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who came up with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s get-tough
agenda--now there's a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormone</ENAMEX>-driven delinquent for you!) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Parents</ENAMEX> need to deal
with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teen-agers</ENAMEX>' troubles personally--which means, paradoxically, taking them
less personally; this isn't about the collective guilt of grown-ups, but
about the prospects of individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Politicians</ENAMEX> should also take
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teen-agers</ENAMEX>' troubles seriously. Above all, that means improving education, and
providing lots of extracurricular activities for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adolescents</ENAMEX> in direst
shape. It doesn't mean blowing the problems out of all proportion.
