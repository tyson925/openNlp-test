            How many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> does <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate</ENAMEX>
have? Like other Web sites, we get asked this question all the time. Our usual
reply is: "Thank you for asking. That's a complicated question." But here is
our best effort to answer it, along with an explanation of why counting readers
on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Web</ENAMEX> is so complicated (and why you should take any claims about Web-site
traffic--except ours, of course--with a grain of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX>).

            
Traditional print <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazines</ENAMEX> know exactly how many copies they sell, though they
have no idea how many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> actually read a particular article or see a
particular ad. TV <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> rely on sampling by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nielsen</ENAMEX> to estimate how many
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewers</ENAMEX> were watching which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">any hour of the day</TIMEX>. (See <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate</ENAMEX>'s recent
"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dispatch</ENAMEX>" from someone selected to be a "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nielsen</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>.") <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nielsen</ENAMEX>
and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX> such as PC
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Meter</ENAMEX>, now known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Media Metrix</ENAMEX>, are scrambling to adapt this concept to
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Web</ENAMEX>. Meanwhile, though, there are hits .

            The contents of a Web site are stored on high-performance
computers called servers . When you type a Web address into your browser,
or click on a link or a "favorites" or "bookmark" button, you are telling your
computer to fetch a specific set of data--text, images, sound, etc.--from some
Web site's server. Your browser then assembles these data and displays them as
a page. Each of these requests for information is a hit.

            Hits (per
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">day</ENAMEX>, per week, per month ...) are the most common measure of Web traffic. But
they are deceptive. A single Web page can be one hit or many, depending on how
it is constructed. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more</NUMEX> separate elements it contains (images, sound ...),
the more hits it will require. That's why <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate</ENAMEX>, and some other sites, prefer
to talk about pages served . This is a measure of how many complete pages
your server has sent out in response to requests from browsers. In recent
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate</ENAMEX> has been serving an average of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 90,000</NUMEX> pages <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a day</TIMEX>.

            
But the number of pages served is also a
misleading measure in some ways. A "page" is not a standard <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> on the Web the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> it is in print. Depending on a Web site's design, the same amount of
content can take up a very different number of pages. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate</ENAMEX> is designed so that
every article or feature takes up a single page. Other sites break up articles
into many pages. (We're not suggesting that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are padding their page
counts. It's a judgment call about whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> will find having to scroll
more annoying than having to click and wait.)

            Also,
sometimes a site will feed you two pages when you've only asked for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>. Slate
does this, for example, with our cover and contents pages. However--<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boy</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Girl Scouts</ENAMEX> that we are--we subtract this double counting in the figures we
report. We cannot guarantee that every site is so scrupulous.

            Further complicating page counts is the issue of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">caching</ENAMEX> . Computers at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporations</ENAMEX> and other large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> often
access the Web through a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">middleman</ENAMEX> computer known as a proxy server .
Your computer requests a page from the proxy server, which then requests it
from the Web site. But proxy servers are often programmed to save, or cache,
frequently requested pages, rather than retrieving them from the Web each time
they are requested. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">America Online</ENAMEX> also caches pages for its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX>. And
your own computer is probably set up to cache some pages you've visited
recently. (That's why, when reading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate</ENAMEX>, it's quicker to go back to the
contents page than it was to call it up at the start.) All this caching means
pages are served more quickly, but it does become harder for a Web site to know
how often its pages have actually appeared on someone's screen.

            Anyway,
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> pages served could be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> reading this column, or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> obsessive
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participant</ENAMEX> in "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Fray</ENAMEX>." What we really want to know is how many
individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers Slate</ENAMEX> has. And we can find out, sort of. Each request
to Slate from your browser carries with it an assortment of useful information.
Your computer tells us what operating system and browser software you are
using, so that our server can return a page appropriate to your setup. We also
are told about the referring page --that is, the page you were reading
when you requested this one. (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Marketers</ENAMEX> love that information.) More important,
each page request is accompanied by a return address. How else would the server
know where to send the data? Every computer connected to the Internet has an
address, known as an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IP</ENAMEX> address , consisting of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> numbers. For
example, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">207.68.136.88</NUMEX> is currently the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IP</ENAMEX> address of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate</ENAMEX>'s servers.
Depending on how you access the Internet, your computer has either a permanent
or a temporary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IP</ENAMEX> address.

            
But for a variety of reasons, including
caching, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IP</ENAMEX> addresses aren't a great way of counting individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>.
Therefore, there are <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cookies</ENAMEX> . <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Cookies</ENAMEX> are like the club <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bouncer</ENAMEX> who
stamps your hand when you leave the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">premises</ENAMEX> temporarily, so as to identify you
when you return. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time you visit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate</ENAMEX>, our computer sends yours a
piece of data, which your computer sends back every time you return, so we know
it's you. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Cookies</ENAMEX> aren't perfect. They don't account for multiple people
accessing the site from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> computer, or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> using different computers
(or browser software). Also, some older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">browsers</ENAMEX> don't understand <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cookies</ENAMEX>, and
newer ones allow privacy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">freaks</ENAMEX> to turn them off. But, using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cookies</ENAMEX>, we can
get a pretty good idea of how many unique <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">browsers</ENAMEX> are visiting our
site.

            Even that, though, is a
problematic concept. Do you measure browsers per day? Per week? Per month? The
longer the time period you choose, the more individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> you can claim,
which is nice. On the other hand, because of repeat <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>, the number of
unique browsers in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a given month</TIMEX> is less than the total of unique browsers per
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week</TIMEX> for those <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four weeks</TIMEX>, which is less than the total of unique browsers per
day over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">those 30 days</TIMEX>. Choose your poison: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate</ENAMEX> attracts <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 6,000</NUMEX> unique
browsers a day and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80,000</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a month</TIMEX>.

            More
complications. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Every Friday</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> get a print-out version of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate</ENAMEX>
delivered to them by e-mail. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Click</ENAMEX> here to sign up.) <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Several hundred</NUMEX> others download the print-out version directly from our site <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX>. A
few <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundred</NUMEX> determined <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traditionalists</ENAMEX> pay <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$70</NUMEX> to get this version of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate</ENAMEX>
printed out and mailed to them <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each week</TIMEX> via the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Postal</ENAMEX>
Service. Hotmail, a
Web-based e-mail service, delivers <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate</ENAMEX>'s table of contents to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">106,000</NUMEX> of its
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every week</TIMEX>.

            As this discussion shows, measuring Web traffic is
generally less exact than measuring traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> circulation. In one
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX>, though, it is more exact. We know that every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Slate page</ENAMEX> served--and, by
the way, the ad on that page--has hit the eyeballs of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> (and in all
probability not <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX>). Print <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publications</ENAMEX> have no clear idea of how
many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> read each copy of their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publication</ENAMEX> and, conversely, how many
individual pages of any given copy go unread. In practice, they tend to make
wild claims about the former and ignore the latter.

            Even this distinction,
though, is changing with the development of off-line <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX>: software that
automatically goes to the Web to retrieve material, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> it on your own
computer. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate</ENAMEX> is already part of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PointCast</ENAMEX>, which puts information you select on your screensaver.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Off-line</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> put Web sites--and Web <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">advertisers</ENAMEX>--in the same position as
their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterparts</ENAMEX> in the print world (although the off-line <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> built into
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>'s upcoming Internet <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Explorer 4.0</ENAMEX> will actually send the server a log of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX>'s reading habits).

            So how many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> does
Slate have? Taking all these complications into effect, and being as honest as
we can, we estimate <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about 28 million</NUMEX>, give or take <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27,900,000 or so</NUMEX>.
Remarkable, isn't it?
