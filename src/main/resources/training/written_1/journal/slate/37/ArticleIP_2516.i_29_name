            First, to prevent any
misunderstanding, the warning: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alcohol</ENAMEX>, when abused, is vicious, dangerous
stuff. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Each year</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 100,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> die alcohol-related deaths. No one
should <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drink</ENAMEX> and drive or drink to excess. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>--<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teen-agers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> on
contraindicated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX>, pregnant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, and those who have trouble
controlling their consumption--should avoid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX>, period. And all that you
know already.

            Here is
what you may not know--or may know only fuzzily. For most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of middle age
and beyond, one drink a day helps prevent <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart disease</ENAMEX> and makes you less
likely to die prematurely. After one or (for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>) <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drinks</ENAMEX>, bad effects swamp
the good--dosage is everything! But on average the positive cardiovascular
effect of moderate drinking is not small, and it is not in dispute.
Epidemiologists figure that if all <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> became teetotalers <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX>, about
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80,000</NUMEX> more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> might die <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each year</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart disease</ENAMEX>. So there are lives on
both sides of the equation.

            
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of those lives might, just as an example,
belong to my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>. He is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">69</NUMEX>, has mild <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hypertension</ENAMEX> (controlled with
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">medication) and</ENAMEX>, but for the rare social occasion, doesn't drink. He has read
some news reports suggesting moderate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> use may yield benefits, but his
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> has never mentioned such benefits, and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> has never given a
thought to changing his drinking habits. And, in the standard view of public
health officialdom, that is as it should be: <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> should not be encouraged to
drink, even in moderation, and alcohol should not be linked with better
health.

            The trouble is that moderate
drinking is linked with better health. We don't know exactly why; some
evidence suggests <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX>--of whatever sort, by the way, not just red
wine--stimulates "good" (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HDL</ENAMEX>, for high density lipoprotein) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> and may
help prevent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood clotting</ENAMEX>. But we do know the effects: On average, if you're
over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about 40</TIMEX>, a drink a day will reduce your chances of heart trouble.

            "Besides
the association between smoking and lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>, I think this is the most
consistent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> I've seen in the literature," says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eric Rimm</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">epidemiologist</ENAMEX>. Research has shown heart benefits consistently since the 1970s
with, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rimm</ENAMEX> guesses, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70 or 80</NUMEX> studies of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30 to 35</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> by now. Not
surprisingly, he has a drink on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">most days</TIMEX>.

            
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Alcohol</ENAMEX> also causes harm, of course. It can
increase chances of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX>, cirrhosis, accidents, and so on. Heart
<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, however, is an enormous cause of death; improve those odds, and the
net effect is significantly to the good. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last December</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New England</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal of Medicine</ENAMEX> reported the results of the biggest and probably best
mortality study yet conducted, one that followed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost half a million</NUMEX> people
over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nine years</TIMEX>. It found that, after netting out all causes of death, moderate
drinkers over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> were <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 percent</NUMEX> less likely than nondrinkers to die
prematurely.

            But
there are a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> like my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> out there: uninformed or vaguely
informed or not thinking about it. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>, a free market advocacy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> called
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Competitive Enterprise Institute</ENAMEX> commissioned a survey asking people
whether they believed "that scientific evidence exists showing that moderate
consumption of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately one or two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drinks</ENAMEX> per day, may reduce the
risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart disease</ENAMEX> for many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>." <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Only 42 percent</NUMEX> of those who responded
said they did, and a majority of those believed, wrongly, that the potential
benefits come only from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX>.

            
The evidence on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> and health is now more
than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20 years old</TIMEX>--so why the confusion? <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> groups have a stake in getting the
word out, but one of them, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> industry, is effectively forbidden to do
so. Every bottle of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> carries a
government warning label, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bureau</ENAMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms</ENAMEX> has never permitted ads or labels to carry any
health claims, even mild ones. (For more on rejected health claims, click here.)

            Given that the government
restricts health claims even for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">innocuous foods</ENAMEX> such as orange juice and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX>,
it's reasonable to decide that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">booze</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">merchants</ENAMEX> are the wrong <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to entrust
with public education about drinking. That leaves <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> other constituency
for getting the word out: the public health <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX>. Its approach, however,
might charitably be called cautious--or, less charitably, embarrassed
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mumbling</ENAMEX>.

            For
example, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> of the aforementioned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New England Journal</ENAMEX> study
characterized their finding of a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 percent</NUMEX> mortality reduction as "slight."
The accompanying editorial called it "small." I phoned <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael J. Thun</ENAMEX>, one of
the study's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> and an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">epidemiologist</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Cancer Society</ENAMEX>, and
asked him whether a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 percent</NUMEX> mortality reduction is indeed small in the world
of epidemiology. "It's a sizable benefit in terms of prolonged survival," he
said. Why not say so? "Messages about <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> don't come out the way you say
them when they're broadcast," he replied. "There's been a very long history in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">society</ENAMEX> of problems with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX>."

            
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> health <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX>, in their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>
guidelines (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">"Sensible Drinking"</ENAMEX>), say that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who drink very little or not
at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">all</TIMEX> and are in an age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> at high risk for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart disease</ENAMEX> should "consider
the possibility that light drinking might benefit their health." But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
authorities balk even at such a modest suggestion.

            And so
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> nutritional guidelines say just this about potential
benefits: "Current evidence suggests that moderate drinking is associated with
a lower risk for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">coronary heart disease</ENAMEX> in some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>." They then go on
to recite a litany of risks (for the text, click here). Similarly,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Heart Association</ENAMEX>'s official recommendation advises, "If you
drink, do so in moderation." It goes on to say <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart disease</ENAMEX> is lower in
moderate drinkers but then warns of other dangers and cautions against
"guidelines to the general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX>" that encourage drinking (for the full text,
click here). See for yourself, but I think the message most people
would get from both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> is "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Drinking</ENAMEX> isn't all bad, but eschew it
anyway."

            
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Iasked Ronald Krauss</ENAMEX>--a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> who, as the
immediate past <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Heart Association</ENAMEX>'s nutrition
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">committee</ENAMEX>, helped write that statement--whether it was aggressive enough. "We
don't have much leeway around that 'one or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drinks</ENAMEX> a day,' " he said, and
what isn't known is whether encouraging moderate drinking will also encourage
excessive drinking.

            The
public health <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> understandably dread creating more drunks, more broken
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">marriages</ENAMEX>, more crime, more <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> wrecks. "When somebody calls you up saying,
'You're putting out a message to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to drink, and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> just got
killed <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">last night</TIMEX> because of some drunk,' that's the other side of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">equation</ENAMEX>," <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Thun</ENAMEX> says. "There are substantial numbers of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> out there who
are looking for justification to drink more than they should."

            
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Areal</ENAMEX> worry. But there are lives, again, on
both sides of the equation. The question, then, is what would happen if the
public health <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX> ran a campaign saying, for example, "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Just One Drink"</ENAMEX> or
"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Drink a Little--Not a Lot</ENAMEX>." Would <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>'s drinking habits improve, or would
we create a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> of drunks--or what? The answer is: Nobody knows. What is
surprising, given the public health <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX>'s usual eagerness to save lives,
is that no one is trying to find out. It is simply assumed that too many people
will do the wrong thing.

            "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">People</ENAMEX>
have a very hard time with complicated messages," says <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Thun</ENAMEX>. No doubt some
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> do. But is it really so hard to understand that a glass a day may help
save your life if you're of middle age or beyond, but that more than that is
dangerous? Presumably an avoidable <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart attack</ENAMEX> is equally tragic whether the
cause is too much <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> or too little. To continue <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s policy of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">muttering</ENAMEX> and changing the subject verges perilously on saying not just that
too much <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> is bad for you but that ignorance is good for you.

According to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Surgeon General</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> should not drink alcoholic beverages
during pregnancy because of the risk of birth defects. (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) Consumption of

            The law forbids "curative
and therapeutic claims" in alcohol marketing "if such statement is untrue in
any particular or tends to create a misleading impression." In practice, the
BATF interprets this to mean that any health claim must be fully balanced and
says it "considers it extremely unlikely that such a balanced claim would fit
on a normal alcoholic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beverage</ENAMEX> label." The only health statement the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bureau</ENAMEX> has
said it will accept is a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> page government report, complete with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">footnotes</ENAMEX>. (You can read that report by clicking here.)

            According to documents
obtained by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Competitive Enterprise Institute</ENAMEX> in its lawsuit to have the
current policy overturned, the statements that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bureau</ENAMEX> has barred include
the following: "Several medical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> say that a glass or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of wine
enjoyed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> is not only a pleasant experience but can be beneficial to an
adult's health." "Having reviewed modern research on the benefits of modest
wine consumption, we believe that our <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX>, when enjoyed with wholesome <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX>,
will promote health and enhance the pleasure of life."

            
Currently the wine industry is pushing--so far without success--for approval of
wine labels that read "To learn the health effects of moderate wine
consumption, send for the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dietary Guidelines for</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>"--followed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agriculture Department</ENAMEX>'s address and Web

            Current evidence
suggests that moderate drinking is associated with a lower risk for coronary
<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart disease</ENAMEX> in some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>. However, higher levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> intake
raise the risk for high blood pressure, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart disease</ENAMEX>, certain <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">accidents</ENAMEX>, violence, suicides, birth defects, and overall mortality (deaths).
Too much <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> may cause cirrhosis of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX>, inflammation of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pancreas</ENAMEX>, and damage to the brain and heart. Heavy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drinkers</ENAMEX> also are at risk of
<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malnutrition</ENAMEX> because <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> contains calories that may substitute for those in
more nutritious <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX>.

            If you drink alcoholic
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">beverages</ENAMEX>, do so in moderation, with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meals</ENAMEX>, and when consumption does not put
you or others at risk.

            Moderation
is defined as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">no more than one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drink</ENAMEX> per day for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">no more than two</NUMEX>

            Here is
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Heart Association</ENAMEX>'s recommendation on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX>:

            If you drink, do so in
moderation. The incidence of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart disease</ENAMEX> in those who consume moderate
amounts of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> (an average of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drinks</ENAMEX> per day for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and one
drink per day for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>) is lower than in nondrinkers. However, with increased
intake of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX>, there are increased public health dangers, such as
<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">alcoholism</ENAMEX>, high blood pressure, obesity, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX>, suicide, and accidents. In
light of these and other risks, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AHA</ENAMEX> believes it is not advisable to issue
guidelines to the general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> that may lead some to increase their intake of
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> or start drinking if they do not already do so. It is best to consult
with your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> for advice on consuming <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> in moderation (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">no more than 2</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drinks</ENAMEX> per day).
