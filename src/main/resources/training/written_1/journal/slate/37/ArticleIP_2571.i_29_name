            After I started living
alone, many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> recommended that I get a microwave oven. That, I was told,
would make it easy for me to prepare a meal for myself, and save me a lot of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>. So, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier this year</TIMEX>, during the post-<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> sales, I bought <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>.
Ever since I have been wondering how to figure out what it does for me--how to
do a cost-benefit analysis.

            The
timesaving business is very tricky. For example, a frozen <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chicken potpie</ENAMEX> would
require <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">60 minutes</TIMEX> to thaw and heat in a conventional oven but can be fixed up
in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12 minutes</TIMEX> in the microwave. There's a saving of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">48 minutes</TIMEX>. But the saving
is for my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen</ENAMEX> appliances, not for me. If I use the conventional oven, I am
not going to spend <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">60 minutes</TIMEX> of my time over it--standing next to the oven and
waiting for it to finish its job. I might spend <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a few minutes</TIMEX>--say
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>--putting the potpie in the oven. Then, while waiting for the cooking to
finish, I have <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">55 minutes</TIMEX> for myself--to read the paper, write the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Great</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Novel</ENAMEX>, or do whatever it is I do with my time.

            Paradoxically, the timesaving is more real the smaller the
amount of time to be saved. For example, it takes <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12 minutes</TIMEX> to heat a frozen
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pizza</ENAMEX> in the conventional oven and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">only four minutes</TIMEX> to do it in the microwave.
The <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">eight extra minutes</TIMEX> that I spend waiting for the conventional oven to
finish are too few for me to use outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen</ENAMEX>. If I use the conventional
method, I am likely to spend <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">eight more minutes</TIMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen</ENAMEX> than if I use
the microwave. So, by using the microwave, I gain <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">eight minutes</TIMEX> outside the
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen</ENAMEX>.

            What is
the value to me of those <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">eight minutes</TIMEX>? I suppose the conventional answer is to
divide my <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> earned income by the number of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> I spend working and so
arrive at the income I could gain by having <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">another minute</TIMEX> at my disposal. In
my case this would be a difficult calculation. The time I spend "working" is
not only the time I spend sitting at my word processor and writing these
essays. It also includes all the time I spend musing about these essays, while
in the shower, or on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bus</ENAMEX>, or trying to fall asleep, and I have no idea how
much time that is in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX>. Anyway, the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">eight minutes</TIMEX> I don't spend in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen</ENAMEX> will probably not be used to earn more income. It will probably be used
to lie down listening to music.

            
On the other hand, the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">eight minutes</TIMEX> I would
have had to spend in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen</ENAMEX> if I didn't have a microwave need not have
been entirely valueless. I could have listened to music, or simply mused--about
an essay like this one or about something else. The basic fact is that at my
advanced age, the best use of time is staying alive. Still, the time spent
outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen</ENAMEX> is probably more valuable than the time spent in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen</ENAMEX>.

            Thus, one
benefit of the microwave is the excess of the value of the time spent outside
the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen</ENAMEX> over the value of the time spent in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen</ENAMEX>. If I bake two
pizzas <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a week</TIMEX> and "save" <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">eight minutes</TIMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pizza</ENAMEX>, that adds up to an excess
value of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">almost 14 hours a year</TIMEX> spent outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen</ENAMEX>.

            There is, for me at least, another benefit. That is the
pleasure of owning, operating, and observing a high-tech instrument. That
pleasure is independent of any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">service</ENAMEX> delivered; it is the pure enjoyment of
the miracle of technology. I <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> observed this with television. It fascinated
me, like it did many others of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX>, even though almost everything we
saw on it was terrible. We were fascinated by the fact that it worked at all.
To a large extent, the Internet is like that. We enjoy surfing the Net just
because it is so amazing, not because what we learn on it is so valuable. There
is some of the same satisfaction in watching a microwave at work.

            What is
the cost of acquiring these benefits? My microwave cost <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$150</NUMEX>. If it lasts for
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 years</TIMEX>, and the interest I could earn on my money is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 percent</NUMEX>, when I bought
it I was facing a cost of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $19</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX>. But once I have bought the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microwave</ENAMEX>, the cost of keeping it is much less. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the basic lessons of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">economics</ENAMEX> is "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bygones</ENAMEX> are forever bygones." What I paid for it is a bygone. Now
the cost of keeping it depends on what I could sell it for. The nuisance of
trying to sell it would probably make that not worth my while. The best
alternative would be to give it to some charitable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>, such as the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salvation Army</ENAMEX>. Suppose I give it to them and can take a charitable deduction
of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$100</NUMEX>. That might reduce my taxes by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">around $50</NUMEX>. The cost of keeping my
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microwave</ENAMEX> rather than giving it away is the sacrifice of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $6.50</NUMEX> a year
plus the sacrifice of the good feeling of having performed a charitable act.
(This costs me <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$6.50</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> rather than <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$5</NUMEX> because by not giving away the
microwave I am foregoing not only the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$50</NUMEX> but also the interest I would have
earned on the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$50</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 years</TIMEX>.)

            
Then, as this calculation might be summarized
in the microeconomics textbook:

            Value <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">per hour</NUMEX> of time spent
outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen</ENAMEX>: <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">X</NUMEX> .

            Value <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">per hour</NUMEX> of time spent
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen</ENAMEX>: <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Y</NUMEX> .

            Value of the satisfaction of
having given a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$100</NUMEX> gift to charity: <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Z</ENAMEX> .

            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Annual</TIMEX> value of the
satisfaction of owning and operating this amazing instrument: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX> .

            Monetary cost of keeping the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microwave</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX>: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$6.50</NUMEX>.

            Number of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> per year of
release from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen</ENAMEX> as a result of using the microwave: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>.

            The question is whether
X minus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX> times <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">14</NUMEX> plus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX> exceeds <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$6.50</NUMEX> plus Z . Of
course, I can't answer this question, because I can't measure W ,
X , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX> , or Z in dollars or any other quantity that is common
to them all.

            (I leave out the further
complication of the cost of electricity for the microwave compared with the
cost of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> for the oven. I live in an apartment <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> where most of these
costs are borne by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 200</NUMEX> other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>, just as I share in their costs.
That is what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> call an "externality.")

            
Nevertheless, despite all these imponderables, I do make a decision. I decide
to keep and use the microwave. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end</TIMEX>, if you ask me why I bought a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microwave</ENAMEX>, why I keep it and why I use it, I can't give a better answer than "I
like it."

            This is, of course, an exceedingly trivial case of
decision-making. But much of life is like that--personal life, business life,
government life. Perhaps it is most like that in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>. We cannot compare
the incomparables and weigh the imponderables. We do what we like, and when we
stop liking it, we change.

            As an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> I am bound to
insist that economics has its value. There are cases, especially in business,
where costs and benefits can be measured in the same <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>--dollars--and
directly compared. Even where that is not true, the differences between costs
and benefits may be so large that fine calculations are unnecessary. Anyway,
the habit of trying to compare costs and benefits is useful, if one does not
insist on trying to apply it where it doesn't work. After all, it was an
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J.M. Clark</ENAMEX>) who warned against an irrational passion for
dispassionate rationality.
