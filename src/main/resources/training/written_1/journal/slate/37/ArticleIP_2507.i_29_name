            As they talk about tax
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">simplification</ENAMEX>, both the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democratic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> have
been enthusiastic about creating disparities among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers</ENAMEX> of similar
incomes--especially when it comes to treating investment income more favorably
than wages. But now many in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> are making a great cause of one particular
differential: the one between married and unmarried <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couples</ENAMEX>. So strong is the
pressure to do something about the so-called "marriage penalty" that the
stalled tobacco bill gained momentum in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</TIMEX> from the inclusion
of a provision to give an income tax break to low and moderate income married
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couples</ENAMEX>.

            For most
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couples</ENAMEX> (those making up to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $60,000</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX>), the main "marriage penalty"
comes from the fact that the standard deduction for a married <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> is less
than the standard deduction for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> unmarried <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>--<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1,400</NUMEX> less for
childless <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couples</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$3,400</NUMEX> less for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couples</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>. If <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> roommates
earn <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$20,000</NUMEX> each, this difference means they will pay <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$210</NUMEX> more in taxes if
they are married than if they are not. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Click</ENAMEX> if you're interested in another
marriage penalty on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">working poor</ENAMEX> that no one seems upset about.)

            Higher income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couples</ENAMEX> typically itemize, so they are not
affected by the standard deduction. But they face rate schedules that are
different for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">singles</ENAMEX> and marrieds. If <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> earn <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$40,000</NUMEX> each, a
decision to get married could, on its face, cost them <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $1,000</NUMEX>.

            But these
kinds of calculations vastly overstate the marriage penalty. Totally
eliminating the penalty would cost something like <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$42 billion</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX>. If
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> wants to reduce or eliminate this penalty, it must either do without
the revenue or make up the difference in some other way. Since married couples
pay <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about three-quarters</NUMEX> of all income taxes, almost all ways of making up the
revenue will place most of the burden right back on married <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couples</ENAMEX>.

            
For instance, that <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$42 billion</NUMEX> could be covered
by a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6 percent</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7 percent</NUMEX> surtax on everyone. But then the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$42 billion</NUMEX> gross
tax cut for marrieds would net out as only about a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$13 billion</NUMEX> cut for
them--accompanied by a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$13 billion</NUMEX> tax increase on unmarried <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers</ENAMEX>. That
works out to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">only about a $120</NUMEX> tax cut for the typical married <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> (and a
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$67</NUMEX> tax increase on the typical single). So, unless you're prepared to load the
entire tax increase on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">singles</ENAMEX>--not likely--you should take all those "marriage
penalty" figures floating around the media and divide them by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least four</NUMEX>
().

            In other words, it's not
logical to measure the marriage penalty by comparing what married <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couples</ENAMEX> pay
now with what they'd pay if overall federal taxes were a lot lower. Saying that
taxes would be lower if taxes were lower is true, but not edifying. The correct
comparison is with a revised tax system that raises as much as current law.

            (Of course, there's the
option of not making up the revenue and just passing a big tax cut for married
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couples</ENAMEX>. But that necessarily entails reducing government services from what
they'd otherwise be, and the losses from that would probably be borne by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">marrieds</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">singles</ENAMEX> in roughly similar proportions to the benefits they'd get
from the tax change.)

            Consider
another example. Blind <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers</ENAMEX> are allowed a larger standard deduction than
sighted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1,050</NUMEX> more for a blind single, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1,700</NUMEX> more for blind married
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couples</ENAMEX>). This tax break costs a piddling <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$30 million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about 24 cents</NUMEX>
per sighted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayer</ENAMEX>. But if we thought of it as a "sight penalty" and
calculated it as the added tax a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> pays now for the privilege of
being able to see, it works out to something like <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$208</NUMEX> per sighted
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayer</ENAMEX>.

            The "marriage penalty" dates back to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1969</TIMEX>. Before that, the
tax code's treatment of married and single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers</ENAMEX> was straightforward. Each
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of a married <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> was considered to enjoy exactly <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> its total
income, and each was taxed on that income at the same rates as single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>.
But this meant that a single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> earning <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$80,000</NUMEX> would pay more taxes than
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> married <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with the same total income (because more of the married
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX>'s income would fall in the lower tax brackets). So in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1969</TIMEX> a new, more
favorable singles rate table was adopted in response to protests that the
system discriminated against them.

            A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> in which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spouse</ENAMEX>
earns all the income is still better off married than never married, at least
for tax purposes. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> whose earnings are roughly equal is better off
unmarried than married. A married <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> that divorces with a separation
agreement to split their combined incomes, including investment income, down
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">middle</ENAMEX> gets the best tax deal of all. Under a progressive tax system, the
only way to eliminate the marriage penalty is to go back to relatively higher
taxes on singles. However you fiddle with the rates, there will always be a
perceived "penalty" on somebody. But calculated honestly, the penalty is a lot
smaller than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> claim.
