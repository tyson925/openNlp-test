            I do not propose to enter
the dialogue between <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinesh D'Souza</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">E.J. Dionne</ENAMEX> about who caused
the golden age <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> is now said to be enjoying. The subject baffles me. I
don't see the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> of causation by which the specific acts of specific
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> are supposed to have led to the results noted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>. If I don't
know what caused the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX>'s death I can't begin to think about whether the au
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pair</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX>? <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>?) did it.

            I would
like to offer some musings on another kind of "golden" condition. I refer to
the golden <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> of private <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>. Between the golden <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>
and those of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nations</ENAMEX>, the connection is, I believe, quite loose. In saying
that, I mean to exclude the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Holocaust</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Great Depression</ENAMEX>, and total war, as
well as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who are exceptionally vulnerable. But within the usual range of
variation of the national <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">condition</ENAMEX>, the difference between a golden national
age and a not-so-golden national age is for most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> unimportant when it
comes to achieving a personal golden day.

            If I had to describe the salient characteristic of a
personal golden day in one word I would say "peace." That is the ultimate
blessing in the key <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Judeo-Christian</ENAMEX> benediction: "<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX> the Lord bless you and
keep you, may He lift up the light of his countenance upon you and give you
peace." I understand peace in this context to mean not the absence of
international violence, or not only that, but a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>'s peace with himself,
with his idea of how he should behave. It includes loving and being loved, and
accepting and appreciating the universe and what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> has created in it.

            I cannot
give a general prescription for achieving golden <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>, but I can give two
examples from my own experience to suggest what some of the ingredients in such
a prescription might be.

            
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">About two months ago</TIMEX>, I was sitting on the
bench at my usual bus <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stop</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Connecticut Avenue</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K Street</ENAMEX>, when a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">policeman</ENAMEX>
escorted a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> or young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> (I couldn't tell which) across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> and
seated her next to me. She was obviously blind, carrying a long white <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cane</ENAMEX> and
keeping her eyes screwed shut. She could hear the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">buses</ENAMEX> coming up to the stop
but didn't know which <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">buses</ENAMEX> they were, so I began telling her their numbers. It
turned out that she was waiting for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bus</ENAMEX> that I was waiting for, the No. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</NUMEX>.
Since she was so anxious about the coming of our <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bus</ENAMEX>, I asked her whether she
had an appointment. She said that she was going to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">George Washington</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> had warned the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> not to come in late.

            I thought of putting her in
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">taxi</ENAMEX>, or taking her to her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> in a taxi. It would not have cost much. But
I was afraid that she would think I was trying to kidnap or molest her.
(There's a comment on our golden age!)

            At last
our <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bus</ENAMEX> came and I helped her up the steps. She indicated that I should sit
next to her and tell her when we came to her <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stop</ENAMEX>. At the stop I helped her
down the steps, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">driver</ENAMEX> kept the door open for me to get back on the
bus. But it was clear that once she was on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sidewalk</ENAMEX> she had no idea of
where to go. I motioned to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bus</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">driver</ENAMEX> to close the doors, took her by the
hand, and led her along <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">G Street</ENAMEX> to the university <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> she sought. Along
the way she told me that she had just graduated from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smith College</ENAMEX> and was
doing postgraduate work in international relations. When I left her at her
building she thanked me, but I said that it was I who had to thank her, because
she had given me the great feeling of being needed.

            That little incident made my day, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several days</TIMEX> to
follow, golden. I had done a deed of "lovingkindness." <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lovingkindness</ENAMEX> is
different from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">charity</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">charity</ENAMEX> can be done with money, but lovingkindness
requires personal involvement. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lovingkindness</ENAMEX> yields a greater reward to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">giver</ENAMEX>. "Sow according to your <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">charity</ENAMEX>, but reap according to your
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lovingkindness</ENAMEX>" (Hosea <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10:12</TIMEX>). Writing tax-deductible checks to charitable
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX> does not make my day golden the way holding that young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX>'s hand
did.

            On my
other example of a golden day, I was out for a walk in the sunshine, and a
stranger on the street complimented me on an article of mine that had been
published in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>. Returning <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">home</ENAMEX>, a little tired but pleased that
I had been able to do the walk, I lay down and turned on the radio, which just
happened to be playing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mozart</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Flute and Harp Concerto</ENAMEX> . I was elated,
and knew that there were a few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> whom I could tell of this feeling with
confidence that they would understand and share my joy. That was a golden day,
brought about by the beauty of nature and of art, the feeling of achievement
and of physical well-being relative to my age, and the connection with a
few--one may be enough--sympathetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>.

            
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golden</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> do not necessarily result from
extraordinary events. They can result from ordinary events happening to people
who are receptive, appreciative, attuned to what is happening around them. A
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>'s psychological and emotional stance, not external events, is what
mainly determines his possibility of enjoying a golden day.

            In my own case, I think that
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three years ago</TIMEX> I would not have experienced the golden days I have described
here. I would have been too shy, or "buttoned down," to take that young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX>'s
hand, and I would have been too absorbed with trivia to appreciate the things
that made me so happy <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few weeks ago</TIMEX>. I suppose it is aging that has changed
my attitude. To resume my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX>'s hat, scarcity confers value, and the
realization that one's days are few increases one's appreciation of their
value. But one doesn't have to be old to appreciate that. Even for the young
the remaining days are few.
