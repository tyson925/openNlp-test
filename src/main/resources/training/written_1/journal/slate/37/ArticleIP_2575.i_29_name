            And none will hear the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">postman</ENAMEX>'s knockWithout a quickening of the heart. For who can bear to feel
himself forgotten?-- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">W.H. Auden</ENAMEX>
            

            How archaic that now sounds,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">technologically</ENAMEX>! And how true it is, psychologically!

            No one
hears the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">postman</ENAMEX>'s knock any more. I can't remember that I ever heard it. At
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX>, I get my mail from a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clerk</ENAMEX> at the desk <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floors</ENAMEX> below my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX>. At
my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>, I either find my mail on a shelf or have it placed on my desk by my
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">helper</ENAMEX>. In either case I don't hear the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">postman</ENAMEX>'s knock or ever see him.

            But the mail--now derisively called "<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">snail</ENAMEX> mail"--is not
the primary means of mediated communication; that is, communication at a
distance beyond face-to-face contact. First, there is the telephone, today
generally equipped with "voice mail," which allows you to retrieve messages
left in your absence. Now, increasingly, there is e-mail, opening up a whole
new world of instantaneous written communication.

            Along with
this technological change have come some changes of attitude. We no longer are
in the position evoked by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Auden</ENAMEX>, passively awaiting a connection with the
outside world through the postman. Now we increasingly seek the connection. We
go to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clerk</ENAMEX> and ask for our mail; we call our answering service to see if
there have been any phone calls; we log on to our computer to search for
messages.

            
With the proliferation of means of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">communication</ENAMEX> has come a degradation of the messages. In my youth, ordinary
mail was the standard means of communication among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who knew each other,
even those who knew each other very well, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>.
Long-distance telephone was reserved for the announcement of births or deaths.
Today, I send or receive hardly any personal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">post office</ENAMEX> mail, except when
printed matter, such as a newspaper clipping, is enclosed. There is one person
with whom I have a fairly regular postal mail correspondence, and that is
because we are both trying to make a literary exercise of our writing to each
other and he, alas, does not have e-mail.

            Whatever
personal communication there is in the mail I receive at home is buried in a
mountain of solicitations for contributions from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX> I
barely know. My usual response to receiving my packet of mail is not <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Auden</ENAMEX>'s
"quickening of the heart." It is more likely to be "ugh!" At my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>, my mail
consists almost exclusively of policy memorandums and pamphlets from
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX> to whom I am but one name on an enormous mailing list. This mail
makes me confront the feeling that I ought to study it all and the realistic
knowledge that I ought to throw it out. Not much "quickening of the heart"
there.

            There is plenty of junk in my e-mail also. When I log on in
the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX>, I am sure to find a couple of messages offering me pornographic
videos with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> click of the mouse, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> message from someone ready
to tell me how to earn <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1,000</NUMEX> an hour working from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX>. But still, the ratio
of personal communication to garbage is higher than for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">snail</ENAMEX> mail.

            The proportion of personal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">communication</ENAMEX> is highest on the telephone. But even there, when the bell rings
and I pick up the receiver I am likely to hear someone asking, "How are you
today, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herbert</ENAMEX>?"--a sure sign of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stranger</ENAMEX> trying to sell me something.

            The odds
against getting a "quickening of the heart" by any of these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> are high. But
despite the odds, I find it worthwhile to try to make the connection. We have
been warned at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment building</ENAMEX> where I live not to disturb the desk
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clerk</ENAMEX> by asking for mail before <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">11:00 a.m.</TIMEX> But I am there at the desk at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">11:01</TIMEX>.
In my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two or three</NUMEX> times a day I look into the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> where the mail is
shelved. I call my home phone from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> at least once a day to see if any
messages have been left. From <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX>, I call my office <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three or four</NUMEX> times a day.
(<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the saddest and most common responses is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operator</ENAMEX> saying, "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herbert</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stein</ENAMEX>, no new messages.") Even more frequently than that I log on to one of my
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> computers, hoping to see the little message on the screen, "You have
mail."

            
Why am I so eager for the connection? It is not
that I expect anything "practical." I am not going to get a letter offering me
a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> figure advance for the publication of a volume of my personal essays. No,
it is as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Auden</ENAMEX> says. I cannot bear to feel forgotten. I seek from the mail or
telephone or e-mail some sign of being remembered--and not just as a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> digit
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> number or a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> digit credit card number.

            The
contents of the communication don't matter. It can be a postcard saying, "I am
in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>. It is hot here." It can be a phone call asking, "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">How are you?</ENAMEX>" It
can be an e-mail message forwarding one of those slightly funny jokes that
circulate around the Internet. What counts is the connection--the feeling of
not being forgotten. Even if the message comes from someone you are sure has
not forgotten you--one of your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, for example--it is a comfort to be
reminded. It is also a comfort if the message comes from a total <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stranger</ENAMEX>, as
long as the message is for you specifically and personally and not for a name
on a mailing list.

            Possibly, I am more avid in pursuit of such connections
than the average <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>. I know <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who don't go down for their mail until
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX>, who have no telephone answering service, and who, even if they have
an e-mail account, don't log on to see their messages for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> at a time. But
still, in one degree or another the feeling described by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Auden</ENAMEX>, of not wanting
to be forgotten, must be nearly universal. Whole industries rest on that
feeling--the greeting card industry and the florist industry, for example.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">AT&T</ENAMEX> knows how important it is. That is why it implores you to reach out
and touch someone.

            In the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> tradition, the
dead live on in the memory of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">survivors</ENAMEX>. Something like that is true for
the living also. The living are most alive when they feel that they are
remembered. That is why I go for my <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">snail</ENAMEX> mail, call for my telephone messages,
and log on to my e-mail--several times <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each day</TIMEX>.
