            I am impressed by the
variety of activities, in addition to walking, that I observe taking place on
the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sidewalks</ENAMEX> in my neighborhood. These activities seem to have increased a lot
in, say, the last <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40 years</TIMEX>.

            I suppose
I <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> became aware of this with the appearance of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Walkman</ENAMEX>. I saw more and
more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> walking around, or jogging, with earphones on. They were listening
to something, apparently--probably music. More recently, I have been struck by
the smoking. There were always <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> smoking on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sidewalk</ENAMEX>, but now there
are clusters of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> around the entrance to every office <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>, standing,
talking to each other, and smoking cigarettes. Then came the cell
phones--<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> walking around holding these little gadgets to an ear,
apparently talking to someone. Finally, to this has been added the
proliferation of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sidewalk</ENAMEX> drinking. I don't mean drinking in the sense of
taking in alcoholic beverages. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are drinking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">soft drinks</ENAMEX>,
or bottled <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Water</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, everywhere, being carried if not being
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">drunk</ENAMEX>.

            The smoking is easy to explain. Increasingly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>, even
whole office <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>, ban smoking. So those who feel a great need to smoke go
down to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sidewalk</ENAMEX>. What is harder for me to explain is the great number of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> in these smoking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. Do <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> have more of a need to smoke or less of
a need to be in their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>, or are there just more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> working in
these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>? Studies show that addiction to smoking is inversely related to
income; low income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are more likely to smoke than high income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>.
Probably the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> working in those <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> have lower incomes, on the
average, than the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>.

            But how to
explain the listening to music on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sidewalk</ENAMEX>, the talking on the telephone,
the drinking of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>? Of course, technology has a lot to do with it. Even in
the case of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, the technology is important. If there weren't lightweight,
unbreakable plastic bottles, there wouldn't be so much water drinking.

            
But these technological innovations would not
have spread so far if they did not meet a demand. There must have been a strong
desire to listen to music while walking or jogging on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sidewalk</ENAMEX>. Yet the
reason for this desire is not clear. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> I see with their headphones on
don't seem to be very happy about what they are hearing. Instead of listening
to music, they could be looking at the other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sidewalk</ENAMEX> or mulling
over private thoughts.

            What are
those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> talking about on their cell phones? I have a cell phone that I
take with me in my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>, when I remember, in case I need roadside help. I have
used it only a few times, to see if it was working. I have never walked along
on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sidewalk</ENAMEX> with it held to my ear. Maybe all these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>--mostly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>, but
I have seen a few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> at it also--are calling their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brokers</ENAMEX> to find out how
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rich</ENAMEX> they are or, more recently, how poor they are. I suppose the cell phone is
part of the information revolution that holds great promise for us, but no one
has ever demonstrated any addition to productivity resulting from the
availability of cell phones.

            Ihave been told that the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> bottles has something
to do with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cult</ENAMEX> of physical fitness. Physical fitness requires the intake
of lots of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fluids</ENAMEX>. But those <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fluids</ENAMEX> could be taken at home, from the kitchen
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">faucet</ENAMEX>. Anyway, many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> I observe do not look as if they were
devoted to physical fitness. And still they hold on to their bottle.

            Bottle! Bottle! Maybe that's
the clue. These are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who do not want to give up their bottle--their
nursing bottle. They want to remain in, or return to, their infancy, when the
nursing bottle was the cure for all discomfort and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">anxiety</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> bottle is
a surrogate for the nursing bottle, which was a surrogate for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mommy</ENAMEX>.

            The cell
phone fits into the same story. It is the way of keeping contact with someone,
anyone, who will reassure you that you are not alone. You may think you are
checking on your portfolio, but deep down you are checking on your existence. I
rarely see <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> using cell phones on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sidewalk</ENAMEX> when they are in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> of other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. It is being alone that they cannot stand. And for many
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, being alone really means being without <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mommy</ENAMEX>. We are raising a
generation that had radio transmitters in its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">nurseries</ENAMEX>, keeping Mommy
constantly informed of every movement of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX> in his crib. We will soon be
walking around with transmitters in our lapels or pocketbooks, constantly
connected via <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">satellite</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mommy</ENAMEX>. And for those whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> are no longer
available there will be constant contact with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bureau of Mommy Surrogates</ENAMEX> in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Health and Human Services</ENAMEX>.

            
And what kind of music are those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pedestrians</ENAMEX>
and joggers listening to on their Walkmans? Music with a clear and steady beat,
much like the lullabies that comforted them as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX>.

            So, it
all fits. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Walkman</ENAMEX>, the cell phone, the water bottle are efforts to regain
the warmth and comfort of infancy and find relief from the loneliness of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adulthood</ENAMEX>. This need is surely not new. I remember the epigraph of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James T.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Farrell</ENAMEX>'s book <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Studs Lonigan</ENAMEX> , which I read <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than 60 years ago</TIMEX>:

            Alone and
afraid,

            In a world I never
made.

            Modern technology--the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Walkman</ENAMEX>, the cell phone, and the plastic bottle--has given us new ways to try
to deal with this old feeling. There are probably worse ways.
