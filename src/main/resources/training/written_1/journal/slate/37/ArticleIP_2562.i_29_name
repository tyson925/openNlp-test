            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of my persistent
fantasies used to be of sitting at a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sidewalk</ENAMEX> table at a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cafe</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX>. I would
be writing with my pen ( <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">la plume de ma tante</ENAMEX> ) in a notebook ( un
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cahier</ENAMEX> ) while smoking a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gauloise</ENAMEX>. I would not be writing economics. One
cannot write economics while sitting at a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sidewalk cafe</ENAMEX>. Maybe that is why
there have been so few distinguished <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX>. I would be writing a
novel, or perhaps poetry, or even a philosophical treatise. But I would
frequently raise my eyes to watch the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> ( les filles ) go by.

            I no
longer have that fantasy. I do, however, eat from time to time at an outdoor
table in front of a small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> leading to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kennedy</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center</ENAMEX>. I don't try to write there. I can't write with <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">la plume de ma</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tante</ENAMEX> . I am addicted to the word processor. I suppose I could use a laptop
computer. But that mechanism would destroy the romantic illusion. Instead, I
watch the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passers-by</ENAMEX>.

            I am not concentrating on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX>. I am concentrating on
the married <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couples</ENAMEX>. How do I know that those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> walking <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">two-by-two</NUMEX>
up to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Kennedy Center</ENAMEX> are married to each other? Well, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">75 percent</NUMEX> of all men
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between the ages of 30 and 75</TIMEX> are married, so if you see a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> in that age
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> walking with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Kennedy Center</ENAMEX>--which is not exactly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Club</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Med</ENAMEX>--it's a good bet that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> are married, and almost certainly to each
other.

            I look
particularly at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> in those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couples</ENAMEX>. They are not glamorous. There are
no <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marlene Dietrichs</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marilyn Monroes</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vivien Leighs</ENAMEX> among them. (It is a
sign of my age that I can't think of the name of a single living glamorous
movie <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actress</ENAMEX>.) Some of them are pretty, but many would be considered plain.
Since they are on their way to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Kennedy Center</ENAMEX>, presumably to attend a play,
an opera, or a concert, one may assume that they are somewhat above average in
cultural literacy. But in other respects one must assume that they are, like
most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, average.

            
But to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> whose hand or arm she is
holding, she is not "average." She is the whole world to him. They may argue
occasionally, or even frequently. He may have an eye for the cute intern in his
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>. But that is superficial. Fundamentally, she is the most valuable thing
in his life.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Genesis</ENAMEX> says, "And the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lord</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">God</ENAMEX> said: 'It is not good that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> should be alone; I will make him a help
meet for him.' " And so, "made He a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>." It doesn't say that He made a
pretty <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>, or a witty <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>, or an any-kind-of-adjective
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>. He made the basic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>.

            Why is
this basic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> so valuable to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> whose hand or arm she is holding as I
see them making their way up to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Kennedy Center</ENAMEX>? I think there are three
simple things.

            First, she is a warm <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> in bed. I don't refer to their
sexual activity. That is important but too varied for me to generalize about. I
refer to something that is, if possible, even more primitive. It is human
contact.

            A baby
crying in its crib doesn't want conversation or a gold <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ring</ENAMEX>. He wants to be
picked up, held, and patted. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Adults</ENAMEX> need that physical contact also. They need
to cuddle together for warmth and comfort in an indifferent or cold world. At
least, they need to be able to do that. The plain <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> and plain <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> I am
watching do that for each other.

            
But conversation is also important. These
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couples</ENAMEX> may have been talking to each other for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30 years</TIMEX> or more. You might
think they have nothing left to say. But still they can talk to each other in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ways</ENAMEX> that they cannot talk to anyone else. He can tell her of something good he
has done, or something good that has happened to him, without fearing that she
will think he is bragging. He can tell her of something bad that has happened
without fearing that she will think he is complaining. He can tell her of the
most trivial thing without fearing that she will think he is bothering her. He
can count on her interest and understanding.

            The
primary purpose of this conversation is not to convey any specific information.
Its primary purpose is to say, "I am here and I know that you are here."

            <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> serves the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>'s need to be needed. If no
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> needs you, what good are you, and what are you here for? Other
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>--<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX>--may say that they need you. But it isn't
true. In all such relationships you are replaceable at some price. But to this
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> you are not replaceable at any price. And that gives you the self-esteem
to go out and meet the world <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX>.

            So this
"ordinary" <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>--one like <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 50 million</NUMEX> others in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>--has this great
value to this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> she is going to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">theater</ENAMEX> with. He surely does not make a
calculation--doesn't mark her to market. He probably never says how much he
values her, to himself or to her. But he acts as if he knows it.

            
Isee that I have written these views entirely
from the point of view of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>. That is only natural for me. But I don't for
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a minute</TIMEX> think that the relationship I have been trying to describe is
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">one-sided</ENAMEX>. On the contrary, I am sure it is reciprocal.

            I can hear you saying: "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">How</ENAMEX>
do you know all this? You are only an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX>, practitioner of the dismal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">science</ENAMEX>. You aren't <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ann Landers</ENAMEX>." That is all true. But my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> and I walked up
that hill to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Kennedy Center</ENAMEX> many times.
