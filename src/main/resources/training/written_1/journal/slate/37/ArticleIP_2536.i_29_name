            No one can say what the
welfare-reform bill will bring, but one unlikely outcome already shows signs of
taking place. Child-care policy may finally receive practical, rather than
polemical, attention. For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than three decades</TIMEX>, social <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> have been
studying the costs and benefits of child care, and their work has yielded only
one consistent result: Their research is seized upon, waved about, politicized,
and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end</TIMEX>, nothing much gets done. But the polarized stalemate can't
continue much longer, for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> reasons. Child care has become an inescapable
public issue, and social <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> themselves have been expressing a new
humility about child-care research. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Politicians</ENAMEX> now have to stop hiding behind
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> and start improvising policy.

            Does the welfare-reform
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bill</ENAMEX> provide enough money to take care of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> whose single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> are now
forced to work? The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lines</ENAMEX> that get drawn on that central question are fairly
predictable. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Liberal child advocates</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Children's Defense Fund</ENAMEX> prominent
among them, regard the funding--<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$20 billion</NUMEX>, available over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six years</TIMEX>--as
almost surely insufficient to offer the poor a true choice of quality day care.
"What we know from child-care research," as a press release from <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Child Trends</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inc.</ENAMEX> puts the standard position, is that "the quality of child care matters for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>'s development, and it matters the most for low-income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>."

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Conservatives</ENAMEX> are content to assume that a majority of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> who leave the rolls will rely on free (or cheap) unregulated child care
by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX>, as the poor have generally done in the past. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ron</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Haskins</ENAMEX>, an influential <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> staff <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Ways and Means</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Committee</ENAMEX>, has been outspoken in invoking social science to defend this
position. The latest research, he argues, has been unable to demonstrate with
any certainty that the quality of day care has much of an impact on a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>'s
future. Why invest more money if it won't make a difference in the long
run?

            The interesting twist here is
that, as far as the science is concerned, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conservatives</ENAMEX> are right, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">liberals</ENAMEX>
lag a wishful step behind when they cite sure proof that early day care
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">decisively</ENAMEX> influences a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>'s development. To make sense of the shakier
expertise both sides now confront, it helps to trace the history of child-care
research through <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> unsettling waves during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past quarter century</TIMEX>.

            The first wave crested
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1970s</TIMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> faced the question: What happens when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX>
work? The mood was apprehensive, the phrasing negative--what harm was
being done to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">babies</ENAMEX> whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> leave them in the care of others?
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Psychologists</ENAMEX> looked at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">maternal</NUMEX>-infant bonding as measured by the so-called
"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Strange Situation</ENAMEX>" test, in which they observed the partings and reunions of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">babies</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> and graded the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX>'s behavior from secure to "avoidant."
All in all, the evidence seemed to suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> who spent more than 20
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> a week in nonmaternal care risked being less attached to their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX>,
and risked displaying uncooperative behavior later in life.

            
When these findings left the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lab</ENAMEX>, they were
promptly construed as political propaganda. They were part of a "backlash
against the women's movement," declared <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandra Scarr</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> of psychology
at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Virginia</ENAMEX> and prominent day-care <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX> (now the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">CEO</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KinderCare</ENAMEX>), in the strident mood of the moment. "The advice for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> has
always been to get out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">work force</ENAMEX>. This is just another way of saying
the same thing."

            The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> wave of studies
followed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1980s</TIMEX>. They were more textured and hopeful, the question behind
them less dour: What kind of nonmaternal care can help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>?
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Longitudinal</ENAMEX> studies sought to measure <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>'s "development"--their language
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">skills</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> achievement, cognitive gains, social and emotional adjustment,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">etc.</ENAMEX>--given different kinds and quality of care in their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early years</TIMEX>. When the
widely varying studies detected short-term benefits from better-quality care,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">liberals</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child advocates</ENAMEX> trumpeted them. Meanwhile, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conservatives</ENAMEX> seized on
findings that such benefits faded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later years</TIMEX>.

            Day-care research since
the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 1990s</TIMEX> has been characterized by what the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> call a more
"ecological" approach. Studies have lately aimed to take into account
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>'s family characteristics--parental living arrangements and attitudes,
income, experience with welfare, etc. But as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandra Scarr</ENAMEX> confessed in a recent
paper surveying the child-care landscape, the results have pulled the rug out
from under <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two decades</TIMEX> of work. Taken together, these studies seem to show
that, given basically safe child-care settings, the quality of care has next to
no measurable, independent effect on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>'s long-term fates. Poor day care
doesn't seem permanently to harm <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> whose lives are otherwise in OK shape.
Nor can good day care be solidly proven to give a dramatic or lasting boost to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> whose <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> lives are a mess. Sometimes it can help, but a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>'s family
appears to be what really counts.

            
In retrospect, it's clear that earlier studies
made too much of small effects on development that were derived from very small
samples. The complex interaction between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> and day-care situations--to say
nothing of individual temperaments--defies ready measurement. But where does
that leave us? <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Liberals</ENAMEX> and child-care <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocates</ENAMEX>, no longer armed with evidence
to bolster their demands for big investments in child-care quality, have two
choices. They can either rely on outmoded studies to argue with conservative
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX>, who, for the moment, have the more authoritative pretext for
scrimping on day-care cost and quality. Or they can follow the example set by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scarr</ENAMEX>. Acknowledging the new research (and doing some of it herself), Scarr
still champions quality, but now on more immediate, less quantitative grounds.
Her approach points the way for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">liberals</ENAMEX> to gain credibility by shedding the
onus of being "social <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineers</ENAMEX>," and take their turn at playing the populist
anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX> card.

            
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Liberals</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child advocates</ENAMEX> can now explain,
as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conservatives</ENAMEX> have before them, that social policy isn't about enforcing
officially approved "choices." They can say that, regardless of what the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> tell us, it's perfectly obvious that cheap care by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> shouldn't become the only feasible alternative for struggling
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Parents</ENAMEX> can make the best decisions for their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>, and if they are
looking for quality day care, it isn't likely to be because someone in a lab
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">coat</ENAMEX> tells them it will mean an IQ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.6</NUMEX> points higher at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 15</TIMEX>. It will be
because they hope it may mean a happier, more secure week for their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX> and a
less anxious one for themselves. What's more, the chance to take an active
choice in the matter as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> may itself be a step toward the more
successful, better monitored arrangements that poor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">working parents</ENAMEX>--and more
middle-class <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>, too--say they need and want.

            A similarly pragmatic spirit
beckons on the conservative side. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gov.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tommy Thompson</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wisconsin</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mayor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rudolph Giuliani</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>, the conservative vanguard on the issue,
show no inclination to exploit research that says, in effect, Why care about
day-care quality? Instead they're busy scrounging for funds to spread good care
more widely. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thompson</ENAMEX> recently came up with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$25 million</NUMEX> more for "affordable
quality child care" as welfare <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers head</ENAMEX> to work--<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$20 million</NUMEX> to ensure that
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">working poor</ENAMEX> aren't edged out of the subsidized care they count on, and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$5</NUMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">million</NUMEX> to increase the supply and quality of overall care. Of course, this
decision raises plenty of questions of its own. Is <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$25 million</NUMEX> more going to be
enough in a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wisconsin</ENAMEX>? How should that money be used--on more
informal arrangements or on more <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">day-care centers</ENAMEX>, on stiffer regulations or on
other financial incentives to improve quality? On some of everything? The
political debate over those questions will be more practical and less
ideological, paradoxically enough, if scientific claims about a long-term
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">payoff</ENAMEX>, or the lack of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>, are left out of it.
