            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last month</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Communications Commission</ENAMEX> dialed in a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1.275 billion</NUMEX> subsidy to help <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">libraries</ENAMEX>, and rural health care providers purchase Internet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">service</ENAMEX>. The
program, which will help pay for Internet access and internal data wiring at
the educational and health <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX>, resurrects a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two century old</TIMEX> debate in
the political economy: What services should the federal government
subsidize?

            Under
the rubric of "universal service," the feds already require business and urban
phone <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> to subsidize rural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> to the tune of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1.7 billion</NUMEX>. Some
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> mandate phone discounts for the poor and make up the difference by
boosting other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX>' bills. In the name of universal service, the federal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rural Electrification Administration</ENAMEX> spends <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$33 million</NUMEX> subsidizing electric
power for upcountry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX>. And since its inception, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> has
subsidized postal service to rural addresses at the expense of urban
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX>.

            
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Universal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">service</ENAMEX>'s original proponents
maintain these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">services</ENAMEX> are so essential to modern civilization that it would
be unconscionable to allow the market to price them beyond the reach of the
less affluent. In that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spirit</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> currently believes the
Internet--which just <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few years ago</TIMEX> was considered a luxury --is now a
necessity .

            The
merits of universal telephone and postal service aside, there are several
strong arguments against an Internet subsidy:

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) You can
live and learn quite handsomely without access to the Internet.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) Many of
the poorer rural <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> that have applied for the subsidy lack the high
speed phone lines that make the Internet worthwhile, keeping them Internet
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">have-nots</ENAMEX>.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) Where
fast rural lines are available, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> can scarcely afford
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">textbooks</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">periodicals</ENAMEX>, let alone new computers and training for Web
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">surfing</ENAMEX>.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) However well-meaning
the new subsidy, technology is moving so fast that the old regulatory
apparatus--based on permanent scarcity and obstacles of distance--don't apply
to the Internet.

            If the
federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> is serious about making Internet access affordable to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>, it should disconnect this program.

            
The Internet "e-rate" subsidies, as they're
known, were authorized under the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1996 Telecommunications Act</ENAMEX> and are funded
with new taxes on long-distance telephone <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>, the size of each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>'s
contribution depending on its market share. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCI</ENAMEX> have protested the
tax and pledged to pass the cost on to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCI</ENAMEX> charges <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 percent</NUMEX> on all
out of state long-distance calls, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX> charges a flat rate. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX> has
received <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30,000</NUMEX> e-rate applications and expects to start handing out funds this
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX>.

            In
places like rural <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alabama</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mississippi</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Louisiana</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arizona</ENAMEX>,
where there are no high speed Internet lines, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> might be willing to
settle for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">POT</ENAMEX> (plain old telephone) connections to the Internet at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">56 kps.</TIMEX> But
few Internet service <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX> serve rural <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>, because the current number
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> is too small for them to make money. For these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX>'s e-rate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> recommends dial-up services like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AOL</ENAMEX> that offer <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">800</NUMEX>
access at a pricey <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10 cents</NUMEX> a minute premium. If you connect <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12 hours a day</TIMEX> and
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six days a week</TIMEX> to the Internet via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AOL</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">800</ENAMEX> line, you'll pay <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$22,727.40</NUMEX> a
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> (assuming an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AOL</ENAMEX> service rate of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$21.95</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a month</TIMEX>).

            
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> with the maximum allowable e-rate
subsidy of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90 percent</NUMEX> would still find itself paying a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</TIMEX> Internet bill of
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$186</NUMEX>. That might not sound like a lot of money, but it's <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$186</NUMEX> many strapped
local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> don't have. And if they did have it, they'd spend it on
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">periodicals</ENAMEX>, new books, or capital improvements. As previously mentioned, the
e-rate discount won't cover any portion of the hardware bill either, leaving
the local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> responsible for PCs, modems, and training for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">supervisors</ENAMEX>.

            The
e-rate plan also mistakenly imagines that high speed, affordable Internet
service will never reach rural <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> without government help. Perhaps the
e-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">raters</ENAMEX> think technology is still crawling along as it did when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Theodore Vail</ENAMEX>
cut his monopoly deal. Instead, the cost of computer gear is falling
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">precipitously</ENAMEX>, and affordable <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bandwidth</ENAMEX>--the measure of data transmission--is
growing at an exponential rate. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Click</ENAMEX> for a graph that illustrates the growth
in bandwidth.)

            
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greenlee County</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ariz.</ENAMEX>, public library
illustrates the money and technology woes of rural <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX>. The three
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">libraries</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greenlee</ENAMEX> (population <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8,000</NUMEX>) operate <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> PCs, one of which is
dedicated to public access--word processing, CD-ROM access, and the like.
Greenlee <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">librarians</ENAMEX> are the only ones who can access the Internet, and they do
it sparingly, over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>' one phone line to a free <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arizona State</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Library</ENAMEX> connection. How much could <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Greenlee</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> afford to pay to bring
greater Internet access? "Anything that costs <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than 5 cents</NUMEX> is
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">prohibitive</ENAMEX>," says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Head Librarian Rebecca Oliver</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Next year</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> budget of
less than <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$100,000</NUMEX> must cover <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staffers</ENAMEX>' salaries and other expenses.

            Today,
nobody disputes the argument that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vail</ENAMEX>'s telephone <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monopoly</ENAMEX> stifled
technological innovation. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> round of telecommunications deregulation in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the '70s</TIMEX> that opened long-distance service to competition benefited consumers
and spurred innovation. Likewise, since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1982</TIMEX> court order that dismantled
the AT&T monopoly, the market has produced new and affordable technologies
that have revolutionized telephone service. Do we really want to ghettoize
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rural</ENAMEX> Internet service as a welfare operation when the best telecommunications
policy seems to be to let the market work instead? <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cable</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">satellite</ENAMEX> TV
didn't require subsidies to serve rural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX>. Why should the Internet?

            
Already, technologies are emerging that reduce
Internet access costs and increase bandwidth for rural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DirecPC</ENAMEX> and other
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> now provide Internet access via satellites that boast download access
speeds of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to seven</NUMEX> times that of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">POT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">connections</ENAMEX>. The cost is <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$200</NUMEX> for the
satellite dish hardware and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$29.95</NUMEX> a month for service. Several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>, such
as @<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Home</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Warner</ENAMEX>, are marketing high speed Internet access over cable
TV lines, with a national rollout of the service <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">only a couple of years</TIMEX> away.
Currently, cable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lines</ENAMEX> run past <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">97 percent</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> homes, and many small
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> have a cable TV <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">provider</ENAMEX> in their central <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">districts</ENAMEX> where schools
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> are. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> has even experimented with transmitting data
signals over common electric power lines--and at speeds of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">up to 1 megabit</NUMEX> a
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>, which is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">150 percent</NUMEX> faster than even <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DirecPC</ENAMEX>. If this technology
proves successful, it would make much of the telephone-based part of the
Internet obsolete almost <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">overnight</TIMEX>.

            If the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last two decades</TIMEX> of
deregulation have proved anything, it is that subsidies are easier to avoid
than they are to repeal. Also, subsidies reallocate resources that would be
better spent elsewhere. As bandwidth continues to grow exponentially and the
price of hardware continues to fall, rural <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX>,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> will become a lucrative market. The e-rate might look like the
answer to rural and poor <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>'s technology problems, but it isn't. Good
things come to those who wait.
