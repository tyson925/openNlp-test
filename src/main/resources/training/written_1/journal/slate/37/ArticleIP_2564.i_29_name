            Wanting to share the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> experience, I have just acquired a TV satellite dish. I am now
prepared to report on my venture into this brave new world that has so many
channels.

            You have
probably seen ads telling of the marvels we can bring into our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> by
acquiring a dish free or, in the ad to which I responded, for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$100</NUMEX>. (All prices
in this world end in <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">95 cents</NUMEX>, so this price was actually <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$99.95</NUMEX>, but for
convenience I am going to round everything off.) You and I were not born
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX>, and we know that no one is going to give us such a valuable and
sophisticated product so cheaply. We have read the fine print and know that we
get the dish at such a low price only if we subscribe to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">service</ENAMEX> providing
the content for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one year</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$30</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a month</TIMEX>. Moreover, since this is a new and
mysterious gadget, it is prudent to get a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three-year</TIMEX> repair <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">service</ENAMEX> contract
costing <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$120</NUMEX>, and the thing needs to be delivered, which is another <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$30</NUMEX>. And so
far we haven't counted the cost of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">installation</ENAMEX>. That is "basically" <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$200</NUMEX>, but
in my special case, for reasons that may not be so special, the installation
cost was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$350</NUMEX>. Not surprisingly, everything is not going to work just right the
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time, and though you are well covered by warranties you are going to
spend <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">many hours</TIMEX> on the telephone while "our entertainment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX> are
serving other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX>." Valuing my time at the minimum wage, I calculate my
investment of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> in getting started at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$100</NUMEX>. So I now have a fixed cost,
excluding the cost of content, of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$700</NUMEX>.

            In order to get started I had to sign up for a package of
content costing <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$30</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a month</TIMEX>. That, however, was a minimum package, and there
were many other more expensive options. In fact, to get fairly representative
coverage, but with little sports coverage, I soon found myself up to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $80</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a month</TIMEX>. Amortizing my fixed costs over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36 months</TIMEX>, the whole thing was coming
to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $100</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a month</TIMEX>. Is that a lot or a little? <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">About 5 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> now
think the satellite dish is worthwhile, and the number is growing. A larger
number are paying nearly that much a month for cable, with fewer channels than
are available on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">satellite</ENAMEX>. There are great economies of scale. For a household
of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$100</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a month</TIMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$20</NUMEX> per capita.

            What do we
get for this? That is hard to tell. The system provides minimum guidance to
what can be seen. One can scroll through a guide on the screen that tells what
is showing on each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX>, but the information given is minimal. The names of
movies are shown, but not what they are about, who is in them, when they were
produced, or any indication of their quality such as one would get in a
newspaper listing. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> click on the name of any currently running movie will
bring it up on the screen, but without any additional information except for
its rating (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>, PG, etc.). Unless one is exceedingly well informed about movies,
or quite indifferent, one can surf around for quite a while and only reach a
movie one wants to watch after it has already begun. These problems can be
somewhat eased by a subscription to the special satellite edition of TV
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guide</ENAMEX> , but that is also an enormous maze of options.

            
After long and tedious research I am able to
report on the content of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">207</NUMEX> channels available with the packages I have,
or at least what was available during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">prime time</TIMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one evening</TIMEX>.

            Ninety-nine of these
channels provided no content to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subscribers</ENAMEX>. That included <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX> blank channels,
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> channels containing advertising for the system or schedules of coming
events, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> channels of broadcast <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stations</ENAMEX> generally available free without a
satellite dish but requiring payment with the satellite dish, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX>
channels duplicating what was being shown on other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX>. Also there were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX>
channels airing music without any picture. These <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> were very finely
classified--<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1970s</NUMEX> hits, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1980s</NUMEX> hits, several varieties of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rock</ENAMEX>, several
varieties of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, and so on. I consider that to be essentially similar to
what can be obtained on the radio in most places.

            Of the
remaining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">108</NUMEX> channels that had some content, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">56</NUMEX> were showing movies, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45</NUMEX> for
free, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> for pay. The fee for the pay movies was low, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$3</NUMEX> if your satellite
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dish</ENAMEX> was connected to your phone line; otherwise <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$8</NUMEX>. A quick scroll through the
movies suggests that their quality is about what you would find in your local
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">theaters</ENAMEX> on any given day--many awful, some fair, and a few good. That is no
surprise, because almost all the movies have been in your local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">theater</ENAMEX>. The
pay movies were no better than the free movies, only somewhat newer. A person
who wants to stay home to see a movie on any <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>, or even on <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">every night</TIMEX>,
should find something amusing. For oldies like me the most intriguing channel
is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Turner</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Classic Movies</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">One morning</TIMEX> I came across a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1927</TIMEX> movie called
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Love</ENAMEX> , with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Greta Garbo</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Gilbert</ENAMEX>. It was really <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anna</ENAMEX>
Karenina ! But even I don't want to watch those old movies for more than a
few <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX>.

            The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> channels devoted to sports, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of them for pay,
were a surprise to me. I hadn't expected so much space to be devoted to rugby
(<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> channels), fishing, beach <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">volleyball</ENAMEX>, stock-<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> racing, and ballooning,
but I suppose there are those who love these activities. More access to
standard events is available in deluxe packages beyond what I paid for.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Eleven</NUMEX>
news <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> all have pretty much the same news. I generously classify <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX>
channels as "education," including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> channels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C-SPAN</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Discovery</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Channel</ENAMEX>, a health <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX>, and a few others. Then there is a smattering of
other things--shopping, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX>, housekeeping, cartoons, religion, and so on. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Comedy Central</ENAMEX>, carries a new program, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Win Ben Stein</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Money</ENAMEX> , for which
I confess a special interest. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> described in the brochure as
"tasteful adult programming for mature <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audiences</ENAMEX>" I can vouch for as being very
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clean</ENAMEX>. All the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> look as if they just stepped out of the shower.

            
The technology of satellite TV--<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">one 18-inch</NUMEX>
dish on the deck of my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX> receiving <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">207</NUMEX> channels from something flying
in space <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">thousands of miles</NUMEX> away--is wonderful. The programming is less
wonderful. But still, I can't complain about what is there. I do, however,
wonder about what is not there. When there are so many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> available, why
is so little space devoted to education and art? My own little corner of the
world, policy wonking, is an example. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">think tanks</ENAMEX> long to get their
programs on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C-SPAN</ENAMEX>, but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C-SPAN</ENAMEX> has space for only a few of them. Another
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">channel</ENAMEX> devoted to such talk could well interest as many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> as want to see
a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1928</TIMEX> movie starring <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Conrad Nagel</ENAMEX>, and would not hurt them. And that only
scratches the surface of possible educational programming. On the arts side,
there are videotapes of great performances of great operas. Could they take the
place of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">56</NUMEX> channels of movies? I recently acquired a wonderful
videotape of ballet with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Suzanne Farrell</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baryshnikov</ENAMEX> (produced,
incidentally, with support from the much-maligned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Endowment for the</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arts</ENAMEX>). I can imagine a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> devoted to such productions. My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> will certainly tell me that if such programming would pay off it would
be done. But there is more to life than economics.

            These
last musings raise in my mind another question, a long way from the cute
<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">18-inch</NUMEX> dish on my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">deck</ENAMEX>. Many estimable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are devoting themselves to
ridding our popular culture of obscenity, sex, and violence. Who is devoting
himself to enriching our popular culture with high art?

            

               POSTSCRIPT: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> more <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX> with my cute TV satellite dish have increased
my appreciation of it. I have learned to find my way around better, although
that is still a problem and I think that a technology that can deliver so much
information should be able to provide better guidance on the screen and not
require reference to a printed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX>. I have found that when the incoming
music is routed through my stereo, I get excellent sound. Just accidentally,
while surfing and without any prior notice, I came upon a broadcast of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Don</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giovanni</ENAMEX> that was very good. I assume that the whole thing was being
broadcast, although I came in at the beginning of the last act. There were no
pictures. And I have finally sat through a whole movie. It was a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1937</TIMEX> version
of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Prisoner of Zenda</ENAMEX> , with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald Colman</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Douglas Fairbanks Jr.</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Raymond Massey</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Niven</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madeleine Carroll</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Astor</ENAMEX>. They don't make
casts like that any more. I remain of the opinion, however, that the content is
far short of the potentialities of the technology.
