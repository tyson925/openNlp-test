            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last Friday</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Naumann</ENAMEX>, the unusually candid and big-spending German
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor-in-chief</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Henry Holt</ENAMEX>, cut short the mounting gossip that he was about
to be fired by quitting. He left to become, of course, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politician</ENAMEX>--Culture
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Minister</ENAMEX> in the shadow <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cabinet</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gerhard Schroeder</ENAMEX>, who's a good bet to defeat
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chancellor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helmut Kohl</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this fall</TIMEX>. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Naumann</ENAMEX> told a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX> radio
station that he opposed the giant <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Holocaust</ENAMEX> memorial planned for the center of
that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, designed by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Eisenman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Serra</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>,
said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Naumann</ENAMEX>, should spend its money preserving its crumbling concentration
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">camps</ENAMEX>, "a landscape of death [that] is considerably more moving and has
considerably deeper effects than a memorial"--especially since, he added, that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">memorial</ENAMEX> is reminiscent of nothing so much as the works of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hitler</ENAMEX>'s favorite
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albert Speer</ENAMEX>.

            Yikes! <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Culturebox</ENAMEX> knows from having once casually tossed the words "Final
Solution" into some light <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> cocktail banter that, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>, you don't
invoke a name like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Speer's</ENAMEX> in vain. On the other hand, when she looks at the
endlessly-debated project with its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,000</NUMEX> ominous, towering, concrete slabs,
Culturebox can't help suspecting that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Naumann</ENAMEX>'s right. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Click</ENAMEX> here to see for yourself.)

            As it turns out, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> papers lost interest in the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Holocaust</ENAMEX>-memorial angle
as soon as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Naumann</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boss</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schroeder</ENAMEX>, announced that the question of its future
would be resolved by public debate. But the buzz has not died down. In the same
radio interview--the first the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> had ever heard from him--Naumann
also outlined the startlingly ambitious program he'd undertake if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schroeder</ENAMEX>
were elected: federalizing the arts budget in a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> in which the arts are
mainly supported by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>; revitalizing the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> film industry by
calling on his <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pals</ENAMEX> to import more <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> films, and so on.

            As you can imagine, these proposals have been amply dissected and nitpicked
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all week</TIMEX> by every <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Culturebox</ENAMEX> has managed to Nexis up. Their
main spin: Who the heck is this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> anyway? Is he "a fresh wind from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>,"
as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> paper put it, or a would-be "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Culture Pope</ENAMEX>," which is to say, an
American-style media <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hound</ENAMEX> whose appointment should make <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> think
twice about electing his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boss</ENAMEX>? Culturebox, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> who appreciates the
journalistic value of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> of unusual candor, sincerely hopes that the German
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> do not.
