            There is a peculiar rumor circulating that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stanley Kubrick</ENAMEX> expired while
clutching a fax from a top <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner Bros.</ENAMEX> executive congratulating him on his
recently screened <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Eyes Wide Shut</ENAMEX> . That this was a favorable
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">missive</ENAMEX> is what makes the report so mordant, so mysterious. Caustic rumors
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Kubrick</ENAMEX> are at the heart of his legacy--especially his modern legacy,
since his films of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last two decades</TIMEX> have come <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">so many years</TIMEX> apart and have
been so not-worth-the-wait. His name has become an adjective for overcontrol.
It is said that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kubrick</ENAMEX> sent his scripts--or pages thereof--around in plastic
bags, to be read by the intended <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipient</ENAMEX> and then returned via hovering
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">messengers</ENAMEX>. Security around <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Eyes Wide Shut</ENAMEX> was likened to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Alamos</ENAMEX>,
except we now know that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> penetrated <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Alamos</ENAMEX>. No one outside
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Warners</ENAMEX> knows much about the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Cruise-Nicole Kidman</ENAMEX> thriller set to be
released on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 16</TIMEX> after an eyes-wide-opening <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15 months</TIMEX> of shoots and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reshoots</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Paranoia</ENAMEX> isn't the worst vice a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> can have.
Nor is ruthless <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">perfectionism</ENAMEX>, although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kubrick</ENAMEX> tested that theory. On The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shining</ENAMEX> , after the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX>-somethingth take of a simple shot in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jack</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nicholson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shelley Duvall</ENAMEX> did little more than cross a busy street,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nicholson</ENAMEX> reportedly approached the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> and said, "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Er</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stanley</ENAMEX>, I normally
peak on the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">63</NUMEX> rd take." There were apparently no accidents, happy or
unhappy, on a late <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kubrick</ENAMEX> movie--no messy intrusions of life, no funk. These
were <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">giant</ENAMEX>, hermetically sealed constructions. And they were all <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kubrick</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acquaintances</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> film industry report that on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> when Kubrick
didn't feel like directing, production of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eyes Wide Shut</ENAMEX> shut down. What
would be the point of coming in?

            Those who've had experiences with amphetamines can
recognize some characteristics of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kubrick</ENAMEX>'s oeuvre : the brilliance and
exactitude of individual sequences in what was often a sour, fuzzy whole. The
upshot of such control, however, is that each film is sui generis , each
with its own unique architecture, its own singular--and vastly
influential--cinematic metaphor. The tight, clockwork construction of his early
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">masterpiece</ENAMEX>, the heist drama <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Killing</ENAMEX> , is gloriously in sync--and
then bitterly at odds--with the robbery's unraveling. The waltzing
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">impersonality</ENAMEX> and blurriness of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX> make the dismantling of its most
human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX>--the computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">HAL</ENAMEX>--more vivid than any other death in modern
movies.

            Even those of us who think <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Shining</ENAMEX> was a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">botch</ENAMEX> can appreciate its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Steadicam</ENAMEX> tricycle treks around that huge, empty
hotel, which capture indelibly the circular, labyrinthine evil at the heart of
the story. Even those of us who despise Full <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metal Jacket</ENAMEX> will not shake
off the effects of its formally brilliant, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">45-minute</TIMEX> opening boot-camp
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX>, in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> are mechanistically stripped of their individuality to
prepare them to go forth and kill. I'll despise <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kubrick</ENAMEX> forever for associating
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beethoven</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ninth Symphony</ENAMEX>, "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Singin' in the Rain</ENAMEX>," and some of the most
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">glorious</ENAMEX> works of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Handel</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Purcell</ENAMEX> with sadomasochism and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>'s inhumanity to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>. But even at his most glibly nihilistic, in A 
               Clockwork
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Orange</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kubrick</ENAMEX> foresaw the punk movement in a way that makes the overused
term visionary seem an understatement.

            An omniscient <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spellbinder</ENAMEX> who was also cynical and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">limited</ENAMEX>--that's not the worst legacy a filmmaker can have, especially one who
gave us some of our culture's most enduring visions of the absurdity of war,
both satirical ( <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Strangelove</ENAMEX> ) and gruelingly earnest ( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paths of</ENAMEX>
Glory ).

            In an autobiography, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kirk Douglas</ENAMEX>--who worked with
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spartacus and Paths</ENAMEX> 
               of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Glory</ENAMEX> --remembered a
nasty, credit-hogging character, less noble and more commercially ambitious
than he has subsequently been depicted. That's at odds with the portrait of a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who was, for better or worse, a pinnacle of integrity. While his movies are
thought of as huge (they are certainly hugely expensive), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kubrick</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crews</ENAMEX> were
legendarily tiny--in many cases <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">no more than 15</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>--and the director
himself would go around arranging the lights in the manner not of a deity but
of an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">electrician</ENAMEX> or plumber. Where most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> think of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kubrick</ENAMEX>'s films as
having been storyboarded to death--predigested--others report that he often
wandered his sets with a camera lens, groping for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">shots</ENAMEX> on the spot. He spoke
in an engaging nebbishy <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bronx</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> accent that was always a shock to
hear--like the voice of the unmasked <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Wizard of Oz</ENAMEX>, it didn't belong. On his
sets he wore the same <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outfits</ENAMEX>; it is said that, like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Einstein</ENAMEX>, he had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> or
more of each lined up on hangers. The act of making choices was clearly
excruciating to him; that's why the choices he made are so
memorable.

            
               --<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Edelstein</ENAMEX>
            

            There's a fear of greatness in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> pop
culture--of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> who outlast their moment of young promise and insist on
developing a personality. I can't think of any other explanation for the cruel
tone that has entered into the obituaries for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stanley Kubrick</ENAMEX>, one of the last
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">filmmakers</ENAMEX> who painted images in a grand style. An obituary in the New York
Times used the word cold <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times, and for good measure added
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">chilly</ENAMEX> , icy , bleak , and grim . Kubrick the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Cold</ENAMEX> is a
clich√© that cropped up in the columns of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pauline Kael</ENAMEX> and now serves as a comfy
sofa for those who don't want to deal with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kubrick</ENAMEX>'s ambition. Certainly, he
was not a warm, cuddly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX>, but what great <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> ever has been? The
best of his films-- The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Killing , Lolita</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Strangelove</ENAMEX> ,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Shining</ENAMEX> are wearing especially well--provide a peculiar kind of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">exhilaration</ENAMEX>. They make me happy, they make me laugh. I'm responding not only
to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX>'s generous wit but also to his bravado. These movies are
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">visual</ENAMEX>, musical, and verbal dances in which even the most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minor player</ENAMEX> and the
tiniest detail move to the main tune. If this was cold, then so was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fred</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Astaire</ENAMEX>.

            The question is: What is art supposed to do for us?
Should it make us feel better about our lives, show us friendly mirrors? In
that case, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kubrick</ENAMEX> was no good. But if art is supposed to open up strange
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">vistas</ENAMEX>, make us think twice about the ordinary, then <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kubrick</ENAMEX> was a big deal.
His most uncanny disclosures came not in the obvious transcendentalism of
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX> but in The 
               Shining --which, barring some last miracle
in the forthcoming Eyes Wide 
               Shut , ought to be his masterpiece.
( <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Eyes Wide Shut</ENAMEX> is already a conceptual masterpiece insofar as it
locked up <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Cruise</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> on end and lost <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">millions of dollars</NUMEX>.)
Here <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kubrick</ENAMEX> took a seemingly worn-out genre, the haunted-house chiller, and
found <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozens</NUMEX> of new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">corridors</ENAMEX>. Look at it again and see it how pins down
formulas of everyday life. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Nicholson</ENAMEX> shouts workplace banalities while waving
his bat: "Have you ever thought for a single solitary moment about my
responsibilities to my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employers</ENAMEX>?" The TV keeps up an endless, sinister
JonBenet chatter: "The search is still on for that missing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aspen</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>." Just
the light in the movie is amazing: all that blinding snow, all those fades to
white. (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edmund Burke</ENAMEX>'s "light which is converted into a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> of darkness.")
How many pretentious, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">earth</ENAMEX>-toned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> catering to "all the best <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>"
remind you of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Shining</ENAMEX> ? It's cold out there, sometimes.
