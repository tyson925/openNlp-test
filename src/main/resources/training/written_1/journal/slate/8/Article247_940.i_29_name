            The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Booker Prize</ENAMEX> has been so controversial that you can't call it <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX>'s
most prestigious fiction prize. But it's still the best-flacked. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ian McEwan</ENAMEX> won
it in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November</TIMEX> for his <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">192</NUMEX>-page <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> , which has just been published
here. It's a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX>. It's also decidedly minor.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McEwan</ENAMEX> has never been my favorite <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX>. I'll assent to the critical
commonplace that he's a narrative virtuoso. But like a docent at his own
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">retrospective</ENAMEX>, he's ever insistent that we notice that virtuosity. The
spectacular opening of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Enduring Love</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>), in which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a half-dozen</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>
struggle--and fail--to keep a hot-air balloon from taking off with a small boy
in it, is Exhibit A for his skill. But even there, the cuteness cloys: "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">What</ENAMEX>
were we running towards? I don't think any of us would ever know fully. But
superficially the answer was, a balloon. Not the nominal space that encloses a
cartoon <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX>'s speech or thought, nor, by analogy, the kind that's driven
by mere hot air."

            Clearly, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> owes its <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Booker</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committee</ENAMEX> embarrassment over
not tapping (or even shortlisting) <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Enduring Love</ENAMEX> . It's rather like the
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Nobel</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committee</ENAMEX>'s honoring <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hemingway</ENAMEX> for his vapid <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Old Man and the</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sea</ENAMEX> . This leads me to realize that "minor" is most often used as a
synonym for "bad" or "short." It's not. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Old</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Man</ENAMEX> are both bad, short, and minor works. So what does it mean to call a
novel "minor"? Herewith, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> guesses:

            (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Minor</ENAMEX> means solipsistic . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McEwan</ENAMEX>'s plot is a contrivance of
infantile simplicity worked out among <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX>. (I won't reveal it, but
you can see the book's resolution comin' round the mountain on page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">62</NUMEX>.) These
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> meet occasionally, but they all hammer out their motivations,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">allegiances</ENAMEX> and enmities in private: on long walks, doodling in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vegetating</ENAMEX> in bed, sitting at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen</ENAMEX> table getting drunk alone. Missing is
what the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> call intersubjectivite . That's what gives major novels
their heft.

            (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Minor</ENAMEX> means classbound . Although they differ in lines of
work--there's a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Tory</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">foreign</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX>, a broadsheet <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">composer</ENAMEX>, and a
magnate--these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> are class- and attitude-bound. They're like the same
character cloned. While the backdrops vary--the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">magnate</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> is utilitarian
and spare, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">musician</ENAMEX>'s full of antiques--the spiritual decor is as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cold</ENAMEX> as a
corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX>. Major fiction is animated by major friction--of classes
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rubbing</ENAMEX> together.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McEwan</ENAMEX>'s aging yuppie <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ciphers</ENAMEX> differ only in their wine collections. I
suspect they give an accurate picture of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of human variety among the
ruling classes of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Union</ENAMEX>. Good novels can be written about these
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. So can long ones. But not major ones.
