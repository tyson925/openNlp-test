               <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">All</NUMEX> times
are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eastern</ENAMEX>, but check your local listings just in case.
            

            It's cold outside; the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Midwest</ENAMEX> is neck-deep in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">snow</ENAMEX>;
there are no good movies opening <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</TIMEX>; the post-<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">holiday</TIMEX> sales are all
over. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Happily</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the week</TIMEX>'s TV line-up provides several decent alternatives to
getting out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and actually doing something.

            Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewers</ENAMEX> recognize that, in terms of
entertainment quality, the tag line "It's not TV. It's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HBO</ENAMEX>" is basically
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">meaningless</ENAMEX>, particularlyin the post-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry Sanders</ENAMEX> era. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HBO</ENAMEX> is just as likely
to serve up dreadful programming as any other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX>. That said, the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HBO</ENAMEX>
series The 
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sopranos</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sun.</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:00 p.m.</TIMEX>) may well be worth the price
of a signal unscrambler. The show revolves around the middle-aged angst of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jersey</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mob boss</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tony Soprano</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">James Gandolfini</ENAMEX>). In addition to obsessing over
problems with his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>, and elderly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Soprano</ENAMEX> is depressed that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">golden</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">la cosa nostra</ENAMEX> have passed him by. Plagued by panic-attacks, he
starts seeing a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">psychiatrist</ENAMEX> (a pleasantly low-keyed role for the usually
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">grating Lorraine Bracco</ENAMEX>). The series has everything you watch cable
for--violence, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>, profanity, automatic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX>, topless <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dancers</ENAMEX>. Gandolfini
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fans</ENAMEX> will be particularly pleased to see how well he's made the transition from
supporting-cast tough <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">True Romance , Get Shorty</ENAMEX> ) to
center-stage tough <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX>. He captures the show's mix of darkness, humor, and
humanity--without slipping into the criminal-with-a-heart-of-gold clich√©. Start
watching <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">now</TIMEX>; the early episodes are wonderful, but the scent of "short shelf
life" hangs in the air.

            Those without premium channels need not despair. Also
debuting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eddie Murphy</ENAMEX>'s animated series, The 
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PJs</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fox</ENAMEX>,
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:30 p.m.</TIMEX>). In addition to executive producing the show, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Murphy</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stars</ENAMEX> as the
voice of the main <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thurgood Stubbs</ENAMEX>, the smartass <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">super</ENAMEX> of an urban
housing project. Early rumblings are that The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PJs</ENAMEX> delivers precisely
what you'd expect from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murphy</ENAMEX>: harsh, brash, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100 percent</NUMEX> politically
incorrect humor. (The ghetto jokes have already prompted protests from black
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activist groups</ENAMEX>.) But even if the show stinks, you should watch at least one
episode so you won't feel left out of the cocktail party/water cooler
blathering about the social implications of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> black animated series to
hit <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">prime time</TIMEX>.

            Western <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">junkies</ENAMEX> may want to give <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNT</ENAMEX>'s much-hyped
Purgatory a shot (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sun</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:00 p.m.</TIMEX>). Don't misunderstand--it's not great.
The basic concept is hokey, if mildly original: A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">band</ENAMEX> of old-west nasties
stumbles into a strange <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> populated by the souls of dead <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">outlaws</ENAMEX> doing
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">penance</ENAMEX> in the hopes of earning a seat on the great stagecoach to heaven. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">To</ENAMEX>
illustrate this, a big black stagecoach magically materializes at key <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">moments</TIMEX>.)
The execution is even more problematic: There is an abundance of bad acting,
heavy-handed moralizing, obvious dialogue--and, of course, the obligatory
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">elderly Indian</ENAMEX> skulking about to highlight the mysticism of the situation. On
the plus side, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eric Roberts</ENAMEX> is well cast as the irredeemable head nasty, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sam</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shepard</ENAMEX> is charming (as always) as a penitent <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wild Bill Hickok</ENAMEX>, and the grand
finale involves a gratifying, albeit predictable, shoot-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">em</NUMEX>-up sequence. Keep
your expectations low.

            Perhaps to atone for all the repeats we've endured in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past month</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> are wheeling out new episodes of The
X <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Files , The Simpsons , Everybody Loves Raymond</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">King of</ENAMEX>
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hill</ENAMEX> , The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> of 
               <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Queens</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Law & Order ,</ENAMEX> 3rd
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rock</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Ally McBeal , Melrose Place , Homicide</ENAMEX> , NYPD
Blue . ... And for those who get <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNN</ENAMEX>, there's a special treat: the return of
roller derby. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:00 p.m.</TIMEX> marks the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">inaugural</ENAMEX> telecast of the World
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Skating League</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RollerJam</ENAMEX>. It has all the power and poetry of traditional
roller derby, but with that extra oomph made possible by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s in-line
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">skates</ENAMEX>.

            Heavily promoted events best left unwatched: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gene</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilder</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MFTV</ENAMEX> movie, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Murder In a Small Town</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A&E</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sun.</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:00 p.m.</TIMEX>),
the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">25th</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">People's Choice Awards</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sun.</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:00 p.m.</TIMEX>), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 26th</TIMEX> annual
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Music Awards</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mon.</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:00 p.m.</TIMEX>)--although the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Burt Bacharach-Elvis</ENAMEX>
Costello duet promises to be riveting--and, of course, the "ultimate milk
squirt off" <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">on Guinness World Records Prime Time</ENAMEX>, in which grown <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> snort milk
up their noses and shoot it out their eyeballs (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fox</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tue.</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:00 p.m.</TIMEX>). Though
my gender has many flaws--its affection for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ally McBeal</ENAMEX> being among the most
disturbing--I take comfort in the fact that the viewship of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guinness</ENAMEX>'s weekly
freak parade is predominantly male.

            All things considered, the viewing situation looks
solid. But if nothing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</TIMEX> grabs you, take heart: The lockout is over, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBA</ENAMEX> action should be coming your way soon.
