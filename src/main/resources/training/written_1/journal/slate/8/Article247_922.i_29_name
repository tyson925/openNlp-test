               Feeling terrorized by cuteness? The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last few years</TIMEX> have witnessed <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Beanie</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Babies</ENAMEX> and ravers in pacifiers and pigtails and the box-office success of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Antz</ENAMEX>. Now even hi-tech is morphing into cute-tech. Consider <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Volkswagen</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">new Beetle</ENAMEX>, a shiny bubble of a thing whose tag line in print ads wonders: "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Hug</ENAMEX>
it? Drive it?" Or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>'s iMac, with its cheery translucent green casing that
seems to declare, "Unlike all those complicated computers that try to
intimidate you, I have no secrets." The latest foray into cuteness is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intel</ENAMEX>'s,
the chip <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX> having recently unveiled the design for a machine it
wants hardware <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> to make. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intel</ENAMEX> "concept computer" struggles
mightily to be cute despite its distinctly uncute name: "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Legacy Removal Concept</ENAMEX> PC." It's a loud red or blue or green
computer-in-a-box which is goofily reminiscent of an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Aztec</ENAMEX> pyramid.

               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intel</ENAMEX>'s strained effort to please makes the whole cute-machine thing
slightly painful, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Culturebox</ENAMEX> predicts that cute is more than a passing fad
in industrial design. Cute might seem downmarket, given the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associations</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> usually want to attach to their top-flight computers and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX>--you
know, power, speed, precision engineering, the building blocks of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">masculinity</ENAMEX>. And huggable machines do seem custom-tailored for technophobes,
which in the electronics and automobile <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX> is often a coded reference
to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beetle</ENAMEX> does have that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plastic bud vase</ENAMEX>. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ron Lawner</ENAMEX>,
the advertising <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>'s marketing campaign, denies that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> was targeting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>: "I don't think the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> is not macho. It's just
more approachable than either the more boring <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> or the more
pretentious high-priced <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX>."

               In fact, another theory of cute machines holds that not only are they not
downscale, they're aimed at the high end of the market. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chee Perlman</ENAMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">editor-in-chief of I.D. Magazine</ENAMEX> , says all her ultra-sophisticated
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designer friends</ENAMEX> were "early adopters"--that is, they rushed out to buy the new
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beetles</ENAMEX> and iMacs. The little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">suckers</ENAMEX> were just so risky, so anti-corporate, so
pro-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX>; their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturers</ENAMEX> just seemed so hip. "The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beetle</ENAMEX> almost
looks like it's smiling at you," she says.

               Maybe. Me, I still see a bug in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">service</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hitler</ENAMEX>'s favorite <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>.
But in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sharon Stone</ENAMEX> is willing to play an <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ant</ENAMEX>, you have to
admit that even bugs sell as long as they're cute. Why fight it? <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cute</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> and
computers are personable, friendly, marginally less annoying than the clunky
monsters of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 70s</TIMEX> and much less annoying than the creepily sleek, black
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Powerbooks</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Civics</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Camrys</ENAMEX> of the early <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nineties</ENAMEX>. Now we just have to get
past the man-machine barrier and figure out how to chuck these cutie <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pies</ENAMEX> under
the chin.
