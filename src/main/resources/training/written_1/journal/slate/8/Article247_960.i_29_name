            Good <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morning Andrew</ENAMEX>,

            In this morning's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> headlines, ''Astronomers Say a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Disk</ENAMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dust Holds a Clue to Birth of Planets</ENAMEX>.'' <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Three years ago</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> learned
that other suns also have planets. Now they think they are actually able to
understand how planets are formed from stellar debris. According to the paper,
it's looking more and more likely that there is life on other planets.

            Are you with me in adding outer space to our list of boring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>? Last
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> I wrote a column in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Nation</ENAMEX> confessing that I didn't care what
kind of rocks <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mars</ENAMEX> had and neither did anyone else I knew. Wrong again-it
turned out almost everyone I knew found this sort of information utterly
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fascinating</ENAMEX>, and many of them wrote in to say so.

            Now, archeology, on the other hand-there's a science. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX>'s New York
Times obituary page carries an article about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Linda Schele</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 55</NUMEX>, very
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">sad</ENAMEX>), who as a young <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">studio</ENAMEX> art <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> paid a visit to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> in
l970 and fell in love with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mayan</ENAMEX> ruins. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">l973</TIMEX> she knew so much, that in
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three hours</TIMEX> working with an undergraduate, she was able to decipher <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mayan</ENAMEX>
inscriptions that had baffled <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX>. It turns out that the
Mayans were not, as previously thought, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> of dreamy stargazers but (the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">old</ENAMEX> story!) violent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enthusiasts</ENAMEX> of war, torture, human sacrifice and painful
blood-letting rituals, ''whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX> was required to stick a rod through the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">shaft</ENAMEX> of his own penis on ceremonial occasions.'' Sounds like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Performance Art</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Night</TIMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mineshaft</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Cheers,</ENAMEX>
