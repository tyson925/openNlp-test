            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michel Houellebecq</ENAMEX> is a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40-year-old</TIMEX> computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">programmer</ENAMEX> who emerged from a
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> mental hospital <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a decade ago</TIMEX>, started publishing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">poems</ENAMEX>, and branched
out. His <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> novel, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Les</ENAMEX> particules elementaires , concerns two
desperately lonely <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brothers</ENAMEX>. One is a sex <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">maniac</ENAMEX>, the other a genetic
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researcher</ENAMEX> who seeks through cloning to make sex obsolete. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> have more in
common than it sounds--which is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Houellebecq</ENAMEX>'s point, sort of. The book has sold
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several hundred thousand</NUMEX> copies and launched the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> real <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> literary
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">spat</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Particules</ENAMEX> has already got <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> write-ups you might have seen: a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Yorker</ENAMEX> piece on the affaire by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adam Gopnik</ENAMEX> and a driblet in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TLS</ENAMEX> . Both seek the source of the book's controversy in its politics.
Houellebecq was kicked out of his <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> literary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coterie</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Les Perpendiculaires</ENAMEX>,
on those grounds. But if his politics are right-wing, it's not in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">French</ENAMEX>
anti-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dreyfusard</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">poujadist</NUMEX>-lepenist line. No, these are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">'90s</NUMEX> issues. Houellebecq
rails at materialism--both consumerist and sexual. He especially damns the
places where the two overlap, like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>, abortion, and penile and breast
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">implants</ENAMEX>. But the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> soon notices that these diatribes are being delivered
in the course of lengthy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gang</ENAMEX>-bang descriptions--which are lovingly, even
excitedly rendered. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reviewer</ENAMEX> who, like this one, is shaky on his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">French</ENAMEX>
idioms, will learn all sorts of words, like se branler for "whack off,"
partouze for "orgy," and branlette espagnole for . . . Sorry,
that's where I draw the line. But finish this book and you'll have no trouble
reading the menu in any <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> whorehouse.

            How does <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Houellebecq</ENAMEX> reconcile his paeans to random sex with his lament over
the world it leaves in its wake? By viewing both as stages on the way to a
eugenicist paradise. Houellebecq even reads <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Huxley</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brave New World</ENAMEX> as
a u- , not dys- , topia. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">And</ENAMEX> defends his point with considerable
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">documentation</ENAMEX> and brilliance on pp. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">193-201</ENAMEX>.) Here's a sum-up of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Houellebecq</ENAMEX>'s
thinking on the matter:

            (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) without God and/or a belief in progress, life's a torture;

            (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) still, sexual liberation's worth trying as a consolation;

            (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) but it doesn't ultimately satisfy, so forget about it. Let's clone a
new

            race and get the hell out of here.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frederic Badre</ENAMEX> calls Particules "<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first 21st-century</TIMEX>
novel" and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Houellebecq</ENAMEX> "the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">novelist</ENAMEX> who is not a humanist." <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> hopes
(and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">suspects</ENAMEX>) that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Houellebecq</ENAMEX> is describing not la condition humaine
but la <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">condition francaise</ENAMEX> .
