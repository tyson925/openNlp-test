            The giggles were excruciating. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monica Lewinsky</ENAMEX> took such obvious delight in
regaling us with details of her encounters with her sexual soulmate--her wide
eyes <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crinkling</ENAMEX> happily, her full mouth struggling vainly against a triumphant
grin at the impressive number of times he called--you felt you'd wandered into
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lord</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Flies</ENAMEX>, the female version . What adultless <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX> did
this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> come from? Could she possibly believe her teen fantasies of secret
love? Is sucking the presidential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">penis</ENAMEX> really to be her greatest
accomplishment in life?

            The probable answer is yes. You could see this realization dawning on
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barbara Walters</ENAMEX>' grave face. At least you hoped that's what you were seeing.
You hoped <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walters</ENAMEX> was feeling some pity for the life thereby wasted, was
suppressing a grandmotherly impulse to shut this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> up. For what was much
more gruesome than the spectacle of the giddy <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX> was that of the cynical
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walters</ENAMEX>. Having sat the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> down in her den; having posed with a social
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">worker</ENAMEX>'s concern questions still unthinkable in their prurience--"Did you ever
try to have intercourse?"; having exploited an insecure <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>'s lack of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">internal</ENAMEX> censors to help a network score a ratings coup, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walters</ENAMEX> turned
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">blithely into Linda Tripp</ENAMEX>. It was the primal scene of maternal betrayal, the
older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> eliciting the confession all too easily from the younger <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> and
then using it to make her the laughingstock of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walters</ENAMEX> asks
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX> to imagine hypothetical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX> tells them that "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mommy</ENAMEX> made
a big mistake"; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walters</ENAMEX> concludes with a stunning outburst of moral hypocrisy,
"And that is the understatement of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX>."

            Let's correct the record here. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX>'s was not the biggest mistake made
over the course of this debacle. She is guilty of a lot of small ones. But it
is not a crime to have an affair with a married <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> and then be indiscreet
about it. Her behavior was stupid and hurt a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, but if the point
here is to measure the size of her errors, they are barely perceptible next to
those of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who ruined her: a literary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> with profit and something
akin to treason on her mind; a federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecutor</ENAMEX> who chose to hound and harass
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizen</ENAMEX> with overweening <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> and little justification; and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalists</ENAMEX> who
cooperated by exposing every last detail of her private life.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> today joined much of the rest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">censuring Lewinsky</ENAMEX> for cashing in on her fame. That can't be right. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Lewinsky</ENAMEX>
did not choose her notoriety. Being a blabbermouth doesn't mean you've sought
national <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">exposure</ENAMEX>; it means you're a blabbermouth. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX> did not ask to be
saddled with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds of thousands</NUMEX> in legal fees. She could not have known that
messing around with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> meant losing the likelihood of economic
independence when <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> comes, as one hopes it will, when she finally
achieves the emotional maturity to take care of herself. But not even Bill
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> is to blame for that, or for her understandable need to make herself
human after having been reduced to a national joke. One can pity her for
neither seeing the unsettling impression she creates nor grasping that there's
no way to talk about the affair that will restore some measure of dignity to
her life. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monica</ENAMEX> is road kill here, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walters</ENAMEX> the latest in a series of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hit-and-run</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drivers</ENAMEX>, and there is something sickening about the way we have
watched this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> be knocked down again and again and again, yet still feel
the need to vilify the object of our voyeuristic pleasure.
