            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrew</ENAMEX>--So, given your commitment to lots of medical care, am I right to
assume that you oppose cuts in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> health care budget? Maybe if the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX> wasn't so cheap your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dentist</ENAMEX> would have sprung for some <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Novocaine</ENAMEX>.

            I wasn't defending small health-care expenditures. I'm all in favor of
everyone getting everything they need . I was making a point about health and
health care as related to other social values. For instance, awful as your
childhood dental experience was, at least you had a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dentist</ENAMEX>! In this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>,
lots of people can't afford any kind of dental care (it mostly isn't covered by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicaid</ENAMEX>) and are just out of luck.

            What's the situation with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who are <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> positive and don't have private
health insurance that pays for the drug regimen? I think I remember a news
story which said they were getting too expensive for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicaid</ENAMEX>. And the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who have neither private insurance nor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicaid</ENAMEX>--what happens to
them?

            Talk to you soon,
Katha

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS</ENAMEX>. I love <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX>. Better <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a thousand</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">nights</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sushi</ENAMEX> than a single
meal of baked <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beans</ENAMEX> on toast. Your portrait of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> is funny, but if they were
really as timid and mingy as you suggest, they wouldn't be so healthy and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">long-lived</ENAMEX>. (Unlike the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX>, who I think are not so healthy in general.)
We're always reading about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>'s weird side--the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">businessmen</ENAMEX> reading
sado-porn comics on <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX> train, and schoolgirls moonlighting as
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">prostitutes</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> eating potentially fatal blowfish just for kicks. And, of
course, the incredible level of sexism, conformity, pollution, hideous modern
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> and so on. I'll bet their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX> carry the same sort of stories
about us.
