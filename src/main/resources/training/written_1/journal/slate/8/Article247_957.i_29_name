            Katha,

                   Oh, God. We're agreeing again. Since when was sport a crucial civic
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">virtue</ENAMEX>?? Even egghead effete sheets like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> dedicate a
whole section <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">most days</TIMEX> to it, as if it meant anything real or interesting, or
wasn't a lowest common denominator entertainment. You're right about stadiums
as well. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DC</ENAMEX> just shelled out a fortune for a new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCI</ENAMEX> stadium downtown, and a
new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Redskins</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stadium</ENAMEX>, and every idiotic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">newsman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> is required to nod
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">knowingly</ENAMEX> when the sports <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> makes some obscure reference to some impenetrable
<ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">football</ENAMEX> play, and anyone like me who finds the entire exercise faintly
ridiculous is regarded as unpatriotic and unmanly. IF <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DC</ENAMEX> spent an ounce of the
mental energy it expends on sports on education then the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> might be livable
once again. And the only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> more boring than sports <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stars</ENAMEX> are movie
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actors</ENAMEX>.
       My own theory is that sports are one of the very few ways that most
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heterosexual</ENAMEX> (and some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homosexual</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> can communicate with each other about
anything other than the weather. They cannot talk about their feelings; and
they cannot really hang out in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three or less</TIMEX> (someone might think
they're gay); and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> confuse and frustrate them. So ... how about those
Skins? Yes, there are some aspects to sports that are beautiful and admirable;
and <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">baseball</ENAMEX> in this regard is on a different <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> than football; and soccer
is even more engaging. (I won't bore you with an appreciation of a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five-day</TIMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cricket</ENAMEX> match). But in general, these are definitely what Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mill</ENAMEX> would have
called lower pleasures. And we need to do a better job of keeping them in their
place.
       On a more troubling level, the sports fetish is also a crude way of
defining masculinity down. I went to a high school (all male, and not one of
those fee-paying buggery <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinics</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Masterpiece Theatre</ENAMEX> ) where the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rugby</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> were gods. But they weren't the only male role models. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> still
had a place for the masculine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholar</ENAMEX>, or debater, or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientist</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> seems
to me to have allowed for these other pursuits but to have avoided seeing them
as part of being male. (It's bound up, at some level, with a fear of
homosexuality, I suppose.) This means that the minute the american male has a
crisis of masculinity, he looks to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brett Favre</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reggie White</ENAMEX> for guidance.
This is extremely troubling.
       But are you as interested in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX> pages as I am?

            best
