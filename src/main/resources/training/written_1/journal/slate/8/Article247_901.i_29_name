            Were he alive, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dwight Macdonald</ENAMEX>, archenemy of all
things low-and middlebrow, would be rubbing his hands with malicious glee. What
could be more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Midcult</ENAMEX> than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Modern Library</ENAMEX>--populist <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">purveyor</ENAMEX> of affordable
classics--making a list of
the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> greatest English-language novels of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past 100 years</TIMEX>? Or the
presence on it of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thornton Wilder</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Macdonald</ENAMEX>'s very definition of the Midcult
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>? And there's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Random House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bennett Cerf</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher Cerf</ENAMEX>,
going on network television to advance the defense <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Macdonald</ENAMEX> mocked in his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1960</TIMEX>
essay "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Masscult & Midcult</ENAMEX>"--that cheap marketing devices like lists are
justified if they mean that more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> read more books.

            Had anyone thought to put <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Culturebox</ENAMEX> on TV, she too
would have defended the list, though on different grounds. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Culturebox</ENAMEX> is an
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">avowed</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fan</ENAMEX> of the great <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> huckster tradition, whence <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Modern Library</ENAMEX>
stems. Among its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founders</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albert Boni</ENAMEX>, flush from his invention of the
leather-bound edition of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare</ENAMEX>, so inspired a flash of marketing genius
it was deemed worthy, by the candy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whitman's</ENAMEX>, of inclusion in
every box of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chocolate</ENAMEX> sold. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1917</TIMEX>, the raison d'etre of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Modern Library</ENAMEX> was
to offer cheap reprints of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> fiction. Today, its main claim to fame is
that it provided its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bennett Cerf</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Klopfer</ENAMEX>, the financial
underpinnings of a far greater publishing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">venture</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Random House</ENAMEX>.

            The moral of that story is: If you know how to market
your backlist, you get to do the kind of publishing cultural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> like
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Macdonald</ENAMEX> praise you for. That maxim is as true <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">now</TIMEX> as it was then. Which is
why <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Modern Library</ENAMEX>'s list is, as such things always are, brilliant. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Irksome,</ENAMEX>
middlebrow, replete with weird choices and intellectual pretention--who cares?
Who can criticize it without advancing its agenda? <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Culturebox</ENAMEX> would have been
reduced to silence if she hadn't been moved to applaud.
