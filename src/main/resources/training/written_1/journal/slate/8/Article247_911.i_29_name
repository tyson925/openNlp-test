               The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chronicle</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Higher Education</ENAMEX> reports that linguists have
invented a computer program that understands <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> writing. That would be a
welcome advance in civilization, had it not also opened a window on the corrupt
bargain between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professors</ENAMEX> when it comes to teaching basic
literary skills in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> place.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Intelligent Essay Assessor</ENAMEX> (an Orwellian misnomer, of course) is based
on a form of artificial intelligence called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSA</ENAMEX>--latent semantic analysis,
explained in detail on this website. In brief--<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bear</ENAMEX> with me here--the program first compares
reference materials to sample essays which have been graded by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX>,
then compares the sample essays to student essays. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> don't have to
use particular keywords for the program to figure out what they're talking
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about</TIMEX>; it has a wide vocabulary. As for grading, "[<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">I</ENAMEX>]f an essay appears to
convey the same knowledge as verifiably good essays, the computer gives it a
good score. If a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX>'s work looks similar to a poor essay, it gets a low
score."

            Here's what the IEA catches: <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Students</ENAMEX> who never read the assignment in the
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> place; plagiarists; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who try to beat the program by packing the
essay with relevant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">keywords</ENAMEX> but not stringing them together in any meaningful
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX>. Here's what it doesn't catch: "clever turns of phrase or creative
approaches to an assignment." But isn't that the essence of higher education?
Wrong! <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">This month</TIMEX>'s issue of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Demographics</ENAMEX> reports that more
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> than ever don't give a fig about clever turns of phrase or creative
approaches to assignments. They want big financial aid packages and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assurance</ENAMEX> of a good job after graduation. Once they get into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> of
their choice, they study less than they ever have. "College <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> want to
reap what they consider to be the maximum benefits -- money and social status
-- for the minimum amount of work," says the study's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>.

            This suits <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professors</ENAMEX> just fine. They've told the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chronicle</ENAMEX> that
they're grateful to have their workload lightened by a computer. And why
shouldn't they be? They're not graded on how well they teach; they're graded by
the number of articles they publish in research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX>. Deepening the
intellectual understanding of the next generation, or just teaching it to
compose a decent sentence, seems to be the last thing on anyone's mind. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Colorado</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Mexico State University</ENAMEX>, quick to grasp that
their role is to funnel <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> into professional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> and high-income
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">jobs</ENAMEX>, not to burden them with fine points of style, have already adopted the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Intelligent Essay Assessor</ENAMEX>; so has the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Graduate Management</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Admission Test</ENAMEX>. It
won't be long before the rest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> does too. So, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>, it's a deal:
We won't teach you how to write, and you won't object that you can't.
