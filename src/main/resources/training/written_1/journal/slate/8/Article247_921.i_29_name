            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruno Doesseker</ENAMEX> is the real name of a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Swiss</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> known to the world as
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Binjamin Wilkomirski</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latvian Jewish</ENAMEX> concentration <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">camp survivor</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">memoirist</ENAMEX> who is now accused of having wholly fabricated his harrowing tale of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">toddlerhood</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camps</ENAMEX>. When I read about him <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier this week</TIMEX> in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> , I immediately  sided with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX>--whatever his name
was. I hadn't read the book, but I remembered the reviews. Here was an author
hailed by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> shaken <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critic</ENAMEX> after another for the literary quality of his
horrific prose. His book (his <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>) had been instantly promoted to the first
ranks of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Holocaust canon</ENAMEX>. What did factuality have to do with artistic
merit?

            Before you write me off as a waffling postmodernist, let me remind you that
publishing fiction as truth is an enduring tradition in world literature,
dating back to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early days</TIMEX> of the novel, a genre deemed suspect because it
involved telling lies. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the greatest novels in any language, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Robinson</ENAMEX>
Crusoe , was published by an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robinson Crusoe</ENAMEX>--not by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daniel</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defoe</ENAMEX>--and passed off as a factual tale. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> picaresque tales that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cervantes</ENAMEX> harvested in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Don Quixote</ENAMEX> were published as autobiography.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark Twain</ENAMEX> parodies this custom in the opening paragraph of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Huck Finn</ENAMEX> ,
when he has Huck assure the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Adventures</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Sawyer</ENAMEX>
was true, even though written by this other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fellow</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark Twain</ENAMEX>: "There was
things which he stretched, but mainly he told the truth."

            Before <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilkomirski a.k.a. Doesseker</ENAMEX> was exposed--his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nemesis</ENAMEX> was another
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Holocaust</ENAMEX> memoirist, bitter at his lack of comparable  success--he traveled
around the world giving seminars on the memory-recovering techniques that led
to his "discovery" that he was a <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Holocaust</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">survivor</ENAMEX>. That was
snake-oil-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">salesman</ENAMEX>-ish of him, but still. All those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reviewers</ENAMEX> couldn't be
wrong. I couldn't wait to get my hands on this mischievously category-defying
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">masterpiece</ENAMEX> and savor the higher truths that emanated from its pages.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alas</ENAMEX>, read as a novel, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Binyamin Wilkomirski's Fragments</ENAMEX> is maudlin
and obvious. The device of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>'s point-of-view would have had no
credibility if the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> hadn't sworn to having had the memories himself.
First he apologizes for the book's fragmentary nature; then he proceeds to
recount the most neatly sewn-up <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Holocaust</ENAMEX> tale I've ever read. Every step is
taken in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this three-year-old</TIMEX>'s progress toward ultimate horror. Every detail is
in place, although the childish narrator professes not to understand them.
There's the death of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>. The story of hiding in a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">farmhouse</ENAMEX> where the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">farmer</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> is raped by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldier</ENAMEX>. On it goes: How the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> was separated
from his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brothers</ENAMEX>. The motherly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guard</ENAMEX> who took him to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camps</ENAMEX>. His life in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">barracks</ENAMEX>. A visit to his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>. How he survived when everyone else died.
How he ended up in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Switzerland</ENAMEX>, alone and wildly misunderstood. As fact, it's
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">implausible</ENAMEX>: No <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> who had gone through what he had gone through by the age
of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> would have remembered every key element this specifically. As fiction,
it's banal: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven Spielberg</ENAMEX> couldn't have written a more helpfully linear
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">screenplay</ENAMEX>, or given us the eyes of a more heartbreaking innocent to view it
through..

            This raises the question of why so many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> were so moved by so many
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clich√©s.</ENAMEX> It's not hard to understand, I suppose. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wilkomirski/Doesseker</ENAMEX> traffics
in the most appalling subset of the most gruesome atrocities known to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">humankind</ENAMEX>--the brutal degradation and casual annihilation of uncomprehending
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>. We've been primed to pity by other <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Holocaust</ENAMEX> classics, many of
which-- The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diary</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anne Frank</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Painted Bird</ENAMEX> ,
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Night</TIMEX> --also involve <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, as if only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> could give adequate
testimony to the horror of what took place. It is all but impossible
to retain critical equanimity in the face of such things, especially when we
know that what <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wilkomirksi/Doesseker</ENAMEX> tells us, was, in its rougher outlines,
true.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fragments</ENAMEX> does us the favor of filling in more of those
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">outlines</ENAMEX>, but with only marginally more artistry than a network
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">newsmagazine</ENAMEX>-style "reconstruction." It's too bad. I can't help wishing
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wilkomirksi/Doesseker</ENAMEX> had been more subtle in his efforts at deception and
produced the magnificent fraud world literature deserves.
