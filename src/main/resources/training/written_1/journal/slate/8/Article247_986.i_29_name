            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dear Katha</ENAMEX>,

            No, I don't think <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> is heading for elysium, or that the free market
solves every problem (it just bypasses some of the more avoidable ones). But
nor do I think some wrenching social and economic difficulties in a
still-nascent constitutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">democracy</ENAMEX> are comparable to forced starvations,
reigns of terror, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Gulag</ENAMEX>. They're a necessary evil, like a de-tox
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tremor</ENAMEX>, not like an arbitrary jack-boot in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX>.

            Nor do I think there is or was any faint comparison between the evils the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> sponsored during the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Cold War</ENAMEX> (and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> undoubtedly sponsored some)
and what the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviets</ENAMEX> did. Sorry, but what the West imposed on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Western Europe</ENAMEX>
was nothing compared to what the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviets</ENAMEX> did in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eastern Europe</ENAMEX> or the entire
Eurasian continent. I thought, given what we now know, that this was
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">uncontroversial</ENAMEX>. I'm interested to see you still don't think so.

            As to my win-win situation, I don't get your point. My view is that
Thatcherism largely worked and was therefore all but coopted by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Labour</ENAMEX>.
Yes, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tories</ENAMEX> had been in power too long and got kicked out for sleaze and
exhaustion. But the difference between what another Major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> would have
done, and what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blair</ENAMEX> has done is, I think, infinitesimal. So I'm disappointed
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tories</ENAMEX> didn't go on for ever, but hardly worried. And so far, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blair</ENAMEX> has
been terrific on most of the important issues.

            Maybe I should apologize for my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">distemper</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this morning</TIMEX>. I didn't mean to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">re</ENAMEX>-fight the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Cold War</ENAMEX> over <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX>. Something just came over me. I certainly
think the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Right</ENAMEX> has plenty of post-ideological problems of its own (and Safire
is as cranky about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> as many on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Left</ENAMEX>.) But I think the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Left</ENAMEX> has some
even more thorough accounting to perform than the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Right</TIMEX>. It seems to me that in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>, that process is underway. But in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>, it still lags.
Meanwhile, nihilist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clintonism</ENAMEX> rules, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gingrichism</ENAMEX> yaps. Could it
be that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Left</ENAMEX>'s refusal to pore over its often shameful and mistaken past
has something to do with this political impasse?
