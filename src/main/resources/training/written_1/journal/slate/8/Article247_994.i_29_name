            Katha,

            Oh, come on. You're the sly <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>, telling me I should like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> for
"bashing the poor" as if welfare reform was anything of the kind. I was just
responding in kind.

            Of course, you're right about the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> context to our being soft on
communism. We do have nice, fuzzy memories of those lefties in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1930s</TIMEX>. And
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stalin</ENAMEX> was, of course, our <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">ally</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War</ENAMEX> II. Nevertheless ... Remember what
those 30s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communists</ENAMEX> were excusing in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Soviet Union</ENAMEX>--a hideous state terror.
Are we fuzzily indulgent of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fellow</ENAMEX>-traveling <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Nazis</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1930s</TIMEX>? Of course not.
And think also of what <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> Communism extracted from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>
decades: stupendous military and economic resources, which could have been far
better spent elsewhere; a morally corrupting political <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX> over the
response to communism; the deaths of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">many thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vietnam</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Korean</ENAMEX> wars; and the continuing threat of nuclear devastation for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX>.
Even the deficit of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1980s</TIMEX> seems to me to be essentially a consequence of a
final military buildup to defeat the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviets</ENAMEX>. Why, I wonder, are we not more
enraged by this? Is it entirely magnanimity in victory?

            I think it's because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Left</ENAMEX> has done a good job of white-washing the evil
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">empire</ENAMEX>--even now--and associating collectivism with good rather than bad
things. Think of the fuss when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> used the e-word. Do you now concede he
was completely right? We've also, I think, become beaten down with state power
in a way previous generations would have been shocked by, and so numb to the
Left's continuing assault on individual economic freedom. We think there's a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">spectrum on the Left</ENAMEX>--nice, cuddly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Dealers</ENAMEX>, who have nothing to do with
nasty fascist <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviets</ENAMEX>--whereas on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Right</ENAMEX>, there's merely, er, racists. But
of course, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stalin</ENAMEX> was not a red fascist, he was a totalitarian socialist.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hitler</ENAMEX>, too, was, one recalls, a national socialist and an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enemy</ENAMEX> of the free
market as well as the free society. The slipperiest slope, in other words, as
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hayek</ENAMEX> predicted, is still on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Left</ENAMEX>. Anyone really prosperous and
hard-working in this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> now has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost half</NUMEX> their money expropriated by
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1910</TIMEX>, that would have been regarded as little short of communism.
Why do we now accept it as a given?

            So we're soft on them because your side has done a brilliant job at spinning
the terrors of the far left, and because we have slowly acquiesced to an
increasingly powerful <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> which has sapped <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> of their outrage at its
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rapaciousness</ENAMEX>. So we laugh at young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communists</ENAMEX>, and are sickened by young
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fascists</ENAMEX>. We should be sickened by both equally.

            unrepentantly,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrew</ENAMEX>
