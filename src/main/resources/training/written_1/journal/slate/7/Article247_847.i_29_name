            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Angeles Times</ENAMEX> leads with the imminent death of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jordan</ENAMEX>'s beloved King
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hussein</ENAMEX>, who is brain-dead and on a life support system in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jordan</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York</ENAMEX>
Times and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> go with impeachment analyses--the WP
assesses the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX>' intensifying press for censure, while the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">replays Witness Week</ENAMEX> and finds no progress for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX>. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witnesses</ENAMEX>, concludes the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> , essentially stood by their grand jury
testimony and offered no dramatic or mind-changing revelations.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> story says that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sens.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dianne Feinstein</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Calif</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Robert</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bennett</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Utah</ENAMEX>) are lobbying both parties hard for a tough censure motion.
Among those expressing reservations is <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gordon Smith</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ore</ENAMEX>), who opined
that the censure language may be "harder to nail down than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jello</ENAMEX> to a barn
door." That's for sure--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Feinstein</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bennett</ENAMEX> are on draft number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> (and
counting) of the motion. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Feinstein</ENAMEX>, as a front-page <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> article
explains, is determined. She was among the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX> to openly condemn
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX>'s conduct and she has nudged the censure option along from
initial ostracism to near-popularity.

            The papers agree that the previews of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX> testimony--videotaped
portions of which will be played to an open <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX>--show the young
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> as a poised, ironical, occasionally even sassy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witness</ENAMEX> who handily
outmaneuvers her stumbling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">interrogators</ENAMEX>. ("Question: Do you think he's [the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX>'s] a very intelligent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>? Deft answer: I think he's an intelligent
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>.")

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> 's front-page spread on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hussein</ENAMEX> reports that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jordan</ENAMEX> is in deep
mourning already, with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> hovering in dread beside their television sets to
await official word. Reports are that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King's family</ENAMEX> will not remove his
life support system so his death could come in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hussein</ENAMEX> coverage
also dominates at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> . All the papers mull the
Jordanian succession--the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> warns of "deep anxiety, here [in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jordan</ENAMEX>]
and abroad, about the stability of the relatively small and defenseless
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">kingdom</ENAMEX>." A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> editorial offers an original angle: The general senility
of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> (average age <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 70</NUMEX>) means that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hussein</ENAMEX>'s death could
"herald the beginning of a traumatic changing of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guard</ENAMEX> across the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arab</ENAMEX>
world." Nonetheless, all papers draw relief from a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> interview by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prince</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abdullah</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hussein</ENAMEX>'s designated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">successor</ENAMEX>, in which the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prince</ENAMEX> vowed to
continue his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>'s policies toward <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jordan</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Middle East</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX>.

            A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> front-page item reports that the richest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> in the world (and
his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>) just donated <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$3.3 billion</NUMEX> to charity. The lucky and eponymous
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">beneficiaries</ENAMEX>: The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William H. Gates Foundation</ENAMEX>, which deals with world health
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> issues, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gates Learning Foundation</ENAMEX>. This megadose of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">philanthropy propels Gates</ENAMEX>--whose estimated worth at last stock count was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$80</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">billion</ENAMEX>--into the ranks of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Andrew Carnegie</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John D. Rockefeller</ENAMEX>--and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gates</ENAMEX>
is still alive to keep feeding his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">foundation</ENAMEX>.

            In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kosovo</ENAMEX>, more <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Yugoslav</ENAMEX> recalcitrance: All papers report inside that
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Yugoslav</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Slobodan Milosevic</ENAMEX> has thrown his first kink into peace
talks set to begin <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rambouillet</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yugoslavia</ENAMEX> has refused to
grant <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kosovo Liberation Army</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> the travel documents necessary to
return to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kosovo</ENAMEX> after the talks. As a result, the entire ethnic-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Albanian</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">delegation</ENAMEX> is grounded in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kosovo</ENAMEX> while Western <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> scurry around <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Belgrade</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cajoling Milosevic</ENAMEX> to back down.

            Dipping back to impeachment, here's a classic exchange between the "poised"
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monica</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Manager</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward Bryant</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bryant</ENAMEX>, attempting delicacy, alludes to
"the first so-called salacious occasion." Crestfallen, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX> stutters, "I
mean, this is--this is my relationship."
