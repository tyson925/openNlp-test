            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> ,
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Angeles Times</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> each lead with the initial brief filings in
the impeachment trial. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> flags the story in its front page news
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">box.</ENAMEX> The headlines at the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal</ENAMEX> stress the
offering by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> of his defense, while the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> big type
explains that the paperwork dumped on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> includes arguments from both
sides. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> runs its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinton</ENAMEX> defense story as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">off-</ENAMEX>lead and goes instead
with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Jordan</ENAMEX>'s imminent retirement, a story that rates big front play at
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> and a reefer at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> . Another sports story dominates
much of the rest of the USAT front: the wildly accelerating prices
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sports</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">franchises</ENAMEX> are fetching. For the price--<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$800 million</NUMEX>--that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Redskins</ENAMEX> brought over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the weekend</TIMEX>, you could, notes the paper, buy a
space <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">shuttle</ENAMEX> flight, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avis</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rolls-Royce</ENAMEX>.

            The upshot of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> filing is that the charges do not rise to the
level of "high crimes and misdemeanors," while the thrust of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX>' brief is that if <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s transgressions aren't
impeachable, then no <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> not a convicted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">felon</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">murderer</ENAMEX> need ever fear
impeachment in the future. It's noted all around that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> has added
a more aggressive wrinkle to its posture: now claiming that it's a "myth" that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> did not tell the grand jury the truth about his relationship with
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monica Lewinsky</ENAMEX>. Dissembling about that relationship was confined to the Paula
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jones</ENAMEX> trial deposition, which as it happens, is no longer an issue because the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">article</ENAMEX> of impeachment concerning it was not passed.

            Everybody notes that with the impeachment trial set to start <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> eschewed the usual joint press conference alongside visiting
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Argentine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carlos Menem</ENAMEX>. And both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> note
that the congressional wood <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop</ENAMEX> has been busy building new tables especially
for the trial. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> says its latest poll indicates <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">85 percent</NUMEX> of
those surveyed said they had definitely made up their minds about the case,
which, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> says, is "good news for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>."

            The coverage emphasizes that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> chose at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this time</TIMEX> not to file
motions challenging the proceedings, motions that could have added <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX> to the
whole process. But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX> also report that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> has indicated it
will probably file such motions if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> chooses to allow the calling of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witnesses</ENAMEX> after the initial presentations by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> defense <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counsel</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> notes that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> has also
dropped for now plans for any constitutional challenges such as that the
articles of impeachment were passed by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lame-duck</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX>. But, the paper adds,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Harkin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Wellstone</ENAMEX> have filed a procedural motion that
would open the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX>'s closed door for deliberations on trial motions or the
final verdict.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> reports that at a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> press conference, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry Flynt</ENAMEX>
accused <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Barr</ENAMEX>, one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> impeachment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX>, of hypocrisy for
refusing to answer questions put to him about a relationship with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> not
then his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> (she is now) during divorce proceedings.

            Inside pieces at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> report that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> national
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">security</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> including <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madeleine Albright</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>
have recommended that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> deny clemency to convicted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spy</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jonathan Pollard</ENAMEX>.
The official word is that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> hasn't come to a decision yet, though. The
stories don't mention whether or not <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albright</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> were influenced by or
mentioned to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Yorker</ENAMEX> story by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Seymour Hersh</ENAMEX>
arguing that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pollard</ENAMEX>'s intelligence take made its way to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Soviet Union</ENAMEX>.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> 's "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Reliable Source</ENAMEX>" reports that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Duke</ENAMEX> now has an
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponent</ENAMEX> in the race to fill <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Livingston</ENAMEX>'s soon-to-be-vacated congressional
seat: it's--and this is really her name--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monica Monica</ENAMEX>.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> op-ed page contains a rumination about the imminence of the
millennium by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alain de Botton</ENAMEX> that scans with the familiarity of an old shoe.
But wait <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a second</TIMEX>, it is an old shoe! The piece is merely a lift of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> pages
from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Botton</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two-year-old</TIMEX> book <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">How Proust Can Change Your Life with</ENAMEX>
a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX> tack-on. Talk about <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Remembrances of Things Past</ENAMEX>! Shouldn't the stuff in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX> be...new?
