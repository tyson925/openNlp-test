            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">All three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX> lead with the decision by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nations</ENAMEX> to extend the peace talks in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kosovo</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three more days</TIMEX>. The original
deadline was <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">noon</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Two days ago</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> promised not to
extend this deadline and re-iterated his intent to bomb the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Serbs</ENAMEX> (via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX>) if
the deadline passed without an agreement. He changed his mind on the advice of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albright</ENAMEX> and her fellow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">negotiators</ENAMEX>, who feel the talks are worth continuing.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>
Times' news story casts the decision as "an embarrassment" for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>
Times restrict themselves to observing that this is a policy
reversal.

            None of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX> seems to know just what convinced the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">negotiators</ENAMEX>
that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> more <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> of negotiation would be valuable. It's particularly
puzzling since <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albright</ENAMEX> is quoted as saying that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Serbs</ENAMEX> have taken "every
opportunity for evasion and delay," and nowhere does she explain why things
have changed.

            The main sticking point in the talks is that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Serbs</ENAMEX> don't want <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> to police the agreement in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kosovo</ENAMEX> while the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> says this is
non-negotiable. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> reports that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Serbs</ENAMEX> have suggested a civilian
enforcement <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> under the aegis of a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">pan-European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> interprets this to mean that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Serbs</ENAMEX> are willing to countenance "armed
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreigners</ENAMEX> on their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">territory</ENAMEX>," which might be a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step towards some sort
of agreement. But the same story quotes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albright</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minister</ENAMEX> as
saying that only a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> is acceptable. In fact, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minister</ENAMEX> is
quoted in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> as saying that "no one is predicting [the problems]
will be gone" by the new deadline <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three days</TIMEX> from now, adding that "there is no
guarantee of a happy story." A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> editorial on the subject warns against
the ultimate folly of appeasing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milosevic</ENAMEX>.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> gives front page coverage to the kickoff of a summit between
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prime ministers</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>. The summit--only the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> time an
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prime minister</ENAMEX> has visited <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>--is the culmination of several
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> of chumminess between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX>, who conducted what the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX>
calls "tit-for-tat tests of nuclear bombs" just <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 months ago</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indian Prime</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vaypayee</ENAMEX> arrived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> by bus, a journey which inaugurated
motorcoach service between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> (before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX>, one had to take
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX>). Vaypayee was greeted at the border by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pakistani</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prime</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sharif</ENAMEX>, and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> embraced for the cameras.

            A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT Magazine</ENAMEX> story proclaims the end of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX>'s slide into the
