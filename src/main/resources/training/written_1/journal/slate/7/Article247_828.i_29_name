            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York</ENAMEX>
Times leads with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX>'s biggest scoop. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State of</ENAMEX>
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Union</ENAMEX> address will introduce a carrot-and-stick funding program to improve
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">elementary</ENAMEX> and secondary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> leads with a scooplet--the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> will challenge some of the facts gathered by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth Starr</ENAMEX>.
The 
               <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>
Times
               , 
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>
Today
               , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> have no scoops at all, and
are left to report what the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senators</ENAMEX> said on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX>'s political talk shows.
(The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> informs that fully <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one-fifth</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX>--<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senators</ENAMEX>--appeared on the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> shows.)

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State of the Union</ENAMEX> article--which may of course prove to be
a trial balloon--says that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> wants to tie federal funds to whether
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> test their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX>. So-called "social promotions"--promoting
unqualified <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> from grade to grade so they stay with their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peers</ENAMEX>--will be
discouraged as well. Finally, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> and his speechwriters also intend to
discuss <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX>, unveil a plan to safeguard <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX>'s nukes, and beef up
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> defenses against biological weapons attacks. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>'s speech
(scheduled for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX>) will not directly address his legal troubles since he
hopes to shift <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX>' attentions away from the impeachment trial. Predictably,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> story is sourced to "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>" and "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aides</ENAMEX>" in the
first few paragraphs; oddly enough, it quotes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce Reed</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s chief
domestic policy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisor</ENAMEX>) by name at the end.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> reports that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> plan on a "fact-driven"
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">defense</ENAMEX>, which means challenging the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX> report's specific allegations rather
than arguing that none of the allegations warrant removal. All papers report
that most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senators</ENAMEX> expect <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witnesses</ENAMEX> to be called. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democratic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senators</ENAMEX> are
threatening to call <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth Starr</ENAMEX> as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witness</ENAMEX>.

            The international lead is that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Yugoslav</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX> is attacking the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kosovo</ENAMEX> where <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45</NUMEX> ethnic <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Albanians</ENAMEX> were executed on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX>. Needless to say, the
fighting and the massacre are signs of a breakdown in the cease-fire agreement
signed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four months ago</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX> has condemned <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milosevic</ENAMEX> but chooses not to bomb
him.

            On what would have been <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rev.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin Luther King</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">70th</NUMEX> birthday, most papers
run several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX>-related stories. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> presents a vignette of life on
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">D.C.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin Luther King Jr.</ENAMEX> Avenue ("<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Life</ENAMEX> and death, faith and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">despair</ENAMEX>, violence and a tenuous brand of peace coexist"). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> runs a
story on <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> as well as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Safire</ENAMEX> column recounting the time
he, a young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">press agent</ENAMEX>, organized a press conference for the then obscure
King. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roy Cohn</ENAMEX> warned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Safire</ENAMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> thought <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">King</ENAMEX> a "commie"; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morton</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Janklow</ENAMEX> advised <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Safire</ENAMEX> to ignore <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cohn</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shelby Steele</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WSJ</ENAMEX> argues
that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">King</ENAMEX>'s rhetorical prowess made <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX> ashamed about this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>'s racial
history, unwittingly encouraging liberal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX> to feel "responsible" for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX>, which prevents <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> from becoming truly free. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steele</ENAMEX> thinks King
should be revisited as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who "made freedom <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of all a black
responsibility."

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> reports on a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boulder</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colorado</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> that is designing a
"robokoneko" ("robot kitten" in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX>). Why a kitten? Because baby <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> are
"cute, media-friendly" says the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">robokoneko</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designer</ENAMEX>. Apparently the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">kitten</ENAMEX>'s
"brain" will actually build itself--<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">programmers</ENAMEX> write <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mini-</ENAMEX>programs that are
able to build new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mini-</ENAMEX>programs which will eventually fuse into a simulacrum of
a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">kitten</ENAMEX>'s thought process. The end-program will ultimately be strapped to a
working wire-and-steel kitten. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> warns that this robotic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> may
not "walk between your legs as you go down the stairs"--the article doesn't
actually specify how this robot will be <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>-like at all--but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> can rest
assured that the final product will be readily convertible into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) a
self-directed housecleaning robot or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2</NUMEX>) a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Mars rover</ENAMEX>. (No kidding.)
