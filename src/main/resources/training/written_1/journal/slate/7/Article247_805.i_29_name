            Each of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">majors</ENAMEX> goes its own way <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> for a lead. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> leads with the emerging consensus among
many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senators</ENAMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> trial might begin <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">just days</TIMEX> after the new
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> convenes and could proceed very swiftly. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX>
puts a similar story inside. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> flags this story in its front-page news
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">box</ENAMEX>, with its headline saying that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX>'s consensus "dashes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s
hopes" for making a deal and avoiding a trial. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>
Times goes with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX>'s news from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOJ</ENAMEX> that violent crime in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> has fallen to its lowest level in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least 24 years</TIMEX>. According to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> lead about the retail economy, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> knew just what to do about
a presidential impeachment and combat against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX>: go shopping. At many big
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">chains</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this month</TIMEX>'s sales will likely be, says the paper, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between 4 and 5</NUMEX>
percent higher than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last December</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA Today</ENAMEX> ,
which fronts the shopping story, uses its lead to detail a little-noticed
political trend shaping up for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>: pay raises for state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">legislators</ENAMEX>. State
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX>' salaries are going up, says the paper, in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least ten</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> approved <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">26 percent</NUMEX> raise to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s
lushest rate of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">almost $100,000</NUMEX>, and in <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> place, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>'s legislature
came up with a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">38 percent</NUMEX> raise to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$79,500</NUMEX>. But not all state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pols</ENAMEX> are in this
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stratosphere</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arizona</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60 percent</NUMEX> raise took it to a ceiling of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$24,000</NUMEX>, in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Connecticut</ENAMEX>, a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 percent</NUMEX> raise meant only getting to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$21,800</NUMEX>, and in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Idaho</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX>
percent meant just to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$14,760</NUMEX>. (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> problem: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAT</ENAMEX> doesn't say which if
any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">legislatures</ENAMEX> are only part-time jobs.)

            According to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senators</ENAMEX> went out of their way on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> chat
show appearances to appear less partisan and less combative than their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterparts</ENAMEX> had seemed when they had the impeachment ball in their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX>. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Orrin Hatch</ENAMEX> was reflecting the view of some of his
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> when, on "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Face the Nation</ENAMEX>," he expressed doubt that it would be
necessary to call any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witnesses</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> also quotes <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel Moynihan</ENAMEX> as
expressing the fear that at stake here is the possibility that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> could
"easily mutate into a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the month</TIMEX>...where a congressional majority
began routinely removing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">presidents</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> become <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>, no one knows
who is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commander</ENAMEX>-in-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX>...."

            Highlights from the DOJ crime stats just in, for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>, include, notes the
LAT : property crime dropped to its lowest rate since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1973</TIMEX>; the rate of
violent crime has dropped <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 21 percent</NUMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>; and there were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX>
percent fewer murders than in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>. The paper quotes <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s
explanation for the trend: more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> and stricter gun laws. The LAT
quotes an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">academic expert</ENAMEX> citing another: a decrease in the crack <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocaine</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trade</ENAMEX>, caused by the proliferation of legal economic opportunities for young
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> , in its inside piece on the crime drop, plays the crack downturn
explanation much higher, and notes that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> crimes that have fallen the
most sharply since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX>--homicide and robbery--are the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> most closely
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with crack. And the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> give a different primary
explanation for why the young have been avoiding crack of late: The clear
negative consequences for role <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> who got caught up in the stuff. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> runs an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX> story on the crime drop inside, and it doesn't mention the
role of crack.

            A WSJ front-page feature observes a new sign of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>'s struggling
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">economy</ENAMEX>: Its unemployment rate--<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.4 percent</NUMEX>--is now as high as <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">America's</ENAMEX>, for
the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time since <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX> started keeping such statistics <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45 years ago</TIMEX>. As of
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 67.5 percent</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> college <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">seniors</ENAMEX> had jobs lined up,
compared to a routine <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90 percent</NUMEX> just <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few years ago</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>'s long-vaunted job
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">security</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> may, says the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal</ENAMEX> actually be a big part of the
problem. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Companies</ENAMEX> averse to firing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> are, in a sluggish economy,
reluctant to hire too. By contrast, accustomed as they are to the prospects of
layoffs, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> are more open to moving around the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> and between
economic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sectors</ENAMEX> for a good job. Another factor, says the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal</ENAMEX> , is
the rise of temp <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> in this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>.

            Former <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> (and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carter</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counsel</ENAMEX> and official <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington</ENAMEX>
"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Wise Man</ENAMEX>" <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lloyd Cutler</ENAMEX>, who's not exactly known for pegging the old wacky
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">meter</ENAMEX>, cuts loose on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> op-ed page by envisioning what's next in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>: a legally required annual form to be filled out by all
elected and appointed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> in which they document all their sexual
activity for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the previous year</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cutler</ENAMEX>'s form has the usual bureaucratic
detail, such as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> different examples of the term "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relative</ENAMEX>." But
there's a serious omission when it comes to public <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">servants</ENAMEX> like his last
presidential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boss</ENAMEX>: it doesn't define "sexual activity."
