               My
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fiance</ENAMEX> and I attend different <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">universities</ENAMEX>. He is a scholarship <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">athlete</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">academics</ENAMEX> are not his forte. Lately, I have taken it upon myself to write a few
of his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX>. Now he has come to expect it. How can I tell him that I am not
his tutor or his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">slave</ENAMEX> without causing a fight? I don't mind doing the work, I
just know it's not the best thing for him.

            Dear Two
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Dips,</ENAMEX>

            You unfortunately have a
sticky wicket of your own making--and that may be the way out. Since it was
your idea initially, tell the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">athlete</ENAMEX> something like "I have made a
great mistake." Explain that you were not thinking ahead, imagined it to be a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">one-shot</ENAMEX>, and now know it is not beneficial for him in the long run. (No
need to go into the national scandal of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> going academically easy on
their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">athletes</ENAMEX> and graduating dumb <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>.)

            Prudie
foresees a potential fight, and then you will have to evaluate the young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>'s
values and intellect in relation to your own. As one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudie</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> says,
mazel ton ... tons of luck.

            --<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudie</ENAMEX>, studiously

            
               
                  Dear
Prudie,
               
            

            
               I need advice. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> of
my acquaintance recently announced that she has a "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boyfriend</ENAMEX>" and wants
everyone to introduce the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fellow</ENAMEX> by that title. It seems to me that when you've
reached the stage of life where your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> are eligible for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AARP</ENAMEX>, all your
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandchildren</ENAMEX> are married, and some of your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">great-grandchildren</ENAMEX> have their own
Web sites, you should find a term other than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boyfriend</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> with whom
you're hooking up, hanging out, going steady, or whatever.
            

            
               At
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">social</ENAMEX> occasions such as my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX>'s upcoming bar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mitzvah</ENAMEX>, I would be reluctant to
say, "I'd like you to meet my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandmother</ENAMEX> and her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boyfriend</ENAMEX>." It just sounds
wrong. Can you suggest an alternative term?
            

            
               --<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neologistically Needy</ENAMEX>
in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Jersey</ENAMEX>
            

            Dear
Neo,

            Personally, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudie</ENAMEX> is not
wild about "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boyfriend</ENAMEX>" and "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girlfriend</ENAMEX>" for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>, and she
loathes the term "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lover</ENAMEX>" except when used by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>.

            Prudie may be a tad retro,
but the terms "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">beau</ENAMEX>," "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady friend</ENAMEX>," or "beloved" seem about right for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">grown-ups</ENAMEX>. Then, of course, you could always use the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chap</ENAMEX>'s name: "This is my
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">grandmother</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schwartz</ENAMEX>."

            Would you
feel very unhappy with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudie</ENAMEX> if she mentioned that a married <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>'s
grandmother referring to her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boyfriend</ENAMEX> is rather sweet, considering
everyone's ages?

                  Dear
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudence</ENAMEX>,
               
            

            
               I am
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">overly</ENAMEX> stressed by finals, and the question haunts me: When will the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">insanity</ENAMEX>
stop? <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Teachers</ENAMEX> are asking more of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every year</TIMEX>, and it's coming to the
point where the average <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX> has to go to college for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four years</TIMEX> just to flip
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">burgers</ENAMEX>. I am asking you: Why is everything so hard now--more so than 25 years
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ago</TIMEX>?
            

            
               --<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pete Fiala</ENAMEX>
            

            Dear
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pete</ENAMEX>,

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudie</ENAMEX> isn't sure how to
square your complaints with all the news stories about grade inflation and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">college</ENAMEX>-level courses such as "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Structure</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Soap Opera</ENAMEX>" and "The
History of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beads</ENAMEX>."

            It is
possible you are not in a college suited to your needs. If it's any comfort,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudie</ENAMEX> cannot imagine how she got through her own university <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> and
sympathizes about the increasing need for degrees just to get a foot in any
door.

            --<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudie</ENAMEX>,
empathetically

            
               
                  Dear
Prudie,
               
            

            
               You counseled Holding a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Secret</ENAMEX>
in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toronto</ENAMEX> that she had a civic duty to report her old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boyfriend</ENAMEX> for tax
fraud. I can't say about <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadians</ENAMEX>, but we in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> have no such
duty.
            

            
               A small informal poll
indicated that we would voluntarily yield <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14 percent</NUMEX> of our income to
government. Anything beyond that is not voluntary. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reader's Digest</ENAMEX>
poll indicates that the most anyone (at least anyone in a family of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>)
should have to pay is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25 percent</NUMEX>.
            

            
               I believe the current
level of taxation is illegitimate because it is done without the consent of the
governed. Prudie, even if you personally don't agree that we are at the point
where noncooperation is a virtue, won't you admit that at some level of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">taxation</ENAMEX>, "noncooperation" with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal Revenue Service</ENAMEX> would become a
civic duty?
            

            
               During the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Vietnam War</ENAMEX>,
some conscientious objectors believed they were acting for the good of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> and did so at great personal risk. Perhaps tax resisters should be
viewed with the same mix of emotions that we viewed conscientious
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">objectors</ENAMEX>?
            

            
               Prudie,
can I get you to withdraw your blanket statement that we have a civic duty to
report tax <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">evaders</ENAMEX>?
            

            
               --<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Clack</ENAMEX>
            

            Dear
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles</ENAMEX>,

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudie</ENAMEX>'s reply to her <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toronto</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">correspondent</ENAMEX> did not say that tax <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">evaders</ENAMEX> must always be reported, but she
wonders why you wish the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reader's Digest</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX> made up <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>.
While no one really likes forking over taxes, that money pays for a
multitude of government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">services</ENAMEX> and functions. Which ones should be
eliminated? (Whatever their true merits, widely unpopular items such as foreign
aid make up only a tiny percentage of the federal budget.)

            Taxes are,
of course, a complicated issue. What is proper, and what is enough? The concept
of a fiscal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizen</ENAMEX>'s arrest (tattling on tax fraud) is subject to many
considerations. What you call "noncooperation" with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> is called "tax
evasion" by the feds and is punishable by jail time. Just as those who
protested the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Vietnam War</ENAMEX> paid various prices, it would seem logical that tax
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">protesters</ENAMEX> make a similar determination. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gandhi</ENAMEX> would be the perfect <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> to
consult about civil disobedience as it pertains to taxes but, alas, it is
impossible to contact him.
