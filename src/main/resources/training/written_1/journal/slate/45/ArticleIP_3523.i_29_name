            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harry Smith</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1923-1991</TIMEX>) was
a self-created character, deserving of a novel no one has yet written. Small,
gnomelike, with an acerbic, high-pitched voice, he was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tramp scholar</ENAMEX> who, in
a peripatetic life on the fringes, became a recognized <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authority</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Seminole</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fabrics</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Ukrainian Easter</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX>, and the ubiquity of string figures in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">world</ENAMEX>'s cultures. He was a record <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">producer</ENAMEX>, an adept of black magic, and an
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">avant-garde filmmaker</ENAMEX> who pioneered, among other things, the kind of collage
animation later made famous by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monty Python</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Terry Gilliam</ENAMEX>. He began
collecting <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">78</NUMEX>-rpm recordings in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1940s</TIMEX>, acquiring <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of "race"
and "hillbilly" works from the junk <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific Northwest</ENAMEX> before they
could be melted down, their shellac recuperated for the war effort.

            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1952</TIMEX> he assembled <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">84</NUMEX> of
these songs in an anthology that was at once systematic and intuitive. In <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three</TIMEX>
volumes-- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ballads</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Music</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Songs</ENAMEX> --he gathered
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">blues</ENAMEX>, gospel hymns, murder narratives, reels and jigs, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cajun</ENAMEX> tunes, sermons,
and ancient Child ballads transmuted from their <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> origins by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX> in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">mountains</ENAMEX> and valleys of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>. He laid down a few ground rules: The
material had to have been recorded commercially, "<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1927</TIMEX>, when electronic
recording made possible accurate music reproduction, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1932</TIMEX> when the
Depression halted folk music sales"; otherwise, he was guided only by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">serendipity</ENAMEX> and his own ears. Yet he succeeded in making a collection that was
definitive in its selections and mysteriously cohesive, the diverse offerings
falling together like strands of a single design. You have to remember that, at
the time, no one had an overview on this stuff. Few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> knew any of it,
besides some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">old-timers</ENAMEX> and a scattering of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enthusiasts</ENAMEX>; "folk music" meant
either the topical work of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Woody Guthrie</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leadbelly</ENAMEX> or the kind of art-song
taxidermy practiced by the likes of the baritone <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Jacob Niles</ENAMEX>.

            Slowly
and invisibly, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Anthology</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">captivated</ENAMEX> and influenced a generation. It
was the ur-text for the folk music boom of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1960s</TIMEX>. It was plundered by
everybody, especially <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Dylan</ENAMEX>, who swiped, alluded, and rewrote, so much in
the spirit of the original works, among which lines and verses migrate freely,
that he forcefully inserted himself into the tradition. After that, though, the
collection's fame returned underground. Few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> born after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1950</TIMEX> had heard of
it, despite its remaining in print until <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Folkways Records</ENAMEX> dissolved when its
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owner</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moe Asch</ENAMEX>, died in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-1980s</TIMEX>.

            It has finally been reissued, in a lavish package (full
disclosure: I contributed a small reminiscence of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">liner</ENAMEX> notes).
This took some doing, because the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anthology</ENAMEX> was in effect a bootleg--the
original recordings had been imperfectly documented if at all, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> were
paid small flat fees and sent in most cases back to obscurity, but the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">copyrights</ENAMEX> had accrued to large publishing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">consortiums</ENAMEX>. The packaging, while
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">splendid</ENAMEX> (and including helpful and sometimes inspiring essays, complete
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">documentation</ENAMEX>, and an enhanced CD containing films and recordings of and by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX>), is maybe too lavish by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>, since its price tag will put it far beyond
the means of young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. It is to be hoped that its volumes will be issued
individually.

            
Nevertheless, it is available again, and its importance cannot be overstated.
Reviewing it in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Piazza</ENAMEX> was reminded of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edmund</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX>'s The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Shock</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Recognition</ENAMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce Shapiro</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Nation</ENAMEX>
compared it to the reprinting of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moby Dick</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1920s</TIMEX>. Such assertions
might make you suspicious, but they are not hyperbole. Consider that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX>, who
said he searched for records that sounded "odd" or "exotic," managed to include
an array of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">composers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">performers</ENAMEX> who, rather than being typical or
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX>--the goal of most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">makers</ENAMEX> of field recordings--were singular
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX>. Some were truly weird, others major <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">innovators</ENAMEX> whose stature would
only be recognized later: <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Blues radical Charley Patton</ENAMEX> was forgotten; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dock</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boggs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Hutchinson</ENAMEX> have barely been given their due even now. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Click</ENAMEX> to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hear Boggs</ENAMEX>' menacing combination of blues and high-lonesome mountain styling.)
Consider also that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smith</ENAMEX> deliberately avoided identifying the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">performers</ENAMEX> by
race--"It took <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> before anybody discovered that Mississippi <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Hurt</ENAMEX>
wasn't a hillbilly," he said, and it is just as surprising to find out that
such bluesmen as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hutchinson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard "Rabbit" Brown</ENAMEX> were white.

            
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anthology</ENAMEX> is a picture of what
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">indigenous American</ENAMEX> music was like before the age of mass <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX>, at a time when
songs and ideas could only be transmitted by live performance and by rumor and
yet circulated far and fast, among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">musicians</ENAMEX> isolated by race or poverty or
lost in rural <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">backwaters</ENAMEX>. The migratory quality of lyrics--the fact that lines
and whole verses traveled from this song to that one, from blues to mountain
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ballad</ENAMEX> or vice versa, regardless of origin or even sense--made for a sort of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">native Surrealism</ENAMEX>, a collage by accretion. It also shows how profoundly linked
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">black</ENAMEX> and white cultures were; <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglo</ENAMEX> traditions twined around and
through each other like closely planted <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>. Tradition, for that matter,
coexisted with experimentation, so that it is not always immediately obvious
which is which--you might not realize from listening that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blind Lemon Jefferson</ENAMEX>
was an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">innovator</ENAMEX> who transformed the blues and influenced every subsequent
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX> in the genre, or that the shape-note singing of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sacred Harp</ENAMEX> choirs
represents a late vestige of a style that may have reached its acme of
prevalence around the time of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">American Revolution</ENAMEX>. All of it, in any case,
sounds new and fresh and enduringly strange.

            There is history here, of
all sorts: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kelly Harrell</ENAMEX> impersonating <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Guiteau</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Garfield</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assassin</ENAMEX>; the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Carolina Tar Heels</ENAMEX> voicing the lament of shoemakers made
redundant by the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Industrial Revolution</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charlie Poole</ENAMEX> singing, "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roosevelt</ENAMEX> in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>, he's doing his best; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McKinley</ENAMEX> in the graveyard, he's taking
his rest." Other songs date back to the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16 th century</TIMEX>, or the
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">17 th</NUMEX> or the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">18 th</NUMEX> . Then <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Patton</ENAMEX>, appearing here under his
record-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>-imposed pseudonym, "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">the Masked Marvel</ENAMEX>," cuts loose with
"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Mississippi Boweavil Blues</ENAMEX>," a number as new and startling and disruptive
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> as it was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> he wrote it; dispensing with verse-chorus, he barks and
then punctuates with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> klaxon notes--rock 'n' roll!

            There are compelling
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">grotesqueries</ENAMEX>--"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Fatal Flower Garden</ENAMEX>," by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nelstone's Hawaiians</ENAMEX>--and items of
ineffable grandeur, such as the hymn "," <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">by the Alabama Sacred Harp Singers</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blind Willie Johnson</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> sing about the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Book of the Seven</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Seals</ENAMEX> , but not so great a distance separates them from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rabbit Brown</ENAMEX>, who
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sings</ENAMEX>, "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Sometimes</ENAMEX> I think that you're too sweet to die, but other times I think
you ought to be buried alive." <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarence Ashley</ENAMEX> will build his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cabin</ENAMEX> up on the
mountain so he can see "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Willie</ENAMEX>" fly by, and warns that the railroad <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> will
drink up your blood like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Jackson</ENAMEX> lowers the cadaver of his old
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> on a silver chain as with every link he calls his name. Murder, deception,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">defiance</ENAMEX>, laughter, orgy, rapture, and arcadia are all represented; there isn't
a number that doesn't exude passion. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anthology of American</ENAMEX> Folk
Music , as pure and exalted and lowdown and variegated an article of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">native</ENAMEX> culture as you'll find anywhere, is no <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> piece; as well as being
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ancient</ENAMEX>, it is sensational, vivid, and wild.
