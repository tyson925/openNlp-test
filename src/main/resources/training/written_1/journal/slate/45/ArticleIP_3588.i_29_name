            The only thing most
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gardeners</ENAMEX> really want from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> is assurance that it won't be back. But
before we plunge headlong into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">spring</TIMEX>--starting more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seeds</ENAMEX> than we could ever
hope to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>, scarfing up little wonders at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">nurseries</ENAMEX> because we simply
must have them--let us stop to consider the lesson of restraint to be
learned from the garden in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">People</ENAMEX>
often assume that the winter garden, its <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> having died back, is devoid,
wanting--gardenless. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Each year</TIMEX>, the gardening press rallies to remedy this
misimpression but only makes things worse. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Solace</ENAMEX> is offered: story after story
on how to supply your garden with what is ubiquitously referred to as "winter
interest." This consists of a seductive array of close-up photos of dangling
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">berries</ENAMEX> and mottled, peeling bark designed to cure whatever ails your
garden.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> problem with the term <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> interest is that it
implies that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> is not very interesting. Another is the notion that we seek
something as mealy and undistinguished as interest, rather than beauty, which
is what we strive for come <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">spring</TIMEX>.

            In their
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">defense</ENAMEX>, these articles do make us aware of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">woody winter plants</ENAMEX> and of
the increasing diversity of cultivars available for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> gardening. Few
things bring me as much joy as the sight of my own swampy backyard, all
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">leafless</ENAMEX> and brittle and dotted throughout with bright orange-red winterberries
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clinging</ENAMEX> to their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branches</ENAMEX>. To see the monochromatic splendor of a wintry
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Vermont</ENAMEX> wood, populated only by <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stands</ENAMEX> of dusky-white birches and smooth,
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">silver</ENAMEX>-gray beeches rising from the snow, is, I firmly believe, to live. The
craze for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> interest, on the other hand, has really become a fetish for
anything that can be left poking out of the snow.

            
But the garden as a whole can be beautiful in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">winter</ENAMEX>, and it can teach us a lot about what makes a garden beautiful in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Winter</ENAMEX> is a perfect time to visit gardens--not your <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX>'s garden,
perhaps, or a garden known mainly for its flower borders, but public gardens,
historic private gardens, well-designed <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX>, and arboretums. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quieter</ENAMEX> and more
evocative than in the high <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX>, when teeming with camera-toting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX>,
they're more likely to reveal their secrets, their pasts, and their intentions.
Undistracted by <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> or too much color, you can see tones, lines, shapes,
and light--the garden's pure form.

            A garden
is created more through gestures than by any <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>. Structure, often
referred to as "bones," is created through architectural elements such as
evergreen <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">hedges</ENAMEX>, arrangements of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">shrubs</ENAMEX>, walls, terraces, and
flights of stairs. The placement of these things affects the spatial perception
of the ground, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sides</ENAMEX>, and the roof <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> of the garden. Once you have
created such a garden "<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>," you can furnish it with any seasonal delights you
like. The bones of the garden are not put in place merely to console you when
you peer from the window in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX>; they are the garden.

            When I visited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chiswick House</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palladian villa</ENAMEX> outside
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this winter</TIMEX>, the garden beds in front of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">th century</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">conservatory</ENAMEX> were all empty--just brown <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dirt</ENAMEX> against green <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">grass</ENAMEX>. These beds,
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">made for the garish</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> displays of bright annuals popular in Victorian
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">England</ENAMEX>, will shortly be filled with them again. But on the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January day</TIMEX> when I
visited, these beds revealed themselves as simple shapes, well-proportioned and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">well-placed</ENAMEX>, making highly pleasing abstract patterns across the ground. We
would do well to consider our own garden beds, no matter how small, not just as
holes where the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> go but as things in themselves. Careful placement of
our beds would ensure that they did not appear unsightly in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX>, and more
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">importantly</ENAMEX>, that they create a satisfying grounding for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> to
come.

            This part
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chiswick gardens</ENAMEX> was wrapped by a high <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wall</ENAMEX> and punctuated with urns. A
flower bed or border is almost always more attractive with a backdrop or
enclosure, such as a hedge or <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">fence</ENAMEX>, to set it off. Even when empty, an
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enclosure</ENAMEX> immediately creates a garden.

            
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the most perfect garden <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> in our
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, and perhaps the most simple, is at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bloedel Reserve</ENAMEX>, formerly a
private estate, on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bainbridge Island</ENAMEX> near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Seattle</ENAMEX>. It consists of a
<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10-foot-high</NUMEX> clipped evergreen <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">hedge</ENAMEX> bordering a large rectangular <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">lawn</ENAMEX>.
Another large rectangle, a reflecting pool, is set into the lawn, level with
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">grass</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">Pool</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">grass</ENAMEX>, and hedge form a rectangle in a rectangle in a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rectangle</ENAMEX>. If you walk in through the surrounding woods, this overtly man-made
environment will appear to you as a scene of sublime calmness. The woods are
brought into the garden through their reflection on the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>. You're forced to
see the wild more clearly; you are made more aware of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> than when you
were walking under them. The simple gesture, strongly articulated, is more
powerful than any number of smaller ones. Come <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX>, this garden will hardly
look different from what it does now--a beautiful garden all of green, without
<ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>.
