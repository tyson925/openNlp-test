               (Note: This is the
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> in an occasional series assessing the narrative logic of movies.)
            

            We have recently crossed an
important cultural divide: Movies now make less sense than rock lyrics. Once it
seemed that the nonsensical blather of a song like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>'s "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Horse With No</ENAMEX>
Name" (with the immortal lines "The heat was hot" and "In the desert/ You can't
remember your name/ 'Cause there ain't no one/ For to give you no pain") could
never be challenged by any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">rival</ENAMEX> in any other art form. But that was before
they released <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Saint</ENAMEX> . This unfathomable spy movie is about a master
of disguise who dresses up as, among other things, a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poet</ENAMEX> and an
academic doofus to trick the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heroine</ENAMEX>--a lonely but gorgeous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicist</ENAMEX> with
<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart disease</ENAMEX>--into surrendering the cold-fusion formula she carries in her
bra. And that's the part that makes sense.

            How do
movies like this happen? It's hard to say. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint</ENAMEX> may be one of those
rare cases in which the inanity is deliberate. The fact that nothing in
this movie bears any relation to the basic cause-and-effect propositions of
earthly life suggests a conscious stupidity on the part of the filmmakers that
may, in fact, be a guiding aesthetic.

            With the average film, though, nothing of the sort is
intended. Those of us who write screenplays for a living are always perplexed
at what leaky logic vessels most movies turn out to be, given the endless
development process that takes place before production begins. In draft after
draft, in script meeting after script meeting, every narrative line is examined
for signs of warp, every motivation of every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> is finely adjusted,
until the story is as watertight as a birch-bark canoe.

            But when a movie nears
production, that canoe is suddenly launched into <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Niagara Falls</ENAMEX>. The dawdling
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">precision</ENAMEX> of development gives way to velocity and chaos. Perhaps a big star
comes aboard, declares the script a disaster for reasons of his own, and
convinces the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">studio</ENAMEX> to hire another writer--or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">five or six</NUMEX>--so that the final
shooting script is nothing but a pastiche of scenes from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a dozen</NUMEX> different
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">drafts</ENAMEX>. Perhaps a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> has a "vision" of a big boat slamming into something
(a feature, by the way, of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least four</NUMEX> recent films) and uses up so much of
the budget to bring it to reality that key scenes explaining who was on the
boat and why it was out of control are never shot. Or perhaps the scenes are
shot and never used because the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> cut of the movie is an hour too long.

            Then, of
course, there's the simpler observation that some movies are just badly
imagined and badly written, and nobody cares enough to do anything about
it.

            
In any case, this movie season is turning out
to be a festival of incoherence. It has brought us not only The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint</ENAMEX>
but also the brain-dead <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">epics</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anaconda</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Volcano</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Fifth</ENAMEX>
Element . Measured against this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven Spielberg</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Lost</ENAMEX>
World seems at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> glance to be a seamless web of logic. Nowhere in
The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Lost World</ENAMEX> 's bestiary is there a creature that behaves with the
motivational abandon of that snake in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Anaconda</ENAMEX> : striking minor
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> with accuracy and blinding velocity in one scene, hovering and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hissing</ENAMEX> and generally dithering around in the next, so that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heroine</ENAMEX> has
plenty of time to escape. When you see this snake swallow <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jon Voight</ENAMEX> and then
regurgitate him in front of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jennifer Lopez</ENAMEX> like a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> presenting a dead <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bird</ENAMEX>,
when you see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Voight</ENAMEX> give a little ironic wink before collapsing to the floor
and dying in a puddle of digestive slime, you are witnessing one of those
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">classic I</ENAMEX>-Don't-Think-So <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">moments</TIMEX> that help define the contemporary moviegoing
experience.

            The
I-Do<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">n't-Think-Sos in The Lost World</ENAMEX> are not lovingly premeditated, as
they appear to be in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Saint</ENAMEX> . They're the products of sloppy thinking.
Here is a movie that has no trouble making us believe its presiding
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">whopper</ENAMEX>--<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">reconstituted dinosaurs</ENAMEX>--but then continually breaches the credibility
contract on relatively minor reality issues like torque, animal behavior, and
maritime shipping.

            What are the odds that an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> who has been cut
from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school gym team</ENAMEX> would, upon finding herself besieged by velociraptors
in an abandoned <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dinosaur</ENAMEX>-breeding <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX>, happen to be standing under a pair
of handy parallel bars? Is it likely that she could, by twirling around and
around on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX>, generate enough power to kick the pouncing velociraptor
(weighing in at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> pounds, easy) through the air and out the window?

            Here comes a tyrannosaurus
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rex</ENAMEX>, charging down a stream bed after a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mob</ENAMEX> of panicky <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>. It growls and
snaps at the air, and though it does manage to stomp one <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victim</ENAMEX> (who, in a nice
touch, sticks to the bottom of its foot like a piece of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gum</ENAMEX>), in general it
moves with such a lumbering gait that we might as well be back in the '60s
watching <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valley of the Gwangi</ENAMEX> . Where is the lethal swiftness of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">predator</ENAMEX>? If a crocodile can outrun a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">human being</ENAMEX>, why can't a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Rex</ENAMEX>?

            OK, so
then they sedate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dinosaur</ENAMEX> and put it on a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ship</ENAMEX> and send it to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego</ENAMEX>. In
midocean, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-Rex</ENAMEX> wakes up and somehow breaks out of its heavily secured
cargo hold, eats everybody on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX>, then cleverly scurries back into hiding.
So much for the cruel stereotype of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">pea</ENAMEX>-brained <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dinosaur</ENAMEX>.

            
The biggest logic bloopers in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Lost</ENAMEX>
World arise from the conventionality at the heart of the movie. Neither
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spielberg</ENAMEX>, nor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">screenwriter</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Koepp</ENAMEX>, nor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Crichton</ENAMEX>, on whose novel
the movie is based, have shown any interest in challenging the moralistic
assumption at the heart of almost every <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">creature</ENAMEX> feature: That good intentions,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">spunkiness</ENAMEX> and, above all, good looks are the safeguards against rampaging
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">monsters</ENAMEX>. In movies like <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Lost World</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dinosaurs</ENAMEX> are not just
predators but avengers, nibbling a prissy little rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> here, chomping an
environmentally insensitive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">CEO</ENAMEX> there. The bill of fare is numbingly standard.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Villains</ENAMEX> are picked off in order of ascending nastiness--sadistic brutes,
followed by smarmy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">flacks</ENAMEX>, followed by twisted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visionaries</ENAMEX> in expensive suits.
Among the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heroes</ENAMEX>, we don't have to worry about the principled male <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientist</ENAMEX>,
the dynamic female <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal behaviorist</ENAMEX>, or the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stowaway children</ENAMEX>. But even among
the good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX>, a marginal physiognomy or a receding hairline can spell doom.
Keep your eye on that sad-faced electronics <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">specialist</ENAMEX>. He's bald, and he's
gonna pay.
