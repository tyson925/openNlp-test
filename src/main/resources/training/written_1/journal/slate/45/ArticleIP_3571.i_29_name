                  Dear
Prudie,
               
            

            
               As just an ordinary
citizen I could never have believed that I would become embroiled in the
presidential scandal. Not publicly, of course, but among my circle of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>.
            

            
               Although I am not a
wagering sort, I foolishly made a bet with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> before the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>'s
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> apology. I insisted that he would not come forth with a public mea
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">culpa</ENAMEX> . My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> insisted that he would. After some heated discussion we
agreed to place a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$5 wager</NUMEX> on the whole sordid mess, thus adding <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> more
dollars to the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$40 million</NUMEX> cost.
            

            
               Now that the president
has spoken, I am in a terrible quandary. I am a law-abiding, honorable, decent
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">citizen</ENAMEX>, and I stand by my responsibilities and my debts. But the question is:
What is my debt? Was that speech a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mea culpa</ENAMEX> ? I say, "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">No.</ENAMEX>" My friend
says, "Yes." I have thought of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Solomonic</ENAMEX> approach in which I would send <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2.50</NUMEX>
to my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> and he would send <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2.50</NUMEX> to me, but I am also a principled <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>,
and it is my view that this was no mea culpa --and I am backed by many
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commentators</ENAMEX>, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike Kelly</ENAMEX>, who said in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> , "This
speech wasn't a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mea culpa</ENAMEX> . It was an everybody-else
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">culpa</ENAMEX> ."
            

            
               I do not want to seem
cheap, but if one parsed that speech, perhaps one might settle on it being
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-twentieth of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mea culpa</ENAMEX> . I would then owe my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">25 cents</NUMEX>. Is
there any way at all that you can help me do the right, honorable, and
principled thing here?
            

            
               You be
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX>.

Tails
            

            Dear
Heads,

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudie</ENAMEX> is not a betting
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">parlor</ENAMEX>, but she sympathizes with you, having had her own doubts about that
speech. Since there is disputation about what exactly got said, and your bet
was with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudie</ENAMEX> suggests the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of you go out to lunch--<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX>--and
devote some of the luncheon conversation to the sad and shabby affair.

            You are
right that there was no obvious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">winner</ENAMEX> in your wager--not you, your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX>, or
even, alas, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>. And by the by, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudie</ENAMEX> could not help thinking that
had Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> waited <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX> to give that speech, it might have been quite
different.

            --<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudie</ENAMEX>,
compromisingly

            
               
                  Dear
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudence</ENAMEX>,
               
            

            
               I have a loving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX>
(beautiful, intelligent, but not always self-assured). She has been living with
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">musician</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nine years</TIMEX>. She is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">schoolteacher</ENAMEX>, and working on her
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">master's</ENAMEX>. He is a popular trumpet player with his own <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX>.
            

            
               Here is
my question. I'm worried about my lovely <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX>'s future, though that's her
business. I keep my mouth shut. But when it comes to occasions such as his
birthday or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX>, am I supposed to just send a card, or do I treat him
like my other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sons</ENAMEX> and send a gift?
            

            
               --<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arizona</ENAMEX>
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dear G.</ENAMEX>,

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goodness</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nine years</TIMEX> is
longer than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudie</ENAMEX>'s marriage to her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">starter husband</ENAMEX>, so the young people
certainly sound committed to each another. The problem, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudie</ENAMEX> divines, is not
that you don't care for the young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> but that you wish the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> were
married. Try to put your parental concern aside, since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1</TIMEX>) you don't get a vote
and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) marriage isn't for everyone.

            Since the
young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> with a horn is your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spouse</ENAMEX> equivalent, by all means treat
him as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX>, or a proper <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">in-law</ENAMEX>. Who knows? The family feeling may have a
positive effect.

            --<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudie</ENAMEX>, hopefully

            
               
                  Dear
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudence</ENAMEX>,
               
            

            
               I need some ideas. I'm a
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>, and I just moved to a new <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> and a new job. I'm having
difficulty meeting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. One might wonder how that's possible, given the
plethora of meeting places most big <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> offer my age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, but my troubles
are twofold. First, I don't drink (don't like the taste or the
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">fuzzy-headedness</ENAMEX>), and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>, I can't stand loud music. (I don't mind other
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> drinking, though--it's not a moral thing.) And I tend to cough when
confronted with cigarette smoke.
            

            

               Anyway, I've tried <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bookstores</ENAMEX> without any luck, and the average <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patron</ENAMEX>'s age
at the local dance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">studio</ENAMEX> is about twice mine. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Churches</ENAMEX> and the like are out,
too, since my atheism probably wouldn't go over too well at such functions. Do
you have any ideas for me? Do I have to start drinking, believing, and packing
Advil for the music headaches?
            

            
               --<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clueless</ENAMEX> in the
Capital
            

            Dear
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Clue,</ENAMEX>

            Do not start hitting
the bottle, for starters. If the need arises to order a drink, try <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudie</ENAMEX>'s
favorite: <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cranberry juice</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">soda</ENAMEX>, in a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine glass</ENAMEX>. Also hang in there with
your boycott of deafness-inducing music. The only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> you would find there,
anyway, are those whose musical taste would clash with your own.

            You also
need not find religion, or feign it, to meet <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. Simply get out and about.
Try affinity <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">volunteer groups</ENAMEX> of interest to you, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">singles</ENAMEX>'
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">nights</TIMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">supermarket</ENAMEX>, etc. And don't neglect to put out the word to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">co-workers</ENAMEX> that you're available. A <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who is a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">teetotaler</ENAMEX> and appreciator of good music sounds very desirable for a young
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> of taste. And don't dismiss the fact that the numbers are in your favor:
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">D.C.</ENAMEX>, has more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>, for reasons unknown to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudie</ENAMEX>. Good
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">luck</ENAMEX>.

                  Dear
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudence</ENAMEX>,
               
            

            
               I keep
on wondering about the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>'s current situation. Why would anyone be
interested if the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> had an affair? I could not care less what he does
in his personal life. I know he has plunged himself in deep <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX> for
committing perjury--that does interest me--but why does everyone make such a
fuss about his affair with silly <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monica Lewinsky</ENAMEX> anyway? She is a grown-up,
they knew what they were doing, it was certainly not harassment. Please help me
clear up my thoughts.
            

            
               --<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Confused Mone From</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>
            

            Dear
Con,

            Well, as to why anyone would
be interested, perhaps it's an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> thing. For whatever reason, we are,
unlike <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Europeans</ENAMEX>--and apparently <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexicans</ENAMEX>--always interested in the sex lives
of the famous. Maybe this is none of our business, but that's probably why we
are interested.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prudie</ENAMEX> suspects the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX>
situation became wildly interesting for the following reasons: She was near the
age of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clintons</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX>; she was a low-level <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX>; she was not
looking for financial gain; she was, er, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rubenesque</ENAMEX>; and she was a source of
interest to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> for a relatively long time. And you are right. It
certainly was not harassment.

            Remember,
too, that one of this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>'s defining characteristics is his <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hot Springs</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>, the one that impels him to chase skirts. A fitting coat of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX> for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Jefferson Clinton</ENAMEX> might carry the legend veni, vidi, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice</ENAMEX> : I
came, I saw, I partied.

            --<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudie</ENAMEX>,
regretfully
