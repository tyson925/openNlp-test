                  Dear
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudence</ENAMEX>,
               
            

            
               As we all know, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">restaurants</ENAMEX> is frequently outrageously overpriced. The alternative is to bring
your own and expect to pay corkage. I have noted, however, that even corkage
charges are rising to an unacceptable level. Aside from this, the charge is
included in the bottom line bill. My question is: What might be considered an
appropriate tip on the total, given that the corkage charge is for service as
well?
            

            

               Appreciate your comments.

            Dear
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack</ENAMEX>,

            Some
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who dine out often and are wine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">drinkers</ENAMEX> tell <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudie</ENAMEX> that when feeling
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">expansive</ENAMEX>, they let the grand total determine the tip. (And sometimes the total
can be quite grand.) Other times, when overtaken by the enough is enough
gremlin, they compute the gratuity based on the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX>, adding a modest increment
to acknowledge that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> was served. As anyone who can read a wine list knows,
a bottle of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> can be tr√®s pricey, and the same effort is exerted
pouring from a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$14</NUMEX> bottle of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> as from one that costs <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$90</NUMEX>.

                  Dear
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudence</ENAMEX>,
               
            

            
               How
about all the showers at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these days</TIMEX>? My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> says they have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> or
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three each week</TIMEX> at his place of business (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> pregnant, just gave birth,
going to be engaged, married, found a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lover</ENAMEX>, etc.) and he has to chip in <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$10</NUMEX>
for every "celebration." If he were someone who was an assistant, with an
ailing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> to support, well, it would be impossible. Luckily, he is highly
placed, but I mean, how does one gracefully NOT contribute?

            Dear
Dum,

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudie</ENAMEX> is
in your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>'s corner. The institutionalized begging of which you speak is
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">annoying</ENAMEX> and also can make hash of a budget. Perhaps <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who work in group
settings where some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hand</ENAMEX> is always out can start a reverse trend: Limit
forced-march giving to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2</NUMEX>. If this is not feasible, then after the umpteenth
verbal invoice, the hit-upee can just say: "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sorry</ENAMEX>, I am tapped out. My office
present allowance is all gone." He or she may be called cheap, but they will
not be called on again.

                  Dear
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudence</ENAMEX>,
               
            

            
               I am a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Korean</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> in
your <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six years</TIMEX>. Forgive my bad <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> if it occurs. I have been
fortunate to start a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX> that is going well. I studied <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Korea</ENAMEX>,
so I manage with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX>. After being here <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX>, on a visit to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Korea</ENAMEX> a man
I knew, younger than me, pursued me with ardor and convinced me to marry him.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Koh</ENAMEX> stayed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Korea</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many months</TIMEX>. It was hard to ever get him on the
phone.
            

            
               He said that if I would
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">finance</ENAMEX> his martial arts <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">studio</ENAMEX>, he would move to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> to be with me. I did,
and he moved here with his <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> teen-age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, who are wilder than my <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>.
There was not too much married activity, if you can know what I mean. Then he
returned alone to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Korea</ENAMEX>, saying his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX> couldn't do as well here as there.
He left his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> with me, and he uses <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of my credit cards.
            

            
               I have
no idea about what he plans, but I have the awful feeling that he may have used
me for a green card and for a way to keep his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>. I am afraid
to tell him I want to divorce, because <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husbands</ENAMEX> are not easy to find. There is
a chance that he is better than I think. What do you think?

            Dear
AN,

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudie</ENAMEX> thinks your use of
the subjunctive--he "may" be using you--is a hybrid emotion of wishful thinking
and denial. Cancel that credit card and arrange to return his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> to him
as soon as possible. You do not need <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> wild <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teen-agers</ENAMEX> and a sponging
younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> in absentia just so you can say you are married.

            File for
divorce and let the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kohs</ENAMEX> fall where they may ... I mean the chips. This man
sees you as a financial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">underwriter</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX>-sitting service. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudie</ENAMEX> can think
of nothing worse.

                  Dear
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudence</ENAMEX>,
               
            

            
               I've read with interest
your comments (and others' responses) on the use and abuse of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Viagra</ENAMEX>. As a user
of the previous wonder <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> of the moment, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Prozac</ENAMEX>, I am uneasy. I suppose my
unease is based on how quickly public discourse has switched from the medical
benefits of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Viagra</ENAMEX> to stories of otherwise healthy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> going to incredible
lengths to get something they don't medically need. It allows Those of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Us Who</ENAMEX>
Would <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Never Do Such a Thing</ENAMEX> to wring our hands and complain while feeling
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">superior</ENAMEX>--conveniently ignoring actual discussion about messy subjects such as
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">impotence</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">depression</ENAMEX> and our society's feelings toward these conditions and
those who have them.
            

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Viagra</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Prozac</ENAMEX> could
have been used as a starting point to discuss why impotence and depression are
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">underdiagnosed</ENAMEX> and undertreated. Instead, with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Prozac</ENAMEX>, we got stories about the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">specter</ENAMEX> of perpetually peppy sales <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reps</ENAMEX> and (erroneous) reports that it causes
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to go on murderous rampages--almost as titillating as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Viagra abusers</ENAMEX>'
perpetual erections. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ten years</TIMEX> after the introduction of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Prozac</ENAMEX>, depression
still labors under public misconceptions about its prevalence and
treatment.
            

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Viagra</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Prozac</ENAMEX> are used to treat real medical conditions. The abuse potential is a
worthy subject for public discourse but does nothing for the individual
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sufferer</ENAMEX> who would benefit from taking the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>.

            Prudie
hopes the public prints are not becoming All <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Viagra</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">All The Time</ENAMEX>, but with
that said, let her thank you for a heartfelt and thoughtful letter from someone
for whom <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medication</ENAMEX> has proved a boon.
