                  Dear
Prudie,
               
            

            
               Does working at
Slate allow you to be critical of parent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>?
            

            
               Journalistically, your
answer almost has to be "yes," but I've noticed an underlying love for all
things rendered unto <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gates</ENAMEX>. What is your opinion of the antitrust suit?
            

            
               If you're pro-MS you're a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sell</ENAMEX> out, and if you're anti-MS you'll prove us skeptics wrong.
            

            
               Don't
you hate how that forced decision-making works? <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Kinda</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Windows</ENAMEX>.
            

            
               --Monopolistically
yours,Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Free Parking</ENAMEX>
            

            Dear
Mr.,

            Of course
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudie</ENAMEX> is allowed to be critical of the parent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>--should she ever find
something of which to be critical. As for the antitrust matter, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudie</ENAMEX> is
always in favor of trust.

            --<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudie</ENAMEX>, Microsoftly

            
               
                  Dear
Prudie,
               
            

            
               I have started dating a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">guy</ENAMEX> with wonderful qualities and think he has real possibilities for the long
haul. There is only one glitch. (Isn't there always?)
            

            
               He is almost
pathologically cheap when it comes to eating out. To make this less of an
issue, I have taken to cooking dinner for us at my place or drumming up
"occasions" for dinner to be my treat.
            

            
               I am starting to wonder,
however, about his choice of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> leaning heavily to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pizzerias</ENAMEX> and
joints specializing in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">burgers</ENAMEX>. What do you think of all this?
            

            
               We are
both in our <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-20s</TIMEX> and have good jobs.
            

            
               --<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">No Four-Star</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Florence</ENAMEX>
            

            Dear No
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX>,

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudie</ENAMEX> knows the type. You've
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">allied</ENAMEX> yourself with the kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who will always opt for the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Road Kill</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cafe</ENAMEX>.

            There are many ways to
approach this. You can try to get to the bottom of his aversion to better
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">restaurants</ENAMEX>. (Perhaps he was traumatized at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Le Cirque</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>?) You can laugh it
off if he is in all other ways wonderful. You can let him know you would love a
slight modification of this particular behavior.

            But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bear</ENAMEX> in mind that women
are not reform <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>. There is an old saying, "A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> hooks up with a man
expecting he will change, but he doesn't. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> hooks up with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> expecting
she won't change, and she does."

            Prudie
thinks, overall, that if this is the young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lad</ENAMEX>'s only negative, you should
learn to roll with the punches (or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">burgers</ENAMEX>, in your case) and hope that his
maturing will ameliorate your problem.

                  Dear
Prudie,
               
            

            
               Now
that I am moving in with my significant other, I don't know what to do with the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mementos</ENAMEX> (mostly notes) of a torrid affair I had after the current significant
other and I became involved but before we were very serious. I don't want her
to find about the affair. I also don't want to get rid of the notes yet. What
to do?
            

            
               --<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anywhere</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Europe</ENAMEX>
            

            Dear
Any,

            Prudie
thinks you are wise not to stash the mash notes in your <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sock drawer</ENAMEX>. Discovery
would not be healthy for your current relationship. Since you don't wish to
discard the sizzlers, you have the option of storing them in a safety deposit
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">box.</ENAMEX> If there is a large quantity of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">billets-doux</ENAMEX>, then a storage bin at an
appropriate facility would do. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> is also an option, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudie</ENAMEX> thinks
not a great one ... too much room for errors of different kinds. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudie</ENAMEX> once
housed the jewelry of a divorcing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> and was very uncomfortable.

            --<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudie</ENAMEX>, secretively

            

               
                  Prudie,
               
            

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harking</ENAMEX> back to your
letter from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> insisted on writing notes rather than talking,
you wrote, "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dear I</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudie</ENAMEX> will pass up the chance to point out what would be
seen by some as your good fortune. A more common question might surely be 'How
can I get her to stop talking?' "
            

            
               Oh,
dear. While claiming to "pass up the chance," you take it. Is that
polite?
            

            
               --<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike</ENAMEX>,
inquiringly
            

            Dear
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike</ENAMEX>,

            Prudie
does not think the quote you mention is polite or impolite, but simply a
journalistic conceit to state the obvious. Actually, it was a quip pro quo--a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">retort Prudie</ENAMEX> could not resist. (And she definitely didn't mean to sound like a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traitor</ENAMEX> to her gender.)

            --<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudie</ENAMEX>, politely
