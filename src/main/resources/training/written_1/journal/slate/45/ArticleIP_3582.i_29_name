               Solution
to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Puzzle No. 6</ENAMEX>: "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">From Hang Gliding to Hoary Marmots</ENAMEX>"
            

            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last week</TIMEX>,
we challenged you to get from this page on hang gliding to this page featuring hoary marmots in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">six</TIMEX>
links or less. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">winners</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tamara Glenny</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert D. Mare</ENAMEX>, who made the trip
in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> links. Here's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Glenny</ENAMEX>'s solution:

            This was a very hard one,
I went down endless dead ends before hitting the right link, although I suppose
"<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest</ENAMEX>" should have given me a clue.

            At the hang gliding site, click
Links ...

            to go to <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ushga</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">org/links.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">htm</ENAMEX>, and from that list, choose
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest Voyaguers</ENAMEX> (spelled wrong), which sends you to ...

which sends you to ...

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">voyageurs</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">com/nwvoyage/frames/noframes/</ENAMEX>, where you scroll down a
