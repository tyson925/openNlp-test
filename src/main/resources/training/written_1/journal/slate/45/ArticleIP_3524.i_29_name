            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Composers</ENAMEX> are always setting
to music the words of great poets, but does the music give us any better
understanding of the poetry? There is the case of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Victor Hugo</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poet</ENAMEX> of long
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ago</TIMEX>--born in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1802</TIMEX>, died in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1885</TIMEX>--who in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX> has somehow
risen ghostily from his grandiose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patriot</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tomb</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pantheon</ENAMEX> to become, in
our late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20 th century</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poet</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the hour</TIMEX>, so far as music
goes.

            Music
based on <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Hugo</ENAMEX>'s writings is everywhere <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Les Mis√©rables</ENAMEX> , the
musical based on <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Hugo</ENAMEX>'s novel of the same title, opened in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1980</TIMEX> and,
in a somewhat different English-language version, has been playing on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Broadway</ENAMEX>
and touring the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 years</TIMEX> now, with no sign of disappearing
soon. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last year</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Disney</ENAMEX> came out with an animated movie musical for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
called <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Hunchback</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Notre Dame</ENAMEX> , based on <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Hugo</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Notre-Dame de</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> . <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">This year</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hyperion Records</ENAMEX> has issued a CD, Songs by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Camille</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint-Sa√´ns</ENAMEX>, for piano and voice, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> songs from poems by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hugo</ENAMEX>. Which is to say, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Victor Hugo</ENAMEX>, rendered into music, is coming at us from
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> directions <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, triophonically, so to speak--as a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Broadway</ENAMEX>
extravaganza, as a mass entertainment for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, and more arcanely, as
classical music in a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">19 th</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> style.

            You might suppose that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hugo</ENAMEX> himself, or his shade, faced
with these sundry renditions, would take particular exception to the idea of a
movie cartoon for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>. But that is not so certain. Sometimes <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Hugo</ENAMEX> welcomed
adaptations of his writings, and as for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, he wrote a volume of poetry,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L'Art d'√™tre</ENAMEX> grand-p√®re , devoted largely to the topic of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>'s
play. It's true that in The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hunchback of Notre Dame Disney</ENAMEX> has done a
wretched job, though. The technique of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Disney</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX>, like that of The
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Invasion of the Body-Snatchers</ENAMEX> , is to get hold of the outer shell of
someone else's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">de</ENAMEX>-souled creation--<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Hugo</ENAMEX>'s medieval fantasies, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">A.A. Milne</ENAMEX>'s
stories about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Winnie</ENAMEX>-the-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pooh</ENAMEX>, or anything at all--and fill it with a creepy,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">committee</ENAMEX>-derived, cheerful substance of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Disney</ENAMEX>'s own. That is a pity, not to
mention a crime.

            The songs
in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Disney</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hunchback</ENAMEX> , by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Menken</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Schwartz</ENAMEX>, are a
mishmash of the ersatz--sometimes imitating the old-fashioned <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Broadway</ENAMEX>
cleverness of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Gershwin</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ira</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lyricist</ENAMEX> (as in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hunchback</ENAMEX> 's "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A Guy Like You</ENAMEX>," sung by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stone gargoyles</ENAMEX>, which you can
listen to briefly by clicking , though I don't advise it), other times
imitating the modern <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Broadway</ENAMEX> cleverness of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Les Mis</ENAMEX> (as in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hunchback</ENAMEX> 's opening number, which you can also listen to with a click ,
though why?). But there's no point in looking for <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Hugo</ENAMEX> in any of that--even if
it's worth noting that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Disney</ENAMEX>'s single inspiration of any worth in
Hunchback , the talking stone statues, was originally conceived by <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Hugo</ENAMEX>
himself, in his epic poem <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La L√©gende des Si√®cles .</ENAMEX>

            
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iwent</ENAMEX> to see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Les Mis</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Broadway</ENAMEX> show,
expecting something no better than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Disney</ENAMEX> production, given the tinsel
stupidity of most <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Broadway</ENAMEX> musicals <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Les Mis</ENAMEX> , as untold
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of theatergoers have discovered before me, turns out to be an
intelligent and moving show. Technically speaking, it is an opera, all singing
and no talking--except that, unlike a regular opera, the music, by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Claude-Michel Sch√∂nberg</ENAMEX>, is intended strictly as a velvet background (velvet?
Click to see what I mean) intended to display the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jewels</ENAMEX>, which are the lyrics.
These lyrics have been composed by a committee consisting of, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">French</ENAMEX>
original, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alain Boublil</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jean-Marc Natel</ENAMEX>, with the addition, for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">English</ENAMEX>
version, of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herbert Kretzmer</ENAMEX>, aided by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Fenton</ENAMEX>--this last <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> being a
first-rate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poet</ENAMEX> and arts <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critic</ENAMEX>, well known to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> of the New York
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Review of Books</ENAMEX> . From this assemblage has come more lyrics than you would
think possible in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an evening</TIMEX>'s entertainment--wordy rhyming couplets pouring
outward from the stage in a ceaseless gush, until you feel you have been
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">drenched</ENAMEX> (as you will see, if you click ).

            The
lyrics tell a story that sticks pretty closely to <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Hugo</ENAMEX>'s novel and even to its
left-wing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spirit</ENAMEX>, which I much appreciate. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Les Mis</ENAMEX> is decently Hugolian
in that respect. Even the rhyming couplets stand closer to <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Hugo</ENAMEX>'s spirit than
you might imagine. His own <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">theater</ENAMEX> plays--his play <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hernani</ENAMEX> , for example,
which set off a riot in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> when it was originally staged in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1830</TIMEX>--consist in
large part of very similar verse. The only difference is that, in <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Hugo</ENAMEX>'s
original writings, the wordy rhymed couplets conjure a feeling of endless
verbal ingenuity, advancing majestically at a stately pace--whereas, with the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lyricists</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committee</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Les Mis</ENAMEX> , everything rushes forward pell-mell, as
always in modern <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Broadway</ENAMEX> productions, and clich√©s tread on one another's
heels, and you have this feeling of a hidden stage <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> crying, "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Next</ENAMEX>!
Next!"

            If you want the true <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Victor Hugo</ENAMEX> rendered into music, you
have to get hold of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hyperion</ENAMEX>'s CD of Songs by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Camille Saint-Sa√´ns</ENAMEX> , very
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">capably</ENAMEX> performed by the baritone <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fran√ßois Le Roux</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pianist</ENAMEX> (and music
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">scholar) Graham Johnson</ENAMEX>. The songs are in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>, of course, which is part of
what it means to have the true <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Hugo</ENAMEX>, who once said, "The measure of a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intelligence</ENAMEX> is its ability to speak <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">French</ENAMEX>." They are written in the light,
teary, lovely style of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">19 th</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> song--the style that you
can see in a little pastoral love poem of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Hugo</ENAMEX>'s, with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">singer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pianist</ENAMEX>
joined by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philippa Davies</ENAMEX> on flute, by clicking . The songs convey some of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">orderliness</ENAMEX> and purity of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Hugo</ENAMEX>'s poetic imagination, his unflappable fluency,
his verse structures varying with perfect control, as if every possible
variation on rhythmic and melodic order lay easily within his grasp--as in, for
instance, the opening <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX> that you can hear by clicking .

            But is
there any advantage in listening to <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Hugo</ENAMEX>--or to any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poet</ENAMEX>--through the
soundboard of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">composer</ENAMEX>'s music? I find it enjoyable to listen to the musical
settings by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint-Sa√´ns</ENAMEX>, but then again, a little disappointing. Poetry
contains its own music, even if the music is only hinted at, and if some
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">composer</ENAMEX> comes along and fills in the hints with imaginings of his own, the
effect is to close off possibilities for your own imagination. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Claude Debussy</ENAMEX>
once said to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">St√©phane Mallarm√</ENAMEX>© that he had set a poem of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mallarm√</ENAMEX>©'s to
music--to which the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poet</ENAMEX> is said to have replied, "I thought I had already done
that."

            
The splendidly incongruous
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20 th -century</TIMEX> musical resurrection of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Victor Hugo</ENAMEX> makes me conclude
that, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">composers</ENAMEX> set a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poet</ENAMEX>'s work to music, the best thing to do is, in
the case of a fiasco like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Disney</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hunchback</ENAMEX> , to stay away completely,
and in the case of a show like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Les Mis</ENAMEX> , to enjoy the story without
paying any attention to the literary art. In the case of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint-Sa√´ns</ENAMEX>, on the
other hand, the best thing is to savor the musical settings and the words,
too--and then put aside the music to enjoy <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Victor Hugo</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poet</ENAMEX>, as presented
by himself on the printed page, with piano accompaniment and vocal sonorities
provided by your own dreamy imagination.
