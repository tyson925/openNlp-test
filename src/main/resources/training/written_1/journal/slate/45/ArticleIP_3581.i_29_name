               Solution
to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Puzzle No. 5</ENAMEX>: "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">From Beatles to Beetles</ENAMEX>"
            

            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last week</TIMEX>,
we asked <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> to get from this page on
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Beatles</ENAMEX> to this
page on beetles in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> links or less. Our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">winner</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reagen Mackie</ENAMEX>, who got
from lovable mop tops to creepy crawlies in an impressive <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> steps. Viswanath
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Subramanian</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tamara Glenny</ENAMEX> also did the deed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> links, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mackie</ENAMEX> did it
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>--you've got to be pretty quick on the draw around these parts. Here's
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mackie</ENAMEX>'s solution:

            The starting page ...
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Beatles</ENAMEX>

            "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Beatles</ENAMEX>
[<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gabe Perlmutter</ENAMEX>]" (Note: This link goes to a dead page but then
automatically proceeds to his new page, so I'm counting it as one link.)

            "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">My Page</ENAMEX>"
(bottom link on left)

            "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Science</ENAMEX>"

            "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">IGC (Habitats &</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Species</ENAMEX>)" (<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">sixth</NUMEX> link in the list)

            "The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smithsonian Natural</ENAMEX>
History Web" (page down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two or three</NUMEX> times)

            "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum Directory</ENAMEX>"

            "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smithsonian Institution</ENAMEX>"
(bottom right icon)

            "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Resources/Tours</ENAMEX>"
(top right icon)

            "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A Kid's Guide</ENAMEX> to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smithsonian</ENAMEX>" (in the lowest selector window; click Go on a Packaged
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tour</ENAMEX> )

            "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Museum</ENAMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Natural History</ENAMEX>" (<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> link)

            "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hiss</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Chirp, Rattle, Click</ENAMEX>!" (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10 th</NUMEX> link in the
list)

            "feed

            Enjoy!
