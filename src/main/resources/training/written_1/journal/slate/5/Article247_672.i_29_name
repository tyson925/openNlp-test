            Everybody leads with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">bad day</TIMEX> in the financial markets. The
headlines speak of a world crisis, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA Today</ENAMEX> ,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>
Times headers refer to the Dow's drop of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">357</NUMEX> points. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX>
headline opts instead to state that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DJ</ENAMEX> was off <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.1 percent</NUMEX>. But none of the
big type mentions what <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAT</ENAMEX> has in its <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> paragraph--this wasn't
even in the Dow's top <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20 bad days</TIMEX>. So one wonders why that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> still fronts
its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX> section with such lines as "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Crisis Hits Home</ENAMEX>" and "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Economic</ENAMEX>
Troubles <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Arrive 'On Our Doorstep</ENAMEX>.'" In the same <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Chicken Little spirit</ENAMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">WP</ENAMEX> lead delays until the sixteenth paragraph the news that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> also
saw the release of strong figures on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> labor market and on housing
starts.

            Everybody duly notes all the overseas financial setbacks. USAT
reports <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> stocks were down <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.55 percent</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> stocks down <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6 percent</NUMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Brazilian</ENAMEX> shares down <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 percent</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> stocks down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX>. The papers have a
word for the cause of all this: <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX>. Except for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> , the papers
pass up the usual trading floor desperation pix in favor of shots of full
contact banking on <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>. Everybody's front describes the mounting
pressure on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boris Yeltsin</ENAMEX> to quit, and report that without the support of
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX>'s central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX>, the ruble has continued to fall. The (mostly
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">non-Russian</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX> that had purchased the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>'s debt now find
themselves, says the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> , holding <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 10 percent</NUMEX> of the value they had
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX>.

            The papers agree that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> fear that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> chaos could spread to
other emerging market economies, such as those in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latin America</ENAMEX>. USAT
says <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX>'s influence in the world markets is due to its nuclear stockpile.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> notes this reasoning, but still wonders--after all, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Russian</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">economy</ENAMEX> is only the size of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Denmark</ENAMEX>'s. But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> notes at least one
clear cause of the meta-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> acceleration: <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX>'s troubles have made it
clear to other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMF</ENAMEX> bail-outs are probably not in the offing for
them and might not work anyway. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> observes that the dubious record of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMF</ENAMEX>
rescue packages in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past year</TIMEX> probably deepens the rift among <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> over whether to give the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> a fresh infusion of federal
billions. (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX> are mostly for that, as is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Newt Gingrich</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dick Armey</ENAMEX> is
deeply opposed.)

            Perhaps the scariest feature of the market turmoil served up by the papers
is the realization that for all their new analytical tools, those in the
business are no more capable of cognitive significance than in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the days</TIMEX> of
ticker tape. Thus, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> quotes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> equities <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader</ENAMEX>" saying, "If
you can withstand the pain and you've chosen good stocks, you should come out
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">okay</ENAMEX>," and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAT</ENAMEX> has another "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">strategist</ENAMEX>" saying, "We could rally from
this, but a lot of damage has been done."

            Everybody has the same off-lead: that federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> have brought into
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> and charged a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">suspect</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">embassy</ENAMEX> bombings. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">suspect</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mohamed Rashed Daoud al-'Owhali</ENAMEX>, was injured in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kenya</ENAMEX> blast and has
reportedly confessed his role to the feds. He is said to have admitted that he
was trained at <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Afghani</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorist camps</ENAMEX> run by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Osama bin Laden</ENAMEX>. A second
suspect, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mohammed Saddiq Odeh</ENAMEX>, is still in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Kenyan</ENAMEX> custody, but is expected in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> soon. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAT</ENAMEX> says he will arrive here <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> run front-page pictures of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>--with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al-'Owhali</ENAMEX> smiling. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">LAT</ENAMEX> quotes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Janet Reno</ENAMEX> saying that the turn in the case came as a result
of the most extensive criminal investigation in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> history. If convicted, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bombers</ENAMEX> could get the death penalty.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> has an interesting detail about the alacrity of the
extradition to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> Apparently, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kenyans</ENAMEX> were worried that prosecuting
any <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bombers</ENAMEX> would expose them to further terrorism. "You'd think," the paper
quotes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX>, "they'd want first crack at these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX>." The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> adds that under a strengthening of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> jurisdiction overseas passed
by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> suspected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX> have been returned here from
overseas. But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> doesn't tell us what then happened to them in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX>.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> runs an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX> report about a recently concluded study of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>' worth of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX> tests given to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">350,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Job Corps</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>. Findings:
the rate of infection among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 16-21</TIMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 percent</NUMEX> higher than that of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> in the same age bracket. And the highest rates of infection were among
black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>--<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> out of every <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,000</NUMEX>.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> 's "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Reliable Source</ENAMEX>" asks who's going to make more money off
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> scandals--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Bennett</ENAMEX>, one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>'s private <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX>, or
his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill</ENAMEX>, author of a new book, "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Death of Outrage</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Clinton</ENAMEX> and
the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Assault on American Ideals"</ENAMEX>?

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> runs a story purporting to cast light on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>'s post-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Monica</ENAMEX>
attitudes towards <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Clinton</ENAMEX>, based, it says, on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozens</NUMEX> of interviews with
"<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> across the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>." It's interesting to see what the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> means
by that phrase. Here is the complete listing, in order of appearance, of the
occupations of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> quoted in the story: <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholder activist</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">novelist</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">graduate</ENAMEX> school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dean</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">volunteer</ENAMEX>, hair salon <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owner</ENAMEX>,
university public relations <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producer</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX>.
Apparently, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> couldn't find any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> who are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretaries</ENAMEX> or
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">housewives</ENAMEX>.
