            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX>
leads with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>'s plan to implement a congressional
requirement to assign every <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> an electronic health identifier code
containing his/her complete medical history. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA Today</ENAMEX>
leads with more bad news for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX>: On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Saturn</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> voted overwhelmingly
to authorize a strike. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> goes with a report being released <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> by
congressional <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX> documenting that the tobacco industry is providing more
travel to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> on corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">jets</ENAMEX> than any other industry. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Angeles Times</ENAMEX> leads with claims by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> of some subpoenaed
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Secret Service</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> that because of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s practices inside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX>, their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> aren't likely to know much about <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s
personal activities. "They're specifically trained," says <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX>,
"not to pay attention [to] what's going on."

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> says the health identifier code would enable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> to
monitor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>' health even if they switch insurance plans, would make
obtaining old medical records much easier, and would streamline billing.
Additionally, putting the code in place would create a national disease
database great for research. Nevertheless, says the paper, privacy advocates
and some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>--including the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMA</ENAMEX>--fear <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Brother</ENAMEX>. Trust in
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX>, they say, would be eroded. And when even the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> gets hacked,
would anyone's medical records be safe?

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> also notes there are disputes about what kind of identifier
should be used. The trouble with just using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> numbers is that too
many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> have access to them. So more complicated
ideas have been proposed: retinal scans or numbers made from such personal
information as date of birth and the latitude and longitude of one's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">hometown</ENAMEX>.
The topic is so controversial--there are, says the paper, already at least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>
related bills circulating in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>--that, starting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HHS</ENAMEX> is calling for
public comment at a series of hearings. Which means the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> is a bit
unfair in saying that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> "is quietly laying plans" for the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">identifier</ENAMEX>.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">USAT</ENAMEX> explains that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Saturn</ENAMEX> strike authorization--voted for by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX>
percent of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> who cast ballots--means that the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> could be
struck with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five day</TIMEX>'s notice. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> , which also fronts the story,
quotes the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">CEO</ENAMEX> saying this is not an actual strike vote and that so
far the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>'s schedule has not been changed. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Workers</ENAMEX>' issues center on
concern about a decreasing role in management, manufacturing and purchasing
decisions, and the outsourcing of work to other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">divisions</ENAMEX> and outside
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">suppliers</ENAMEX>. There's also a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1,000/per</NUMEX> worker dispute about the size of second
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">quarter</TIMEX> bonuses.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> reports that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX> say no <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of their party
traveled on tobacco <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> planes from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 1997 through May 1998</TIMEX>, the
period studied. The paper explains that although <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> must pay the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">companies</ENAMEX>
the cost of a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> class ticket for such flights, their actual cost can be
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tens</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">thousands of dollars</NUMEX> more. The story quotes <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">congressman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Linder</ENAMEX>'s explanation: It's "another big perk we get."

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> takes a snapshot of Web commerce thus
far, concluding that entertainment sites have been a bust and that the only
real profit comes from dull-but-useful informational ones. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Weather Channel</ENAMEX>
site, for instance, draws more traffic than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cbs</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">abc</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">com</ENAMEX> combined. And
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mapquest</ENAMEX> site, which produces custom maps on demand, is busier than the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Disney</ENAMEX> page.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal</ENAMEX> also reports that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">honcho</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Warren Littlefield</ENAMEX> suggests
his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX>, looking at post-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Seinfeld</ENAMEX>, ratings, uh, shrinkage, is actively
considering merging with a cable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> (to get a piece of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subscriber</ENAMEX> fees) or
TV <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">studio</ENAMEX> (to get a piece of syndication fees). Or perhaps, says the paper,
parent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GE</ENAMEX> will sell a minority stake in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> to the public.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> carries an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX> dispatch inside of a tale for our age. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fontana</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>, a distraught man
called the local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> requesting a crisis hot line to call when he felt
like stalking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, which he'd been previously convicted of. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurse</ENAMEX> who
took the call gave him a number she'd found in the white pages. But when she
later found out the number had been reassigned to a sex-talk line, she, worried
that a distraught <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> might be pushed over the edge by sex talk, tried to
get the number changed. But time spent on the phone to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utilities</ENAMEX> commission
and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">attorney general's office</ENAMEX> was to no avail. So, finally she went to the
local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>, which quoted her in its front-page story. That got results: she
got fired.

            A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> op-ed asks an interesting
question: Why isn't <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Viagra</ENAMEX>--like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">anabolic steroids</ENAMEX> and tranquilizers, and
other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> that have a narrowly prescribed intended use--a controlled
substance? If it's drug abuse to take a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pill</ENAMEX> simply to look virile, the piece
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">wonders</ENAMEX>, why isn't it illegal to take <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to become virile? Because, it
answers, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Viagra</ENAMEX> has obvious appeal to rich and powerful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>. And you can be
certain they're not going to jail.
