            Continuing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> debate on the tobacco bill leads <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA Today</ENAMEX> .
New prospects for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nigeria</ENAMEX> lead at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Angeles Times</ENAMEX> goes with a report bearing fresh allegations of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Swiss</ENAMEX>
complicity in the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Holocaust</ENAMEX>.

            The tobacco bill, declared dead by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trent Lott</ENAMEX> just <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the other day</TIMEX>, is still
twitching on the slab. The debate centers, says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAT</ENAMEX> , on the bill's
defining proposition, advocated by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John McCain</ENAMEX> and a host of
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>: a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1.10</NUMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pack</ENAMEX> in new taxes. The bill
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">wrangle</ENAMEX> is also on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> front, but inside at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> .

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX>
lead reports that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX> after taking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nigeria</ENAMEX>'s new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX>, Gen.
Abubakar, apparently among the cadre of army <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> who want the military to
loosen its political control, says he will turn over power to an elected
civilian <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 1st</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> also states that there are hints
from the new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> of the imminent release of many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>'s
numerous political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prisoners</ENAMEX>. Doing so, reports the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> , would win
international praise but domestically could unleash a big popular movement
against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">military</ENAMEX>. Indeed, pro-democracy opposition <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> are calling for a
large demonstration on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> lead says that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> is
offering improved ties with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nigeria</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> if it moves toward democracy,
but contrary to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> says remarks by the new
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> "held little promise of a swift return to civilian rule." However, the
paper goes on to say that because of his military training in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">States</ENAMEX>, Gen.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abubakar</ENAMEX> is thought to be friendly towards the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> puts another nail in the coffin of the image of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Swiss</ENAMEX> purity
during <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX> with word of a
new report from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Simon Wiesenthal Center</ENAMEX> describing how in numerous
secret meetings with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Swiss anti-Semitic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, the wartime Swiss
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minister</ENAMEX> for justice and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> promised that he would stop most <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> from
entering the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. Only a few <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> would be allowed in, he said, and these
solely for the purpose of showing the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Swiss</ENAMEX> public how hard <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> are to live
with. The report contains copies of the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> of these meetings.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> goes top front with words and a picture regarding <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supremacists</ENAMEX> arrested <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX>, charged with killing
a black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> by dragging him behind their <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">several miles</NUMEX>. Nobody else
deems the story front-page news.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> notes that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</TIMEX>'s recall of a
major heart <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Posicor</ENAMEX>, and the disclosure of another <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> deaths of men
taking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Viagra</ENAMEX>, are reminders that "While pharmaceuticals <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturers</ENAMEX> test
their concoctions on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several thousand</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> to monitor side-effects and
efficacy, the real experiment begins only after a drug hits the market and
vastly more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> begin taking it." This is especially true of safety issues
relating to interactions with other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX>. In fact, says the paper, it
took follow-up tests to reveal that one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Posicor</ENAMEX> has interaction
problems with is...<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Viagra</ENAMEX>.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> off-lead is the news that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern Baptists</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s
largest <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Protestant</ENAMEX> denomination, which counts among its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adherents</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Clinton</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Gore</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Newt Gingrich</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trent Lott</ENAMEX>, has, at its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> convention, amended
its statement of essential beliefs to include the declaration that a woman
should "submit herself graciously" to her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX>,
and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> should "provide for, protect and lead his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>." The
Times puts the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>'s responsibilities in its headline, but not the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">man</ENAMEX>'s.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chief Justice</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Rehnquist</ENAMEX> has rejected a request by a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> of minority <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> for a meeting to discuss the dearth of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minorities</ENAMEX>
selected as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Court</ENAMEX> law <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clerks</ENAMEX>, the USAT front says. The matter was first
broached by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAT</ENAMEX> story <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last March</TIMEX> revealing just how few non-whites
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clerk</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supremes</ENAMEX>: <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 2 percent</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">394</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clerks</ENAMEX> ever hired by the
current <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crop</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Justices</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> sitting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Justices</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rehnquist</ENAMEX>, have
never hired a black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clerk</ENAMEX>.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WSJ</ENAMEX> runs a front-page feature about an emerging problem for the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">airlines</ENAMEX>: brazen as well as non-consensual in-flight sex. According to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal</ENAMEX> , wild
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">goings-on</ENAMEX> often lead to explosive conflicts between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crew</ENAMEX>, and in
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> case almost produced a forced landing. Things have gotten so bad
that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">airlines</ENAMEX> are addressing the issue in their training and hiring
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultants</ENAMEX> who specialize in it. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sarah Richfield</ENAMEX> must be very
proud--here she is, just <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> and already written up in the Wall Street
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal</ENAMEX> ! Oh sure, it was for having sex with her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boyfriend</ENAMEX> in the bathroom
on a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> while arguing through the door with the flight attendant telling her
to er, return herself to the fully upright and locked position. Which makes
"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Today's Papers</ENAMEX>" wonder: Why was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Richfield</ENAMEX> mentioned by name in the story,
while the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal</ENAMEX> very decorously referred to another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passenger</ENAMEX>,
ultimately convicted of abusive sexual contact for the aerial fondling of a
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fifteen</NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-year-old</TIMEX>, only as "a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brooklyn</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>"?
