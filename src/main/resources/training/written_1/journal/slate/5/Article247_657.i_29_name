               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>
Today , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> ,
and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> lead with the revelation that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ambassador</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kenya</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudence Bushnell</ENAMEX>, had been so concerned about her
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">embassy</ENAMEX>'s vulnerability that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> before the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nairobi</ENAMEX> bombings, she had asked
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Dept.</ENAMEX> to build a new one--a request that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State</ENAMEX> denied, citing lack of
funds. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los Angeles Times</ENAMEX> , which includes the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bushnell</ENAMEX> story in its
front-page bombing aftermath story, but puts it deep in the story after the
jump, goes instead with the decision by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Swiss</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX> to pay <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1.25 billion</NUMEX> to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Holocaust survivors</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX> to compensate for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Nazi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX>' deposits
they held onto after <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX>, a story that also gets front <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">space</ENAMEX> at
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAT</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> . The move came just <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX> after the Swiss
government had declared it would pay <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">no more than half</NUMEX> that sum, but also, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> points out, after several <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> and local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX>, in defiance
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> position, said they would begin leveling
sanctions against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX>.

            According to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Ambassador</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bushnell</ENAMEX>'s main <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> was that her
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">post</ENAMEX> was located on a crowded downtown <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAT</ENAMEX> and the WP
report that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bushnell</ENAMEX> even wrote directly to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madeleine</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albright</ENAMEX> about the problem, going so far, says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAT</ENAMEX> , as inviting her to
come see for herself, something <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albright</ENAMEX> never did. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> adds that
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> military <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">command</ENAMEX> covering the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> also expressed concern about the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">embassy</ENAMEX>'s security. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> quote <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> claiming
that even if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bushnell</ENAMEX>'s request had been honored, the completion of a new
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">embassy</ENAMEX> would have taken <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, and hence the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> would have still occupied
the old one at the time of the bombing. None of the reporting mentions it, but
this sort of development is sadly familiar--it was reported after the fact that
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marines</ENAMEX>' commanding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beirut</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1983</TIMEX> had expressed grave concern
to his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">superiors</ENAMEX> about the vulnerability of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> to hostile forces
operating in the area.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> has a front-page story confirming that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kenya</ENAMEX>
rubble known to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rescuers</ENAMEX> only as "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Rose</ENAMEX>" (full name: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rose Wanjiku Mwangi</ENAMEX>) was
found dead on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX>. Her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> had been protected from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> stories of
rubble by a table. She had been dead for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">as little as 24 hours</TIMEX> when she was
found.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> reports that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Tanzanian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> are looking for the assistant to
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">driver</ENAMEX> of the water <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">truck</ENAMEX> believed to have harbored the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bomb</ENAMEX> deployed
against the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">embassy</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dar-es-Salaam</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">driver</ENAMEX>, believed to
have been a faithful embassy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX>, was found in the wreckage. The
assistant's was not.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> front reports that the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinton</ENAMEX> legal defense fund, free of some of the legal
restrictions of the old one that was disbanded <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier this year</TIMEX>, has already
been much more successful, bringing in <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $2 million</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">just six months</TIMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> says funds have come in from "<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Main Street</ENAMEX>, Wall Street and
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX>," in response to a direct mail campaign seizing on hostility toward
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth Starr</ENAMEX>, but makes it seem that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX> has been particularly
important, mentioning such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Geffen</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Hanks</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven Spielberg</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeffrey Katzenberg</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harvey Weinstein</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bud Yorkin</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Geffen</ENAMEX> is quoted
explaining his <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$10,000</NUMEX> donation this way: "There is a well-financed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">zealots</ENAMEX> who want to bring down the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX>. And this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> has no money. He's
broke. This is a terrible situation." The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clintons</ENAMEX>' legal expenses are now
estimated at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$6 million</NUMEX>, with the potential, says the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> , to grow at
a clip of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1 million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX>.

            A staple newspaper feature is the academic convention piece, which features
elbow-patched and distracted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professors</ENAMEX> virtually unaware that they've plopped
down into a big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX> in a big <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> because they're so terminally immersed in
their profession, such as it is. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> features a particularly ripe
target for the genre--a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">philosophers</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">convention</ENAMEX>. Imagine--<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">academics</ENAMEX> in one
hotel, not one of them sure the others are really there too! But before you
laugh too much at these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Platos</ENAMEX> without a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Republic</ENAMEX>, consider this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX>
factoid: the employment rate for philosophy Ph.D.'s is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">98.9 percent</NUMEX>.
