            Banner headlines at all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX> announce that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monica Lewinsky</ENAMEX> has been given
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">immunity</ENAMEX>, meaning that she may testify before a grand jury <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">as early as next</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week</TIMEX>. Her transactional immunity agreement guarantees that she can't be
prosecuted for past perjury or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witness</ENAMEX> tampering. (She can be prosecuted if she
lies to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">grand jury</ENAMEX>--including <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX>'s--in the future.) All <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX> agree that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX> will admit to sex with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>. But the various <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX>' unnamed
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> disagree on whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> asked her to lie--a question
that is "the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">marrow</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX>'s inquiry," according to the New York
Times .

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> headline reports <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX> "agrees to tell of pact with
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> to lie." The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> disagrees: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> did
not ask her to lie, though the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> discussed how to avoid cooperating
with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paula Jones</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA Today</ENAMEX> carries <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a third</NUMEX> version, saying that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX>
discussed her testimony only with "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">associates</ENAMEX>." And the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>
Times carries yet a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX> doesn't claim to have discussed
testimony with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> and says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> never asked her to lie. Both the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> report that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX> claims no one from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> helped her write the infamous "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Talking Points</ENAMEX>" memo.

            A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> editorial says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> is "in the pincers of an excruciating
legal squeeze", urges him to come clean with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, and predicts
that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> won't impeach him even if he admits to having sex with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX>
and lying afterwards. The corresponding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> editorial applauds the fact
that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> will hear what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX> has to say, and asks the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> to
refrain from savaging her. Another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> story reports that one of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monica</ENAMEX> has shown "a shocking amount of grace and
dignity," over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last six months</TIMEX>. If <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Today's Papers</ENAMEX> ever musters any grace
and dignity, he certainly hopes his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> won't find it "shocking."

            All of the major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX> run page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> stories on a tentative accord
between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Auto Workers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Motors</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Factories</ENAMEX> may rev up
conveyer belts <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">as early as tomorrow</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> agreed to increase investment
in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> and, in return, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAW</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> agreed to end their strike--but the
tentative agreement only addresses some of the labor-management disputes,
others will crop up again. Industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> think <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">loser</ENAMEX>. Astonishing
statistic from the WP : <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> is so enormous that production losses from the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">54-day</TIMEX> strike will reduce the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX> GDP by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.5%</NUMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX>
reports that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> plans to run its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factories</ENAMEX> around the clock, thereby
compensating for lost production, perhaps even recouping <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> its lost profits.
Did the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> think of that when it made its calculation?

            The obit pages report that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William McChesney Martin, Jr.</ENAMEX>, former chair of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Reserve</ENAMEX>, died on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin</ENAMEX> earned himself a place in every
macroeconomics textbook by quipping that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>'s mission is "to take away the
punch bowl just when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> gets going."
