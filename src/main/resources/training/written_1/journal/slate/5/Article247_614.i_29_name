               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>
Today , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> all lead with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s speech to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beijing University</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>
Times leads with a regional story on the debate over how to use
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>'s budget surplus: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX> want across-the-board increases in
welfare aid; <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> want to restrict the increases to the blind, aged, and
disabled.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX>' early editions spin <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Beijing</ENAMEX> speech in vastly different
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ways</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAT</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> all judge the talk a
human-rights statement, emphasizing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s line that "certain rights are
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">universal</ENAMEX>" and are "the birthrights of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> everywhere." The USAT
sub-headline: "<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2nd</NUMEX> televised talk stresses human rights." But the WP
disagrees: "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aides</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>'s aim was to avoid a lecture about human
rights--which he felt the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> would dismiss as hectoring by an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">outsider</ENAMEX>."
While the other papers all call this the centerpiece of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> trip,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> claims that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> thought the televised press conference
with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jiang Zemin</ENAMEX> had usurped this role, and so were downplaying the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX>
speech. Two more details set the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> story apart: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) It alone reports
that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> "scrapped" the speech his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aides</ENAMEX> wrote and penned a new one
himself, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) Its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> alone openly admits he has only read an advance
copy of the speech, and not yet seen <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinton</ENAMEX> deliver it. Were the other papers
able to file later? Or (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TP</ENAMEX>'s hunch) are they concealing what the WP
reveals?

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> front page reports on the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> epidemic among
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">African-Americans</ENAMEX>. The initial sentences suggest a fast-growing plague: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blacks</ENAMEX>
"now account for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">57%</NUMEX> of all new infections" with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV; AIDS</ENAMEX> is "the leading
cause of death among black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">aged 25 to 44</TIMEX>"; and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> "is becoming largely
an epidemic among black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>." Not until the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> paragraph does the paper
explain that "the recent demographic shifts.are due more to a sharp drop in
cases among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX> than an increase among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX>." The rest of the story
focuses on the failure of black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> and institutions to confront the
problem: No one wants to talk about <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX>.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> report inside that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX> family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dale</ENAMEX>
Young told a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">grand jury</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monica Lewinsky</ENAMEX> spoke of an affair with the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> adds that, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Young</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX> said "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>
set certain limits, engaging in physical activity without allowing it to reach
a sexual culmination."

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">railroads</ENAMEX> want to use a
satellite positioning system to avoid collisions. Not only would the system
make trains safer, it might reduce travel time, allowing more efficient
scheduling and faster speeds. Problem: The technology is expensive and years
away.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> reports that a deranged <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Manhattanite</ENAMEX> fired <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> times at a
homeless <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who was trying to talk to him. All the shots missed their target,
but <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> hit a nearby tourist in the leg. Poor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mayor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giuliani</ENAMEX>. You try to get
rid of the homeless and boost tourism, and look how things turn out.
