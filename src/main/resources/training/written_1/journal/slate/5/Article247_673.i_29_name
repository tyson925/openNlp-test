            The crisis in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> leads at all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX>--the New York
Times , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los Angeles Times</ENAMEX> --though the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> tucks the
story under a banner headline on market dives and global turmoil. Each
front-page features a photo of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boris Yeltsin</ENAMEX>, his hands raised, defiantly
refuting rumors of his resignation. In <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeltsin</ENAMEX>'s words: "I'm not going to
resign . . . In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>, there will be an election for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>, and I will not
run." But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeltsin</ENAMEX>'s determined words belie his weak physical appearance and
waning power. The papers note that an agreement reached <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX> to shift
substantial power away from the presidency and over to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">parliament</ENAMEX> (the
State <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Duma</ENAMEX>) constitutes a likely setback for reform. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> is the only
paper with high-up mention of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeltsin</ENAMEX>'s latest sackings: Anatoly Chubias
(<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">envoy</ENAMEX> to international financial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX>) and deputy prime
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boris Nemtsov</ENAMEX>.

            All papers run above-the-fold stories recapping Wall Street's worst week
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> (and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the worst week</TIMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October '89</TIMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow</ENAMEX> dropped <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">114</NUMEX> points
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX>, extending <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">357</NUMEX>-point dive. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX>'s markets also dropped
sharply on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX>, with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX> dipping to a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12-year</TIMEX> low. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> the economy
remained virtually frozen--stocks were traded at very low volume <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moscow</ENAMEX>'s main currency exchange stayed shut.

            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Next week</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeltsin-Clinton</ENAMEX> summit in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moscow</ENAMEX> gets front-page play at the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> and gets inside features elsewhere. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> predicts the
summit will yield "psychic solace but little tangible assistance." <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Newt</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gingrich</ENAMEX> for one foresees no psychic solace: he tells the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s trip is "imprudent" considering <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX>'s current state. The chaos
certainly makes trip logistics a nightmare, as all papers note. Interesting
angle not mentioned in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX>: What is the status of security
preparations?

            All papers report (the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> inside) that a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">suspect</ENAMEX> in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> bombings, arraigned in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>, has admitted ties to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorist financier</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Osama bin Laden</ENAMEX>. A related <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">front-pager</ENAMEX> says that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bin Laden</ENAMEX> was in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> camps <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> of the attack, but moved before
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missiles</ENAMEX> struck. The story also says that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> began formulating
retaliation plans against bin <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laden</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Afghan</ENAMEX> stronghold in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June</TIMEX>.

            A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> front-page story keeps up the heat on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> who
maintain that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Sudanese</ENAMEX> pharmaceutical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> was a legitimate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX>. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">article</ENAMEX> chronicles numerous <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> changes-of-story. It also says that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">President</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> "personally chose the bombing site [in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sudan</ENAMEX>] . . . declining to strike
any other among a larger set of targets presented to him by military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planners</ENAMEX>."
The article adds that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> may not have known that the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> was a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.N.</ENAMEX>-affiliated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factory</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s speech at a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martha</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Vineyard</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> makes the front
page at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> . While not alluding directly to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX> scandal, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> emphasizes forgiveness. (He also compares himself to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nelson Mandela</ENAMEX> in needing to forgive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tormentors</ENAMEX>.) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> is largely
sympathetic.

            A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Style</ENAMEX>" section piece says that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX> still carry
on in "all-out wretched-excess mode" about <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Princess</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diana</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">almost a year</TIMEX> after
her death. However, some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> dare to predict that this may be the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Princess</ENAMEX>'s last media hurrah. Supporting evidence: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> showed up to a
commemorative march <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last weekend</TIMEX> when <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15,000</NUMEX> were expected. Counter-evidence:
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">London's Daily Mail</ENAMEX> netted <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> when it serialized <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diana</ENAMEX>,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Untold Story</ENAMEX> .

            A mock-epic on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> op-ed page replays the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Trojan War</ENAMEX> as a
steroid-aided battle, a la the controversy over <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark McGwire</ENAMEX>'s use of
over-the-counter muscle-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">builders</ENAMEX>. The wily <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Odysseus</ENAMEX> slips <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Achilles</ENAMEX> some
androstenedione, while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apollo</ENAMEX> stokes the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trojan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defenders</ENAMEX> on creatine. All
contenders show the requisite deference toward <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Anabolis</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">goddess</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroids</ENAMEX>.
