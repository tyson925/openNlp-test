            The expected grand jury testimony <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monica Lewinsky</ENAMEX> leads at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA Today</ENAMEX> and
gets subhead billing in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> 's lead, which is about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinton</ENAMEX>
administration's revival of the claim of executive privilege in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX>
matter. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX>
plays <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monica</ENAMEX>'s imminent testimony below the fold (as does the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>
Times ), leading instead with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iraqis</ENAMEX>' umpteenth snit over <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.N.</ENAMEX>
weapons inspections, which is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> 's top national story, and which
also gets top front placement at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAT</ENAMEX> . (But doesn't make the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX>
front.)

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAT</ENAMEX> lead states that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX> is prepared to testify that she
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> had a sexual relationship and that although she was never
directly told to lie under oath about it, she was given suggestions it should
be kept secret. And "prepared" here, the paper specifies, means that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX>
spent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> going through a "final rehearsal" of her testimony with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ken</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAT</ENAMEX> somehow refrains from calling it a "dress"
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rehearsal</ENAMEX>. Spending <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> this way raises a question not addressed in any of
the coverage to date: How come it's ok for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> to do all these dry runs?
Isn't this just coaching the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witness</ENAMEX>? The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nation</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newspaper</ENAMEX> makes the nifty
observation that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> marked the beginning of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> of
investigating <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> oversells its <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> lead in saying that the latest developments mark "the first
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>" <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX> said he was ending all cooperation with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.N.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inspectors</ENAMEX>.
Especially since just a few paragraphs in, the story quotes chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inspector</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Butler</ENAMEX> as saying "...there is a <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">syndrome</ENAMEX> here--going around the same
track again and again." And a little further below that, it quotes a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Security Council</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> saying, "We've heard this bluster before."

            Now that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinton</ENAMEX> staff <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lanny Breuer</ENAMEX> is invoking executive privilege
to keep from having a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX> grand jury sit-down, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> usefully
documents the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>'s legal tacking by quoting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counsel</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Ruff</ENAMEX>'s comments from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two months ago</TIMEX>: "We have no intention of asserting
the privilege, executive privilege, in any situation that I'm aware of."

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> 's "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Column One</ENAMEX>" says that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven Spielberg</ENAMEX>'s "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Saving Private</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ryan</ENAMEX>" ends <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> of silence about the horrors experienced by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX>
in <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War</ENAMEX> II. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last week</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAT</ENAMEX> ran a big front-page piece saying the
same thing. But what of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Heller</ENAMEX>'s Catch <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kurt Vonnegut</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slaughterhouse Five</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Fussell</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wartime</ENAMEX> and Doing
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Battle</ENAMEX> , or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald Reagan</ENAMEX>'s (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peggy Noonan</ENAMEX>'s) <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1984</TIMEX> "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Boys of Pointe du Hoc</ENAMEX>"
speech? Isn't this just another annoying example of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Boomers</ENAMEX> mistakenly thinking
they discovered, nay, invented, something that's been around for quite a while?
(You know, like having <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and working hard.)

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> follows up its front-page scoop that <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX> was
horrible with its front-page <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Shaw</ENAMEX> scoop that as internet and cable news
outlets proliferate, the pressure to be <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> is, in the quoted words of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan</ENAMEX>
Rather, "greater and stronger." Other talking heads brought on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> include
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Kovach</ENAMEX>, the "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Curator of Neiman Fellowships in Journalism</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard</ENAMEX>
University" (point: working fast leads to mistakes) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marvin Kalb</ENAMEX>, "executive
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Joan Shorenstein Center</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Press</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Politics</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Public</ENAMEX>
Policy" (point: being first is profitable). When was the last time <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shaw</ENAMEX> did a
piece that didn't quote all these media <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mafiosi</ENAMEX>? And would it be too much to
ask that their ideas be more substantial than their job titles?

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> reports that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golden Books</ENAMEX>, off of
disastrous <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">first-half</TIMEX> results, has hired a media investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">banker</ENAMEX> to explore
"strategic opportunities." It's not just that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toys</ENAMEX> "<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>" Us isn't stocking as
many books as it used to--hey, there's also the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shari Lewis</ENAMEX> death to contend
with.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the bigger challenges faced by contemporary journalism is
convincingly dressing up its desire to dig dirt in the clothes of some
principle or other. Consider the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> 's editorial on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Monica</ENAMEX>'s imminent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">grand jury</ENAMEX> appearance, which
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> that her testimony "offers a welcome opportunity to turn this
investigation away from the fascinating but tangential privilege questions
about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Secret Service</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> in which it has so long
been mired. It is a chance to get back to the core issues Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX> was asked
to address." Fascinating privilege questions? Core issues Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX> was asked
to address? Yeah, right.
