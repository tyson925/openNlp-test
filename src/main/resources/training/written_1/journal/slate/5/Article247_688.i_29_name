            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>'s response to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX> report leads at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sunday</ENAMEX>
papers. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX>
calls the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42</NUMEX>-page counter-attack a "scathing rebuttal," the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> opts for "blistering counterattack," and
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Angeles Times</ENAMEX> calls it "<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>-worded." It's sound bite heaven for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s legal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX>, as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX>' leads include the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX>'s characterization of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX> investigation as a "hit-and-run smear
campaign." The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> lead gives the most details about the contents of the
document, or "referral," as it is officially known. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> go lighter on the details, but spend more time stressing the
significance of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX> who want the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> to accept some form of
punishment.

            All the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX> run stories on the rest of the world's reaction to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX>
report. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> reports that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> press blasted <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> for his
lying and cheating, while <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> papers expressed their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>'s predominant
view on the matter--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s affair should remain private. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> notes
the "almost funereal somberness" of most world <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> who see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s
troubles as yet another setback in an already difficult <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX>.

            A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> front page piece examines a prickly side-effect of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">report</ENAMEX>'s release: the heightened risk of curious <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten-year-olds</TIMEX> asking <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">parents</ENAMEX>
what "oral sex" is. Although "ask your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>" seems like an appealing response
for dads, the paper cites "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">therapists</ENAMEX>" who say <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> should discuss the
matter with their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and encourage the young<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">'uns</ENAMEX> to lead the conversation
and tell what they already know.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> reports that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this weekend</TIMEX>'s elections in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bosnia</ENAMEX> may be the
most important since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 43-month war ended in 1995</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Voters</ENAMEX> must choose between
hard-line <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nationalists</ENAMEX> and moderate, reconciliation-minded <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX>. The
rejection of the latter could mean the failure of Western <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diplomats</ENAMEX>' peace
efforts in the region.

            An LAT front page piece claims that despite promises to break up
incestuous business-government relationships, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Korea</ENAMEX> still has not carried
out reforms it agreed to as part of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last years</TIMEX>' international bail out.
Apparently, big-business has actually gained power by profiting from
high-interest loans that are driving medium to small-size <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> into
bankruptcy. Meanwhile, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s economy continues to suffer, with the lower
and middle economic classes taking the hardest hit.

            The last words of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Swissair</ENAMEX> Flight 111's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX>--captured by the cockpit
voice recorder--will not be released to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX>, according to an inside
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">article</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> . Like most <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> aside from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> law
precludes the public disclosure of any dialogue from the cockpit
recordings.

            A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> op-ed asks several public figures, including <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mario Cuomo</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William F. Buckley Jr.</ENAMEX>, to recommend comeback strategies for the down-and-out
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX>. The show is stolen, however, by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Trump</ENAMEX>, recent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trump</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Art of the Comeback</ENAMEX>. No stranger to scandal and hard times,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trump</ENAMEX> advises the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> to rid his mind of troublesome <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> by dumping his
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>, and job--so that he can finally have some fun.
