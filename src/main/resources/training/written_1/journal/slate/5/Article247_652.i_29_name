            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los Angeles Times</ENAMEX> all go with across-the-top leads
and gruesome photos of wreckage from massive <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX> bombings at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Embassies</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX>. The attacks in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nairobi</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kenya</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dar es Salaam</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tanzania</ENAMEX>, occurred less than <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five minutes</TIMEX> apart, though the worst damage was in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kenya</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">At least 80</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> died (including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>) and over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1700</TIMEX> were
injured. Even as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX> went to press, screams were still heard from people
trapped under the wreckage.

            Who is responsible? This is a front-page question for all papers. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> are largely discounted; initially at least, experienced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX> from
the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Middle East</ENAMEX> seem more likely <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX>. Though the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX>
refuses to speculate on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attackers</ENAMEX>' identities, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> cites a
senior <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> intelligence <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> as saying that "based on early circumstantial
evidence, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> were focusing on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">followers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Osama bin Laden</ENAMEX>." Bin
Laden is a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Saudi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">multimillionaire</ENAMEX> who has pledged a holy war against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX>, and who is widely considered responsible for the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> attack in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi</ENAMEX>
Arabia which killed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">airmen</ENAMEX>. Another possibility is the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Egyptian</ENAMEX> group
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Islamic Jihad</ENAMEX>, which <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier this week</TIMEX> issued <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-American</ENAMEX> warnings in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Egyptian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Al-Hayat</ENAMEX> . <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> has dispatched top-notch
investigative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> to the scene, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> stated, "We will use
all the means at our disposal to bring those responsible to justice, no matter
what or how long it takes."

            All papers use separate stories to spotlight the security weaknesses at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">embassies</ENAMEX> (only the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> 's story runs inside). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> 's accusatory
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">headline</ENAMEX> says, "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Neither Embassy Met Current Security Guidelines</ENAMEX>." The WP
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">headline</ENAMEX>, however, is more realistic-- "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Embassies Can Never Be Fully</ENAMEX>
Protected." The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> writes that since the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beirut</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kuwait</ENAMEX> bombings,
more than <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1 billion</NUMEX> has been spent to upgrade certain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">embassies</ENAMEX> to become
"state-of-the-art anti-terrorist fortresses." <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kenya</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tanzania</ENAMEX> were
considered relatively low security risk and thus were not among the upgrade
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX>.

            The terrorist attacks relegated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monicagate</ENAMEX> to the bottom of the front at all
papers. The latest development is that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth Starr</ENAMEX> has run afoul of a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">District Court</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX>. Court papers unsealed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX> showed that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norma</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Holloway Johnson</ENAMEX> ordered a probe of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June</TIMEX> over the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">grand</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jury</ENAMEX> leaks. She noted the "serious and repetitive nature" of the leaks,
as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX>'s demonstrated willingness to feed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX> information.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX> appealed parts of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June</TIMEX> ruling, and got a slight break <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last Monday</TIMEX>
when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Court of Appeals</ENAMEX> ruled that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> could not
question <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecutors</ENAMEX> or subpoena documents in the investigation. Nonetheless,
as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> says, the whole matter represents a "stinging rebuke" for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX>, and the investigation into the grand jury leaks continues.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> runs an inside story on the Internet as a time-suck (never
knew that, didya?) Specifically, it's loading web pages. The story cites a
report from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NetRatings</ENAMEX> that "the average home Internet user <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wastes</ENAMEX> just over
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nine</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> per day, or <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">55 hours</TIMEX> per year, waiting for web pages to load."
This otherwise depressing calculation is a persuasive argument for getting TP
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">emailed</ENAMEX> to your account--it saves you the bother of loading the page.
