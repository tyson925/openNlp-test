               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> leads with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX>'s withdrawal from the market of a
widely used heart <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX>. (The story is flagged on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> front and runs inside at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> and the New York
Times .) The heart attack death of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Nigerian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dictator</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sani Abacha</ENAMEX>, leads
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> and is also the top non-local story at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> . (Abacha
also gets front-page space at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>
Times .) The <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$32 billion</NUMEX> bank merger of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wells Fargo</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Norwest</ENAMEX> leads at
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> , which also features top of the page pictures of the three
remaining <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Beatles</ENAMEX> together in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Linda McCartney</ENAMEX> memorial service.
It was their <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> joint public appearance since the "rooftop session" at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abbey</ENAMEX>
Road in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1969</TIMEX>.

            Other stories getting lots of front and front-section space include: the
federal anti-trust suit brought against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intel</ENAMEX> for allegedly withholding
technical data from such <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Digital</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Compaq</ENAMEX> as punishment for not
licensing their technology to the chip <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">maker</ENAMEX>; the decision of the European
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Union</ENAMEX>--and soon, it's reported, of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> too--to ban new investments in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Serbia</ENAMEX> and to freeze its foreign assets as a sanction against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Serbia</ENAMEX> for its
latest military actions against <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Albanians</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kosovo</ENAMEX>; and the agreement by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Honda</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> to pay <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$24.9 million</NUMEX> in civil fines to settle <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> claims that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> arranged for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> to emit substantially more
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pollutants</ENAMEX> than they are supposed to. There is very little explanation in these
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Honda/Ford</ENAMEX> stories about why the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> did this. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAT</ENAMEX> and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> say <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> did it to improve <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">fuel</ENAMEX> economy, but don't really get into
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Honda</ENAMEX>'s motivation. And the other papers miss the explanatory boat regarding
both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roche Laboratories</ENAMEX> pulled its heart <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Posicor</ENAMEX> off the world market Monday
because of potentially lethal interactions with numerous other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX>. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX>, says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAT</ENAMEX> , has received reports of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> deaths that may be related to
the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medication</ENAMEX>, which is used for chest pain and high blood pressure by about
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> worldwide--<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200,000</NUMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> says the death of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nigeria</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abacha</ENAMEX>, whose <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five-year</TIMEX> reign was marked by his
brutal suppression of political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponents</ENAMEX> and who had no designated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">successor</ENAMEX>,
initially prompted hopes among <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Nigerian</ENAMEX> political exiles and some world leaders
that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nigeria</ENAMEX>, which had a flourishing democracy briefly in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1980s</TIMEX>,
might restore civilian <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>. But it was not to be--within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dictator</ENAMEX>'s defense <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> was sworn in as the new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX>, and for the moment
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">anyhow</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">democrats</ENAMEX> and other political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prisoners</ENAMEX> remain behind bars and in
some cases, under death sentences.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> reports that the merger of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wells Fargo</ENAMEX>
with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minneapolis</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Norwest</ENAMEX> will create the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">seventh</NUMEX> largest bank
and the largest <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> based west of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mississippi</ENAMEX>. The story carries warnings
from consumer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activists</ENAMEX> of higher fees and poorer service, but also notes that
the deal could be an economic boost to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>, because the combined
operation will be headquartered in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX>.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAT</ENAMEX> 's news <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">section</ENAMEX> "cover story," about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NRA</ENAMEX>'s attempt to go
mainstream via <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charlton Heston</ENAMEX>'s image, is illustrated by the same loopy
photograph of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Heston</ENAMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> used when it did that story
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX>.

            With everybody else giving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> travel advice <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these days</TIMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Friedman</ENAMEX> can't resist following suit. On your way <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> from
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>, he writes, stop in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX>. His reasoning is pretty simple: "Looked at a
map of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Asia</ENAMEX> lately? <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>'s got the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bomb</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>'s got the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bomb</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>'s got the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bomb</ENAMEX>. Let's see, who's next to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>...<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX>."

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> report that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">William</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cohen</ENAMEX>, announced <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> will investigate allegations made
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time/CNN</ENAMEX> report that in a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1970</TIMEX> raid on a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Laos</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> used nerve <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> on suspected <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defectors</ENAMEX> living
there. If the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cohen</ENAMEX> investigation is for real it will extend to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bobby Garwood</ENAMEX>,
the last <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldier</ENAMEX> to come home alive from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indochina</ENAMEX> war. The SECDEF
should ask <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Garwood</ENAMEX> if he believes he was ever targeted for death by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> forces
while at large in the jungle. And here's an interesting question <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s
newspaper accounts don't address: Why would there be a commando raid to
kill <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">defectors</ENAMEX> instead of bringing them back to be
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">court-martialed</ENAMEX>? It might seem that this oddity proves the raids never
happened. But think about it--if the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX> were in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Laos</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1970</TIMEX>,
they were part of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX>'s "secret war," which had a chance to remain secret
only if...they didn't come back from it.
