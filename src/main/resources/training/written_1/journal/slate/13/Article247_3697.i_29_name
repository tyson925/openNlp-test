            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dear David</ENAMEX>,

            I do look forward to your book, some of which, or at
least some of the research reports for, I have been reading in the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Weekly</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Standard</ENAMEX> and elsewhere. It is a strange
situation we have with our current <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elite</ENAMEX>, as you point out. In some other
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> where there is affirmative action, it is a majority that imposes
affirmative action for itself, for example, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Malays</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malaysia</ENAMEX>. Here we
have it for a small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minority</ENAMEX> (the key <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">beneficiary</ENAMEX> is the black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>
percent of the total) and university <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">presidents</ENAMEX>, almost all major foundation
heads, etc.--defend this system vigorously even though it reduces, perhaps only
minimally, its own advantages. You point out quite correctly that at the very
top levels the resentment is very muted and hardly visible (see the huge
majorities of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> in elite <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">colleges</ENAMEX> who say diversity is a good thing and
we should have more, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bowen</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bok</ENAMEX> book, The
Shape of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">River</ENAMEX> ). It's the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> educated at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yale</ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lemann</ENAMEX>'s account,
who are the most vigorous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defenders</ENAMEX> of affirmative action in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>. There
is not only <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Molly Munger</ENAMEX> but also <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Lann Lee</ENAMEX>, now the assistant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX>
general in charge of civil rights. The resentment seems to be somewhat greater
at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Texas</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Michigan</ENAMEX>, which are certainly
elite within their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> but fall short of the very top national elite level.
And as you point out, it is the middle <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX>, and I would add, the upper
working <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX>, that seem most resentful, even though the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> of the latter
will go neither to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ivy Leagues</ENAMEX> nor the flagship state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">universities</ENAMEX>. At the
places their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> will go to, racial preference doesn't play much of a
role. Clearly self-interest is not playing the decisive role in the struggle
over affirmative action. I would suggest it is ideology that makes for the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">division</ENAMEX>, and yes, the ideology of the elite is equality, and that of the
middle <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX> is opportunity. There are some oddities here, not the least of
which is that the struggle over affirmative action is waged most vigorously
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX> admissions to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">colleges</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">universities</ENAMEX>, and one hears less and less about
important cases in the area of employment. But it is there, I would think, that
those who voted against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CCRI</ENAMEX> would feel the bite of affirmative action more,
because of its commonness in employment for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">policemen</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">firemen</ENAMEX>, and much other
public employment, and its prominence in the hiring and promotion policies of
big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporations</ENAMEX>.

            In view of the fact that the present system for
selecting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elites</ENAMEX> selects one that is critical of the system, concerned about
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inequality</ENAMEX> and greater opportunity, one wonders why <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lemann</ENAMEX> is complaining. He
writes that the most unfair system of distributing opportunity would be one "in
which all roles were handed down explicitly by inheritance." But then, "the
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> most unfair system ... could well be one that allowed for competition
but insisted that it take place as early in life as possible and with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> as
the arena." His discomfort with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SAT</ENAMEX> is that it's an intelligence test that
primarily selects <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who are good at test-taking and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>. His real
problem is to define a less unfair system.

            As a matter of fact, he is unfair in describing the
present system. It is not totally dependant on the tests. There are the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">athletes</ENAMEX> and the alumni <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and the occasional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> who is very good at
something even though his test scores are not at the top. And, of course, there
is affirmative action in most selective <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX>, and that may be as many
as <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 percent</NUMEX> of all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">colleges</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">universities</ENAMEX>, for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanics</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Indians</ENAMEX>. So it is a meritocratic system considerably modified.

            So what is the problem? <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unfairness</ENAMEX> because of early
selection? Actually, if we made the selection even <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX>, the differences
between the majority and minority <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> would probably be smaller. And by
international standards, we don't make the selection so early. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX> there
used to be (maybe there still is) an <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">11-plus</NUMEX> exam that makes the selection at a
very <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early age</TIMEX>; on the continent, too, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> are divided between secondary
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> that lead to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">university</ENAMEX> and those that do not at an earlier <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age than 17</TIMEX>
or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">18</NUMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Secondly</NUMEX>, there are opportunities here to get into the system later.
There are community <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">colleges</ENAMEX>, from which you can transfer all the way to the
elite campuses of the state university. Few do, but there is the
opportunity.

            Is the problem that the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">arena</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>? Here Lemann
has a stronger point, but no society has been able to figure out a better
arena, even though <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> is not the best place to learn how to become an
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">entrepreneur</ENAMEX> or a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politician</ENAMEX>, run a business or a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, become an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX>,
etc. How the school system became the great selector, even though it selects
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> on the basis of talents that are not directly related to many important
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">social</ENAMEX> roles, is a mystery to me. But it's happened everywhere, in the most
diverse cultures. I recall that even in ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">administrators</ENAMEX> of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">empire</ENAMEX> were selected on the basis of competence in the ancient classics. The
only justification for the present system is that intelligence is useful in any
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">task</ENAMEX>, and that the only fair and systematic way we have of determining
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intelligence</ENAMEX> is by way of a uniform test, poor as that may be. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lemann</ENAMEX>'s task is
to define the alternative.

            At the end of his account of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Molly Munger</ENAMEX>'s fight
against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CCRI</ENAMEX>, and her deflation when after all her efforts it succeeds,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lemann</ENAMEX> tells us that she has left civil-rights work and has started a new
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX> devoted to improving education for the poor. Lemann, while he is
only reporting this, seems to approve. So maybe the only problem, or the main
problem, is not the test, not selection on the basis of verbal and mathematical
competence--which is all the test does--but trying harder to get those who
ordinarily do poorly on such tests to do better. But that opens another can of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worms</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lemann</ENAMEX>'s stab at the enormously difficult problem of improving
education at the lower levels is not too encouraging: "We should adopt the goal
of sending most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> all the way through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">college</ENAMEX> ... To get more people
through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">college</ENAMEX>, we shall have to establish greater national authority over
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">education</ENAMEX>. High <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> should ... [teach] a nationally agreed upon
curriculum." One wonders if he has been following the efforts to create
national standards. Of course, this is only a somewhat tacked-on addendum to
what is on the whole a good book, but it does confront us with the question:
What is the alternative to the present system?

            This has not been much of a debate, I realize. We seem
to agree that whatever its flaws in logic and in practice, we can't think of a
clearly better system. I have the impression, if we had a talk with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lemann</ENAMEX>, he
might agree, and we wouldn't disagree with him when he insisted that the main
thing to do is to improve education. But we would probably disagree over the
specifics as to how one does it.
