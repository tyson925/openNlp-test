            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dear Nora</ENAMEX>:

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Unger</ENAMEX> is the philosopher; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Singer</ENAMEX> is the animal-rights <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> who
wrote the piece in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> 
               Magazine based on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unger</ENAMEX>'s ideas and
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$200-</NUMEX>a-child calculations. And no, I don't think nanny-state leftism is going
to make a big <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> comeback soon, either, at least not absent a depression.
(Although if the Dow market fell to, say, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6,000</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX>, we'd suddenly have
politics that mattered in this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>.) But it does seem telling that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX>' tax-cut talk is getting no real traction among the citizenry now.
And I guess what I mean by a revival of liberalism is more the inevitably
silly-looking but ultimately more-good-than-bad kind of guilty,
upper-middle-class and rich-person liberalism that makes excess <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">impolitic</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">unstylish</ENAMEX>, the way it was before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1982</TIMEX>, and increases the (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
impulse toward philanthropy and generosity. If <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arthur Schlesinger</ENAMEX> is right
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about his 30-year</TIMEX> cycles, it's time.

            Regarding <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ron Perelman</ENAMEX> (and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ron Perelmans</ENAMEX> of the world): At what level
of consciousness do you suppose he knows or cares that if he weren't rich he
wouldn't get to sleep with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Patricia Duff</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ellen Barkin</ENAMEX>? And, even
more coarsely, how tightly do you think the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Patricia Duffs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ellen Barkins</ENAMEX> of
the world have to close their eyes and think of $$$ as they're being ravished
by unattractive billionaires? To use your phrase: just asking. And finally:
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">million-dollar</NUMEX> end tables? <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Million-dollar</NUMEX> end tables? <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Million-dollar</NUMEX>
end tables ? That was the big boggler for me, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Duff</ENAMEX>-and-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Perelman</ENAMEX>-wise.

            Yes (speaking of steely blonde <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> who make <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Faustian</ENAMEX> marital bargains in
the name of love, or "love"), I look forward to discussing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary</ENAMEX> and her
campaign against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rudy Giuliani</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">King Kong</ENAMEX> vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Godzilla</ENAMEX>?) <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX>.

            Your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pal</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kurt</ENAMEX>
