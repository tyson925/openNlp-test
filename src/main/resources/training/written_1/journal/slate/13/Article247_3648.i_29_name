               Judging <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amy</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> drama premiering <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">tonight</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 p.m.</TIMEX>, imitates
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Providence</ENAMEX> , which returns for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">another season</TIMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8 p.m.</TIMEX>,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Providence</ENAMEX> incarnates a new kind of show <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> in hotness only to
those aimed at <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teen-agers</ENAMEX>: the series meant to keep high-spending grown-up
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> from abandoning network television. (Now that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Geraldine Laybourne</ENAMEX> has
started <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxygen</ENAMEX>, a cable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> fear that the hitherto
male world of cable could start stealing their loyal female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewers</ENAMEX>.)  

            Both shows feature leggy professional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">babes</ENAMEX> with big, fabulous tresses (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amy</ENAMEX>
Brenneman of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">NYPD Blue as Amy in Judging Amy</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Melina Kanakaredes</ENAMEX>
as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Syd Hansen</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Providence</ENAMEX> ) who have thrown over high-powered careers
(corporate law for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amy</ENAMEX>, plastic surgery for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syd</ENAMEX>) in fast-paced <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">York</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>) for noble, self-sacrificing careers (family court <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX>,
family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX>) in depressed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Northeastern</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hartford</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Providence</ENAMEX>), where
they both move in with their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">divorcing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amy</ENAMEX> is marginally more
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">believable</ENAMEX> as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> whose life has taken a scary new turn than the
unflappable single <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Syd</ENAMEX> ever was--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amy</ENAMEX> gets flustered; she doesn't know what to
wear; her clothes don't seem designed to show off an improbably sculpted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>,
as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syd</ENAMEX>'s do; she has no pat reasons for having left her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>; her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mom</ENAMEX>,
played by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tyne Daly</ENAMEX>, is pitch-perfect as the smart, confident older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> who
quashes her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> (she's a more compelling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syd</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>, a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wan veterinarian</ENAMEX> who can do no wrong); and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amy</ENAMEX>'s own <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX>--well, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amy</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> is unbearable, a stereotypical know-it-all TV <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tyke</ENAMEX>. Overall, though,
both shows are riffs on the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Tyler Moore</ENAMEX> theme, which after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> has become the key slogan of TV feminism: They're going to make it after
all.

             The difference between <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Richards</ENAMEX> and these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>, of course, is that she
was striking out on her own, and they, having done so, are coming home. Is this
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TV</ENAMEX>'s blow against feminism? If we see the shows in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Tyler Moore</ENAMEX>-era
feminist perspective, the answer would probably be yes. Something has
definitely gone wrong with their ambitions to become successful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX>.
But the twist is that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syd</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amy</ENAMEX>'s problems don't have much to do with their
being female. Their issue is, they don't like their jobs. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syd</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amy</ENAMEX> don't go
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> to become homemakers or marry high-school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sweethearts</ENAMEX>. They go home
because they choose occupations that mean more to them--in which, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amy</ENAMEX> says
in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">tonight</TIMEX>'s episode of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Judging Amy</ENAMEX> , they get to "make a
difference"--but pay less. (There are secondary reasons: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syd</ENAMEX> wants to take care
of her widowed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amy</ENAMEX> wants to get away from life with her ex-husband.)
Both have long been the achievers in their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>. Both have trod a well-worn
meritocratic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">path</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A's</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> to top-flight <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">colleges</ENAMEX> to well-paying
professions--without really knowing what they wanted to be once they got to
wherever they were going. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amy</ENAMEX> feels she's been on autopilot: Whenever an
opportunity presented itself, she says, "I had to do it. I couldn't fail. I
don't fail well."

            But their compulsion to suceed and their advanced degrees do them little
good when it comes to getting along with regular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, a skill they must and
eventually do <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">master</ENAMEX>. (Actually, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Syd</ENAMEX> gets it instinctively, another way in
which she's smugly annoying.) When they grow, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> in television
dramas must, it is by learning that their former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">positions</ENAMEX> in the upper-middle
classes don't give them any particular edge over the common folk they find
themselves among. In short, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amy</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syd</ENAMEX> are TV populists, not TV
anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">feminists</ENAMEX>. They could be <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jimmy Stewart</ENAMEX> at the end of It's a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Wonderful</ENAMEX>
Life , or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> preparing to run for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>, or even, perhaps, the
fantasy projections of self-pitying network <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> who wish they could
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">chuck</ENAMEX> the lunches at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Dome</ENAMEX> and the whole rat race and just go home again.
That the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> is more a reflection of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX>'s
demographic needs at the moment than of anything else. Their sex is incidental
to the theme--which in a perverse sort of way may make these the most feminist
series on television <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>.
