            Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">advertisers</ENAMEX> have tried all kinds of tactics to attract
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX>, and more recently those tactics have seemed to cover the full
spectrum of the possible, including the utterly oblique (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Infiniti</ENAMEX>'s first
campaign), the willfully tacky (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mentos</ENAMEX>), the memorable-for-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">memorability</ENAMEX>'s-sake
(<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Outpost</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX>'s flying gerbils and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ravenous wolves</ENAMEX>), and the self-loathing
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sega</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> ads for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dreamcast</ENAMEX>, which I wrote about here 
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX>). But in one of its new ads, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Airways</ENAMEX>, of all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>,
seems to be pioneering a still relatively uncharted strategy: mocking its own
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX>, and its most lucrative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> at that.

            The ad is set in an elementary<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">-school</ENAMEX> (or whatever the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> call
elementary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">classroom</ENAMEX>, where the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> are engaged in a furious game of
<ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">musical chairs</ENAMEX>. Its basic premise is that certain kinds of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> end up doing
certain kinds of jobs when they grow up, which is certainly an unsurprising
enough premise. And for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the first 20 seconds</TIMEX> or so of the ad, as different
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> find seats in different ways and thereby demonstrate their eventual
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fates</ENAMEX> (as the camera zooms in on the individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>, their eventual
professions appear on screen), the ad, too, is unsurprising.

            Then a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX>--with curly hair and glasses, I think, though I've seen the ad
only a couple of times--realizes that he's been frozen out, that all the seats
have been taken and he's lost. His response is to throw a tantrum, and he
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stomps</ENAMEX> around, complaining--presumably at the top of his lungs, though the ad
is silent except for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">announcer</ENAMEX>'s voice-over--at this unjust turn of events.
And on-screen appears the word, "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">CEO</ENAMEX>."

            The camera pans down the occupied seats, to alight upon a fresh-scrubbed
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">lass</ENAMEX>, who stands up and lets the peevish <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> sit down, much to his
self-satisfied delight. The ad closes with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> in the foreground, smiling
at the camera, because she is, of course, the perfect future <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Airways</ENAMEX>
flight <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attendant</ENAMEX>.

            The "our flight <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attendants</ENAMEX> are generous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">souls</ENAMEX> who will sacrifice anything
for the pleasure and comfort of their charges" message is not odd here. But the
"<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">CEOs</ENAMEX> are spoiled <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> whose main talent consists of yelling and screaming
until they get what they want, even at the cost of others' well-being" is
strange, particularly since all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> in the game who have got seats
appear to have got them by dint of hard work and/or sharp tactics. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">CEO</ENAMEX> has
failed because he's not very good, and succeeds only by crying. The only way
the ad could have painted a less savory picture of corporate chieftains would
have been if the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> had forced one of the other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> to stand up. But
then that would have defeated the whole "flight <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attendants</ENAMEX> are angels" part of
the ad.

            What's especially interesting about this is that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Airways</ENAMEX> is in the
midst of a well-publicized slimming down (figurative and literal, since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BA</ENAMEX> is
going to be flying smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planes</ENAMEX>) that's designed to make high-end <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> a
larger percentage of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">airline</ENAMEX>'s business. This ad, with its faintly populist
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">air</ENAMEX>, doesn't seem to fit the new strategy all that well. But who knows? Maybe
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BA</ENAMEX> has figured out that what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">CEOs</ENAMEX> really want is for someone to see them as
they truly are and then say, "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hey</ENAMEX>, it's OK." After all, in the end the spoiled
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">kid</ENAMEX> does get the chair and a smile from the pretty <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX>.
