             The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> issue of
Talk <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tina Brown</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harvey</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Weinstein</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cathleen</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Black</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wagnerian</ENAMEX> exercise in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gesamtkunst</ENAMEX> synergy, has been on newsstands
for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a week</TIMEX> now. Did you know that? Did anyone? Isn't even silence about
Talk newsworthy? This strangely underhyped event might have passed
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">unnoticed</ENAMEX> had not the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ever-vigilant</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mickey Kaus</ENAMEX> of kausfiles.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">com</ENAMEX> invented a game: Count the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Miramax</ENAMEX> plugs
in the new issue! (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kausfiles</ENAMEX> came up with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>, which seems low. Note to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mickey</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnny Depp</ENAMEX> hasn't got a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Miramax</ENAMEX> movie coming out right at this very
moment, but with those tattoos and all, he's got a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Miramax</ENAMEX> feel to him.
If it isn't branding, it's co-branding.)

            The hypesters have wearied of the hype, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Culturebox</ENAMEX> is ready to
Talk . Having worked on a few <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> startups in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">her day</TIMEX>, she had felt
it rude to comment until issue <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">No. 2</NUMEX> came out. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX> issues are like
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">out-of-town</ENAMEX> opening <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">nights</TIMEX>. No one knows how to do their job yet, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> flub
their lines, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> have nervous breakdowns. But <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a month</TIMEX> has passed, and now a
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week</TIMEX>. Herewith, a few remarks.

            <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX> question: What kind of magazine is it? <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX> answer: A beautiful <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>.
Talk <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> whose visual conception is so tight that
even the bar code is a design element. You pick the thing up and it demands to
be flipped through. It doesn't demand to be read with the same urgency, though.
The editorial vision is a lot looser. This is probably deliberate--after all,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> is supposed to be chatty--but chatty doesn't have to mean a lack
of rigor. The following tier of headlines, "Cultural Concierge/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Land</ENAMEX> of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pharoahs/Art</ENAMEX> in the age of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pyramids</ENAMEX>," communicates no sense of what this
piece is actually about or why I need to read it now, as opposed to several
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thousand years ago</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chatty</ENAMEX> doesn't have to mean <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> should be allowed to
make fools of themselves through excessive preening. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Three-and-a-half</ENAMEX> pages on
how humiliated a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> with professional credentials was when her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>
discovered that she liked to keep <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX>? <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> food <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nigella Lawson</ENAMEX> on
how unbearably sophisticated her and her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>' palates have become?

            
If you try to flip away from the self-congratulation, you come across the
synergy. Don't get me wrong. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Synergy</ENAMEX>'s only a problem if it causes <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> to
pick boring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>, or boring approaches to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>. An
intelligently-written assessment of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">60 Minutes</ENAMEX> correspondent <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wallace</ENAMEX> still manages only to reproduce general criticisms leveled at him with
more specificity in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Mann</ENAMEX>'s new movie. Note to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tina</ENAMEX>: Consider how fat a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">target Wallace</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">60 Minutes</ENAMEX> could be, if an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> ever wanted to pay
someone to reinvestigate a few of their pieces.
 Then consider that this represents another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Disney</ENAMEX> tie-in. The movie,
The Insider , which is about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX>'s suppression of a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">60 Minutes</ENAMEX>
interview with a tobacco-industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whistleblower</ENAMEX>, is being released by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Miramax</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister company</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Touchstone</ENAMEX>. Try to decide whether this would look  like you
were sucking up to your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bosses</ENAMEX> too much or not enough. Then skip the whole
thing.

            But so what if Talk fails to grip our attention? We really like
handling it. Rolling it up and sticking it in our bag, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tina Brown</ENAMEX> had
suggested we do. Pulling it out on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">subway</ENAMEX> and mooning over the unbelievably
gorgeous ads. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end</TIMEX>, we decided it was our approach that was wrong, not
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX>. Talk is a fashion book, not a general-interest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX>.
Talk , like talk, is meant to be consumed in bursts--style bursts (style
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Morris</ENAMEX> on why <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amtrak</ENAMEX> uniforms are so fashionable),
intellectual-style bursts (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skip Gates</ENAMEX> on why race is now a fiction), hairstyle
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bursts</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barney</ENAMEX>'s window-dresser <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simon Doonan</ENAMEX> on why rock <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">star</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Bolton</ENAMEX>
should revert to his bad hair of yesteryear).

            Our <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> question: What is Talk really about? By issue <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">No. 2</NUMEX>, we
decided that there definitely was a message. Consider the profiles (the
preferred genre of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX>): <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elizabeth Taylor</ENAMEX>, in a delightfully bizarre
piece by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Theroux</ENAMEX> that finally conveys just how weird the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> is, saying,
"I've had some things happen in my life that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> wouldn't believe." <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnny</ENAMEX>
Depp, who cuts himself whenever those kinds of things happen to him. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Judah</ENAMEX>
Folkman, the biomedical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researcher</ENAMEX> who landed on the cover of the New York
Times for having discovered the cure for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>, then found himself
ostracized by his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> because he hadn't, really, though he never claimed
he had. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alec Guinness</ENAMEX> on how he hates having become famous for his worst role,
which was as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Obi-Wan Kenobi</ENAMEX>.

            The message is, fame sucks. It really, really makes <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">celebrities</ENAMEX> suffer. I'm
down with that. I believe it to be true. Think of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diana</ENAMEX> and the
paparazzi , and all the bad stuff that's happened to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, such as
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clintons</ENAMEX>, because of the tabloids and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tabloid</ENAMEX> mentality of even the
legitimate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">press</ENAMEX>. So: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rein</ENAMEX> in the press! Rally round the cause! It's a movement
for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the millennium</TIMEX>! <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hey</ENAMEX>, did you hear? There's going to be a screening of the
movie version of Talk (by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miramax</ENAMEX>, of course) to benefit a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Celebrities</ENAMEX>'
Rights Campaign! <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sean Penn</ENAMEX> will be there! Wanna go?
