            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alex Kuczynski</ENAMEX> of the New York
Times raked <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger C. Altman</ENAMEX> over the coals <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> for
becoming a tabloid <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tycoon</ENAMEX>. It's about time somebody did. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger Altman</ENAMEX> is not to be confused with the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Altmans</ENAMEX> who, are, respectively, a celebrated film <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX>,
a former law <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clark Clifford</ENAMEX>, and a former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rolling Stone</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">photographer</ENAMEX> who took these compelling shots of hippies during the 1960s
(counterintuitively, it is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> who is
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">married to Lynda "Wonder Woman</ENAMEX>" <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carter</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Altman</ENAMEX> is a former deputy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">treasury secretary</ENAMEX> and continuing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> intimate
whose investment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Evercore Partners</ENAMEX>, owns <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Media</ENAMEX>, which in turn owns the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Enquirer</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Star</ENAMEX> , and--most appalling of all,
because it is so clearly the most nutty <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tabloid</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>--the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Weekly World News</ENAMEX> .

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Faithful readers</ENAMEX> of this column may recall that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chatterbox</ENAMEX> has been tracking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Altman</ENAMEX>'s new career as a sleaze-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peddler</ENAMEX> (see
"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Man Bites Dog</ENAMEX>" and "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">It's the End of the World</ENAMEX>, But Don't Panic"), with an
eye to finding out whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Altman</ENAMEX> would attempt to make his new media holdings
more pro-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> or more respectable. Chatterbox naively assumed that if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Altman</ENAMEX>
didn't make his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tabloids</ENAMEX> more pro-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>, he would be frozen out by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clintons</ENAMEX>, and that if he didn't make his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tabloids</ENAMEX> more respectable, he would be
frozen out by respectable society.

            But according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> ,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Evercore</ENAMEX>'s purchase of three cheesy supermarket <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tabloids</ENAMEX> didn't prevent <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> from attending a dinner at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Altman</ENAMEX>'s home on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Upper East Side</ENAMEX> in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX>. Since then, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Enquirer</ENAMEX> has run a
piece alleging that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary</ENAMEX> has committed
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adultery</ENAMEX> (with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vince Foster</ENAMEX> and an unnamed "longtime <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX>") while serving as
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chatterbox</ENAMEX> (who has no opinion about whether these rumors are true,
but wouldn't blame Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> if they were) doesn't see how <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary Clinton</ENAMEX>
can dine with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger Altman</ENAMEX> ever again; if she does, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chatterbox</ENAMEX> will be forced
to conclude that she lacks even the small quantity of self-respect required to
serve in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Senate</ENAMEX>.

            Chatterbox was clearly an idiot to think that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Evercore</ENAMEX>'s ownership of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Weekly World News</ENAMEX> could
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">deny Altman</ENAMEX> a prominent role on Wall Street. The peg to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kuczynski</ENAMEX>'s article was
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Altman</ENAMEX>'s apparently major role in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viacom</ENAMEX> deal, on which "Evercore
earned <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">an estimated $10 million</NUMEX> fee as the principal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adviser</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX>," and with
which "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Altman</ENAMEX> sealed his growing reputation as a politically connected player
on the media merger scene." Of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Altman</ENAMEX>'s new dominance in the
supermarket-tabloid biz, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goldman Sachs</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Hormats</ENAMEX> told the
Times , rather charitably, "I do not think it is
widely known at all in this world."

            The most intriguing thing in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuczynski</ENAMEX>'s piece is
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Altman</ENAMEX>'s own ambiguous stance about his stewardship of the supermarket
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">tabloids:</ENAMEX>

            

               
                  We think <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Media</ENAMEX> is a
good investment, plain and simple. We are not sitting there working on each
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week</TIMEX>'s copy. We are not involved in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekly</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</TIMEX> or, for that matter,
any editorial decision of any kind. I think if you went around and asked any
number of reasonably well-established buyout <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX>, they approach it the same
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX>. It is <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>'s job to manage the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>. We are financial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX>, and
we do not manage the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> .

            

            On the most superficial level, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Altman</ENAMEX> appears to be
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">signaling</ENAMEX>, "Please don't be mad at me, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary</ENAMEX>," and also, perhaps, "Please,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brooke Astor</ENAMEX>, don't shut me out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">charity</ENAMEX>-ball circuit." On a deeper
level, though, it's hard to tell whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Altman</ENAMEX> means to communicate, "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hey</ENAMEX>, I'm
just the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pimp</ENAMEX>, I don't turn the tricks," or whether he's casting himself,
absurdly, as some magnificently disinterested <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sulzberger</ENAMEX>- or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Graham</ENAMEX>-esque
figure who refuses to compromise editorial integrity. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Media</ENAMEX>'s chief
executive, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Pecker</ENAMEX>, seems to hew to the latter interpretation, because he
told the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Altman</ENAMEX> has done nothing to
interfere with the "hard-hitting" stuff in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enquirer</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Star</ENAMEX> about the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clintons</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pecker</ENAMEX> might also have noted that the editorial
integrity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Weekly World News</ENAMEX> remains largely
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unmolested</ENAMEX> (though <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chatterbox</ENAMEX> did point out, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX>, a bizarre feint in the
direction of respectability in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Weekly World</ENAMEX>
News' coverage of the imminent apocalypse). This
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week</TIMEX>'s issue includes headlines such as "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Your Family May Be Living Under a</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Curse ... And Not Even Know It</ENAMEX>!" and "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Cement Mixer Rips Man's Penis Off</ENAMEX>!" and
"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Last Living Neanderthal Family Found In Icelandic Cave</ENAMEX>!"

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Altman</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Evercore</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Austin Beutner</ENAMEX>, told the
Times ,

            

               
                  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Media</ENAMEX> reaches an
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each week</TIMEX>. We think the ability to deliver
interesting content to that large an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX>, and deliver that large an
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">advertisers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers of commerce</ENAMEX>--whether through
direct-response marketing or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E-</ENAMEX>commerce--is compelling. And we think the scale
of that business can grow many-fold over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next several years</TIMEX> .

            

            Translation: "This is a dream advertising market,
because practically by definition these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> will
believe anything !"
