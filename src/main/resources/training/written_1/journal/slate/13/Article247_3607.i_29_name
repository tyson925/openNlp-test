            Literature does not good policy make, as some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poet</ENAMEX> somewhere must have said.
Consider <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank McCourt</ENAMEX>, who has become a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> for the now-controversial
view that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> should have more leeway in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">classroom</ENAMEX>, not less. McCourt
is the pixie-faced, white-haired, thick-brogued <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">raconteur</ENAMEX> who wrote <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Angela</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ashes</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bildungsroman</ENAMEX> explaining how the bitterly poor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> of an
embittered drunk from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Limerick</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ireland</ENAMEX>, became the kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who could write
a witty, heartbreaking memoir about being the bitterly poor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> of an
embittered drunk, etc. He's also the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> of 'Tis --the sequel, in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bookstores</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this month</TIMEX> (click here to order the book). In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">'Tis</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Angela</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ashes</ENAMEX> comes to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>, finagles his way into college despite
his lack of a high-school education, and turns himself into a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York City</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">schoolteacher</ENAMEX>.

            Having sold <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 4 million</NUMEX> copies of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Angela</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Ashes</ENAMEX> in more than
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> languages, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McCourt</ENAMEX> is not only the most beloved <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> and maybe
the world but also the most widely-read education <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX> too. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Journalists</ENAMEX> call
him up for his opinions on vouchers (he's against them) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> unions
(he's for them, but thinks they're too bureaucratic). But his philosophy is
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">plainest</ENAMEX> to see in his books. For the growing numbers of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> advocating
draconian "drill and practice" routines in which a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX>'s every gesture and
word is preprogrammed, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Angela</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Ashes</ENAMEX> offers a scene in which one of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McCourt</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Irish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> shocks him into paying attention by having an opinion
on things. ("<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">He</ENAMEX> tells us what is important and why. No <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">master</ENAMEX> ever told us why
before. If you asked why you'd be hit on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX>.") Standardized tests are
dispatched wittily in a scene in 'Tis in which an "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Academic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX>"
reels off a list of what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCourt</ENAMEX>, as a neophyte <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX>, must do with a class
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">full</TIMEX> of angry, ignorant, rebellious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teen-agers</ENAMEX>:

            
               
                  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> says there will be midterm exams in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks</TIMEX>
and my teaching should focus on areas that will be covered in exams. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Students</ENAMEX>
in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> should have mastered spelling and vocabulary lists, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one hundred</NUMEX> of
each which they are supposed to have in their notebooks and if they don't
points off, and be prepared to write essays on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> novels. Economic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Citizenship</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> should be more than halfway through Your <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World</ENAMEX> and
You.
                  
               
            

            Since the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> have studied neither spelling nor vocabulary and never 
cracked their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Economic Citizenship</ENAMEX> textbook, the advice could not have been
more malapropos. Teaching eventually becomes easier but even more mindless:

            

               
                  I followed the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> guides. I launched the prefabricated
questions at my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX>. I hit them with surprise <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">quizzes</ENAMEX> and tests and
destroyed them with the ponderous detailed examinations concocted by college
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professors</ENAMEX> who assemble high school textbooks.
               

               
                  My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> resisted and cheated and disliked me and I disliked them
for disliking me.
               

            

            Finally, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McCourt</ENAMEX> throws the whole damn curriculum in the trash:

            

               
                  I couldn't let days dribble by in the routine of high school
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">grammar</ENAMEX>, spelling, vocabulary, digging for the deeper meaning in poetry, bits
of literature doled out for the multiple choice tests that would follow so that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">universities</ENAMEX> can be supplied with the best and the brightest. I had to begin to
enjoy the act of teaching and the only way I could do that was start over,
teach what I loved and to hell with the curriculum.
               

            

            Now here's a truly humane theory of education: The more fully realized the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> is, intellectually and personally, the better able he will be to
communicate his passion for ideas and learning to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX>. Conversely, the
more uniform the curriculum and teaching method, the more soul-destroying they
are for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> alike.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank McCourt</ENAMEX> brims with intelligence and charisma (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Culturebox</ENAMEX> has seen him
speak) and must have been an unforgettable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> whatever he did. But could
other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> follow his example? <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McCourt</ENAMEX>'s own story indicates that they
could not. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ireland</ENAMEX>, compassionate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> would seem to be painfully rare.
McCourt learns to love literature more in spite of his schooling than because
of it, as a result of the ministrations of a kind <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">librarian</ENAMEX> and a fellow
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> to which he is briefly confined. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>, his
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> are mostly defeated (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miss Mudd</ENAMEX>, his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">predecessor</ENAMEX> on his <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> job,
has retired early in disgust) when they aren't sadistic. Considering how hard
it was for the extraordinary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank McCourt</ENAMEX> to learn how to teach, one has to
wonder whether  individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> can really measure their own progress. That
teaching, done right, requires all of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX>'s emotional and intellectual
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX>; that we accord <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> neither the respect nor the pay they need to
function well in their jobs; that few public school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> come close to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ideal</ENAMEX> or leave the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> with anything like what they need to get by--all
this seems like a good argument for better pay scales and reform in the
educational system that produces <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX>. But in the absence of a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> of
McCourts, it is also a  reason to insist on greater teacher oversight and
accountability and less freedom to do as they please.
