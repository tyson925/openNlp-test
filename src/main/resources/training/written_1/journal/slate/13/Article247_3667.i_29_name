            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> ran a surprising news article <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Broder</ENAMEX> reporting that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Friends of the Earth</ENAMEX>'s political action <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committee</ENAMEX> would endorse <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Bradley</ENAMEX>
for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>. The surprising news wasn't that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Friends of the Earth</ENAMEX> was dissing
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX>--as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Broder</ENAMEX>'s article explained, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Friends of the Earth</ENAMEX> is both somewhat smaller than and
somewhat to the left of most other national environmental <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, which are
still expected to endorse the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX>. No, what was surprising was that
in the course of justifying this bit of interest<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">-group</ENAMEX> entrepreneurship, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Friends of the Earth</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">PAC</ENAMEX> was able to state that, looking at both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX>'
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX> had a significantly more pro-green voting record
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">than Gore</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Broder</ENAMEX> article (or, more likely, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Friends of the Earth</ENAMEX>
handout that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Broder</ENAMEX> was paraphrasing) slightly botched the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX>'
respective <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scores</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">League of Conservation Voters</ENAMEX> (LCV)--whose ratings go pretty much
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unquestioned</ENAMEX> within the environmental movement. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Broder</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX> scored <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">85</NUMEX>
percent to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">66 percent</NUMEX>, when in fact <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX> scored <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">84 percent</NUMEX> to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">64 percent</NUMEX> . But the claim that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX> had a much better LCV score
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">than Gore</ENAMEX> is quite true. Indeed, since the gap is reall y 
               20
percentage points (rather than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> points), it's a little truer
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">than Broder</ENAMEX> said.*

            In the great scheme of things, of course, both <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> have
sufficiently high LCV ratings that one really shouldn't call into question
either <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX>'s commitment to environmental protection. Still, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> is
someone who once wrote (in his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX> book <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Balance</ENAMEX> ) that "we must make the rescue
of the environment the central organizing principle for civilization." By
contrast, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX> is someone who once wrote (in his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> book <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Time Present</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> Past ) that "the environmental
movement brought a vast improvement in the quality of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Jersey</ENAMEX>'s ecology."
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX> is much better known for his interest in tax reform and racial healing
(and, of course, <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">basketball</ENAMEX>) than for any interest in conservation. How can it
be that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX>'s environmental voting record is so much better than
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX>'s?

            Perhaps, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chatterbox</ENAMEX> thought, there was something unfair about the LCV
calculations. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Examining Gore</ENAMEX>'s and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LCV</ENAMEX> scorecards (which, sadly,
aren't available on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Web</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chatterbox</ENAMEX> noticed that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> was being judged
partly on votes that occurred during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the two years</TIMEX> before <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX> came to
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>--and, in one of those <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1978</TIMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> earned his third-worst
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> LCV score ever (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">56 percent</NUMEX>). Mightn't <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX> have cast a few
anti-environmental votes if he'd been around during those <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</TIMEX>? So
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chatterbox</ENAMEX> knocked out <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1977 and 1978</TIMEX> and recalculated <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX>'s lifetime
LCV score. That brought <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> 
               up from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">64 percent</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">65</NUMEX>
percent . Then <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chatterbox recalculated Bradley</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">lifetime</TIMEX> LCV score by
knocking out <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993 through 1996</TIMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX> retired, since this was a
period when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> wasn't around to vote (except, of course, on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX>
tie-breakers, but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LCV</ENAMEX> doesn't count those). This left <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">84</NUMEX>
percent , with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore-Bradley</ENAMEX> gap narrowed from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 to 19</NUMEX>
percentage points.

            Then <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chatterbox</ENAMEX> noticed that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> had missed a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> LCV-scored
environmental votes during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">his years</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>, while <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX> has missed only
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Nine</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX>'s absences occurred during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1987-8 and 1992</TIMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> was
quite understandably occupied by running for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX>,
respectively. So <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chatterbox</ENAMEX> knocked those <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> out of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX>'s LCV lifetime
score, too. That brought <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> 
               up from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">65 percent</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">66</NUMEX>
percent . But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chatterbox</ENAMEX> had to do the same thing for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX>. That brought
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX> 
               up from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">84 percent to 85 percent</NUMEX> , leaving
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore-Bradley</ENAMEX> gap stuck at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> percentage points.

            Maybe, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chatterbox</ENAMEX> thought, the only fair comparison was for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years 1985</TIMEX>
through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX> served together in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX>: same
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chamber</ENAMEX>, same votes, no room for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">apples</ENAMEX>-and-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oranges mismatches</ENAMEX>. That brought
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> from his raw score of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">64 percent up to 73 percent</NUMEX> ,
but it also brought <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bradley</ENAMEX> up from his raw score of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">84 percent</NUMEX>
to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">86</NUMEX> 
               percent , leaving a stubborn gap of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> percentage
points in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX>'s favor. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chatterbox</ENAMEX> narrowed this gap to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX>
percentage points by eliminating <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1987-8 and 1992</TIMEX> from both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> scores
(again, because <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> had absences presumably related to the presidential
races): <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> shot up to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">82 percent</NUMEX> , while <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX> inched
up to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90 percent</NUMEX> .

            Conclusion: No matter how hard you try to give <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> a break, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX> has the
greener congressional voting record. An examination of the particular votes
that cost <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> this contest will follow.

            * <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pedant's Corner</ENAMEX> : the erroneous <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">85 to 66 percent</NUMEX> calculations were
almost certainly arrived at by averaging the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yearly</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LCV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scores</ENAMEX>; but LCV
calculates a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">legislator</ENAMEX>'s lifetime score by adding up all his
pro-environment votes and dividing that number by the total number of
LCV-scored votes that took place while he was in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>. Because of a typo on
the LCV scorecard for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chatterbox</ENAMEX> momentarily thought <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> had been
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rooked</ENAMEX>; dividing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">lifetime</TIMEX> total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">172</NUMEX> pro-environment votes by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">214</NUMEX>,
which the scorecard presents as the total number of LCV-scored votes that took
place during <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chatterbox</ENAMEX> got not <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">84 percent</NUMEX>
but <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80 percent</NUMEX> . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chatterbox</ENAMEX> then added up all the numbers in that column
and realized that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">214</NUMEX> total was erroneous ; the real total was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">204</NUMEX>,
hence <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">84 percent</NUMEX> lifetime score was correct . But
because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chatterbox</ENAMEX> had already done the calculations that comprise much of this
item, he had to go back and redo several of them based on the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">204</NUMEX> total. This
was extremely annoying.
