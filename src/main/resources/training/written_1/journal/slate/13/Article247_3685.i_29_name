            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dear George</ENAMEX>,

            I was hoping to start our correspondence a little
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier this</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX>, but the schedule of a working <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mom</ENAMEX> is not always
predictable. My <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> are home from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> holiday of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sukkoth</ENAMEX>. It's one of those <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">holidays</TIMEX> that is great for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> and a bit
difficult for the grown-ups. It's a celebration of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fall</TIMEX> harvest and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>'s life in the desert while they waited to receive the torah. A
significant part of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the holiday</TIMEX> is constructing the "sukkah," a temporary hut
with a natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wood</ENAMEX> roof that lets in the moonlight (and the rain). Eating in
the sukkah in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manhattan</ENAMEX> is quite a feat of religious observance. Not only do
you have to find open space to construct the sukkah, but overzealous neighbors
have been known to report these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Building Department</ENAMEX>, whose
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inspectors</ENAMEX> are often all too happy to cite <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> for code violations. So
much for New York the great liberal <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>!? Which brings me right to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</TIMEX>'s
great religious and civil-liberties controversy. How's that for a surprising
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">segue</ENAMEX>. Have you followed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mayor</ENAMEX>'s latest foray into questions of
public funding for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX>, freedom of speech, the artistic imagination, the
role of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief executive</ENAMEX> as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arbiter</ENAMEX> of good taste, and of course
electoral politics? There are so many lessons about urban politics in this
latest <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giuliani</ENAMEX> outrage/<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> lecture that I couldn't resist bringing it into
our conversation. Calling the Sensation exhibit at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brooklyn Museum</ENAMEX> "sick
stuff" and threatening to cut off its <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> subsidy did not surprise anyone
who's been living with this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mayor</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past six years</TIMEX>. An amazing column in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Post</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gersh Kurtzman</ENAMEX> echoes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jodi</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kantor</ENAMEX>'s piece in 
                  Slate
               
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kurtzman</ENAMEX>'s "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">No Shortage of Filth To Rile Righteous Rudy</ENAMEX>" points to
exhibits at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whitney</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MoMA</ENAMEX> that are certainly equally if not more
offensive than the exhibit at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brooklyn Museum</ENAMEX>. While the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mayor</ENAMEX> may find the
"dung and the virgin" exhibit offensive, as I would, it's an easy target to
score points with upstate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conservatives</ENAMEX> in his not yet announced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX>
campaign. So much for responsible public policy. He hasn't said, let's bring
the funding issue to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">City Council</ENAMEX>, which shares authority over the budget
allocation. He would rather be out there defending decency. Never mind
everything else he's tolerated in this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> when he considers it an economic
development tool. I think we are reaching new levels of cynicism in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">City</ENAMEX> politics, which can only further alienate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> from civic
engagement.

            I know that there is an important relationship between
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">celebrating Sukkoth</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brooklyn Museum Exhibit</ENAMEX>. I just haven't
had time to get to it. I really look forward to your reply.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Warmest</ENAMEX> regards,
Ester
