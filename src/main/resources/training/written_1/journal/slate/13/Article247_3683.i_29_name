            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Angeles Times</ENAMEX> leads with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concerns</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> foreign affairs experts
(mostly outside of, but some in, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>) that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>
might form an anti-U.S. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">alliance</ENAMEX> (the story also uses the more loaded word
"axis"). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> goes
with the serious shortage of military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recruits</ENAMEX> and what the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> is trying
to do about it. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA Today</ENAMEX> goes with a federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">commission</ENAMEX>'s proposal today
of a dramatic exception to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> criminal appeals process: permitting
convicts to file appeals based on DNA evidence even if deadlines for appeals in
general have already expired. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> leads with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan Quayle</ENAMEX>'s likely announcement
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> that he will drop out of the presidential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">race</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> misstep in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX>'s sum-up of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quayle</ENAMEX>'s career: It cites his <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Murphy Brown</ENAMEX> speech about
out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">wedlock</NUMEX> births as an embarrassing incident on a par with the potato
spelling episode. A fairer statement is that the speech helped make the topic a
serious part of the national conversation. Aside from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quayle</ENAMEX>--played bottom
front by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAT</ENAMEX> --none of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX>' leads are fronted elsewhere.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> lead says that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>-spearheaded intervention in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kosovo</ENAMEX>
seems to have accelerated a collaboration between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>,
which together, the paper notes, represent a vast nuclear stockpile and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">billion people</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the most alarming signs of the trend: increasing arm
sales by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">the other two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> says that of all the service <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branches</ENAMEX>, only the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marine Corps</ENAMEX>
is taking in as many new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recruits</ENAMEX> as planned. Some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX>'s countermeasures
include: paying recruits <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$6,000</NUMEX> just for signing up; increasing college money
available to enlistees from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$40,000 to $50,000</NUMEX>; and using brand new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX> as
recruiters, a job formerly reserved for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> with a real service tour
behind them. The story describes how a major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> response has been to
revamp recruitment advertising, so that even "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Be All You Can Be"</ENAMEX>--considered to
be one of the most successful ad campaigns of all time--is likely to be junked.
And it cites the shrinking pool of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18-to-22-year-olds</TIMEX> and the booming economy
as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> causes of the problem. The aforementioned anomalous success of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marine Corps</ENAMEX> suggests a politically sensitive cause that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX>
doesn't mention: the feminization of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">military</ENAMEX> hasn't made it that much more
appealing to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> but has made it much less special-seeming to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">USAT</ENAMEX> explains that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Janet Reno</ENAMEX> is expected to use the DNA
recommendation to promote changes in state laws and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> rules. The paper
notes that since its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</TIMEX> introduction into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX>, DNA evidence has been
used to exonerate 62 wrongfully convicted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> (no <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>?).

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> runs a "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Rule of Law"</ENAMEX> column that weighs
in effectively on an unpublicized <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hawaii</ENAMEX> case about to be argued before the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX>. Seems there's something there called the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office of Hawaiian</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affairs</ENAMEX>, which gives out money to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hawaiians of Polynesian</ENAMEX> origin, and to no one
else. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OHA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> is likewise exclusively populated by these
"native" <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hawaiians</ENAMEX>. And "native" here doesn't mean "born and raised in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hawaii</ENAMEX>."
Hence the lawsuit, in which a lifelong <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hawaiian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">native</ENAMEX> who happens also to be
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">white</ENAMEX> is suing for his piece of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pie</ENAMEX>. The interesting thing is that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinton Justice Department</ENAMEX> has weighed in on the side of the status quo <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hawaii</ENAMEX>
rules, on the grounds that "native" <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hawaiians</ENAMEX> are "indigenous" <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, just
like <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Native Americans</ENAMEX>. The problem with this, the column points out, is that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">native Hawaiians</ENAMEX>, unlike <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Native Americans</ENAMEX>, don't have their own system of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">governance</ENAMEX>, don't live on recognized reservations, and don't have treaties with
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>. If they were to be granted special rights, then why not do the
same for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African-Americans</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Croatian</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>? The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOJ</ENAMEX> position, argues the
piece, is fiercely <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrant</ENAMEX>.

            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> reported in its "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX>" column that
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> has decided to ban tobacco ads after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Oct. 1</TIMEX>. After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Jan. 1</TIMEX>, the ban
will even extend to externally controlled inserts such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parade</ENAMEX>
magazine. With many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX> (including the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> ) already on this
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bandwagon</ENAMEX>, how about turning up the heat on another type of advertising that
probably cuts as wide a swath through <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>--sports handicapping
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">services</ENAMEX>? Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAT</ENAMEX> sports section features <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> ads for
such services, which obviously promote (mostly illegal) gambling.
