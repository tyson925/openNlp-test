            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dear Witold</ENAMEX>,

            I hear what you're saying about being skeptical while also taking
Celebration seriously. I've tried to do the same in writing about the place,
for while I think <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Celebration</ENAMEX> is a flawed experiment with insidious
implications, I also think that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Disney</ENAMEX> was adventurous to try it, and that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architects</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planners</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Disney</ENAMEX> employed to make it a reality are in thrall to a
worthy ideal. I might accuse them of being pernicious tools of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Satan</ENAMEX> (well, OK,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Disney</ENAMEX>), but I wouldn't be so disrespectful as to dismiss them lightly or
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">discredit</ENAMEX> (all of) their motives. Now, the same for books: I give just about
anyone high marks for writing one, and I hate to see any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> misread
cavalierly, as so regularly happens.

            Living in a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> so as to write about it can be a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soul</ENAMEX>-twisting commitment
for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX>, requiring a simultaneous existence as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spy</ENAMEX>, friend
and infidel. For taking on that task, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> deserve kudos.
All the more reason why I hate to see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ross</ENAMEX> dismissed, when to my mind his book
is not only more fun to read, it is also more ambitious and, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kurt Andersen</ENAMEX>
notwithstanding, better reported.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ross</ENAMEX>' book is not parallel to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Celebration, U.S.A.</ENAMEX> It is a complement
to it. It takes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the same year</TIMEX>, same <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, same questions, and many of the same
events, and hunts for their meaning in a very different direction. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Frantz</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Collins</ENAMEX>, with their solid (if seemingly cut-and-paste) history and assiduous
diary of whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX> beat up whose, etc., stay within the perimeter of
Celebration, within what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ross</ENAMEX> calls the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">White Vinyl Fence</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ross</ENAMEX>, to the
apparent consternation of some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reviewers</ENAMEX> but to my relief, strays beyond it.
You say <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Frantz</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Collins</ENAMEX> have done the relevant homework, but their
interviews with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Eisner</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert A.M. Stern</ENAMEX>, and others among the seminal
thinkers, funders, and power <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brokers</ENAMEX> who brought Celebration to pass, didn't
seem to draw those thinkers very deep into the matters that make Celebration an
experiment worth writing about. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ross</ENAMEX> seems to have engaged them a bit more in
that regard.

            The advantage of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ross</ENAMEX>' exploration is that he doesn't buy the conceit that
Celebration is a world apart. He makes it a part of the world, an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actor</ENAMEX> in a
larger ecology. This can be through the natural incursions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">alligators</ENAMEX> into
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>'s artificial lake and encephalitis-bearing <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes</ENAMEX> onto its iconic
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">porches</ENAMEX>. Or more significant, it can involve the human machinery behind the
building of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ross</ENAMEX> notes how the ransom that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Disney</ENAMEX> paid to Osceola
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">County</ENAMEX> for the favor of being exempt from providing low-income housing
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">assistance within Celebration</ENAMEX> was eaten up by theme-park <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> who could
not afford to live in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Celebration</ENAMEX> on a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Disney</ENAMEX> wage. He notes that, in local
real estate terms, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Celebration</ENAMEX> was not the anti-sprawl incentive that the New
Urbanists imagined but rather a beachhead for an expansion of suburban tract
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX>. And more than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Frantz</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Collins</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ross</ENAMEX> explores the significance
that makes Celebration not just another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reston</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hershey</ENAMEX> or
Pullman: its corporate sponsorship of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> in an age when corporations
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> are shuffling and re-dealing the cards of civic responsibility,
in what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ross</ENAMEX> calls "a consumer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">society</ENAMEX>'s rendition of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concerns</ENAMEX> of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founding fathers</ENAMEX>."

            This is where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Disney</ENAMEX> is more than just an irresistible candle to the moths
of snarky social critique. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Disney</ENAMEX> was uniquely positioned to foster the
preeminent attempt at a neotraditional <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>--no one else had the pocketbook,
interest, and reputation. But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Disney</ENAMEX> was also uniquely burdened--because its
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">parks</ENAMEX> were magnets for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Orlando</ENAMEX> sprawl that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Celebration</ENAMEX> is meant to correct
and because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Disney</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> is a historically <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-democratic</ENAMEX> institution
whose imposition of civic virtue in Celebration relies to some extent on
authoritarian principles, principles at odds with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> charter its
traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX> fa√ßades are calculated to evoke. This is extraordinary. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Disney</ENAMEX> find it extraordinary, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in love with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Disney</ENAMEX> who
flocked to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Celebration</ENAMEX> find it extraordinary, and thankfully,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Douglas Frantz</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Catherine Collins</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrew Ross</ENAMEX> find it extraordinary,
too, enough so to warrant spending <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> of their lives there. Do you truly
find Celebration unexceptional, except in its halo of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Disney</ENAMEX>-engendered
expectations?
