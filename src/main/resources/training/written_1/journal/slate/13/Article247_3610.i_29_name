            Yes, it's a red-letter <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Duff-Perelman</ENAMEX> day in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>, especially the
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$30,000-</NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a-month</TIMEX>-for-domestic-help item in her proposed budget. This is a
statistic that has affected me in the following way: I was appalled, and then,
shortly thereafter-very very shortly thereafter-I began to think about how nice
it would be to have that much domestic help.

            But to get back to your question <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ron Perelman</ENAMEX> (and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ron</ENAMEX>
Perelmans of the world), why is it that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> (sorry, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kurt</ENAMEX>) are so obtuse about
this? I can't tell you how many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> ask this question. I mean, don't you know
a) that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ron Perelman</ENAMEX> is kind of cute and b) that everyone sleeps with everyone
for all sorts of reasons and c) if only conventionally handsome <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> got laid,
this would be a seriously underpopulated world. As they say, there's a cover
for every pot, or something like that. Of course they also say it's as easy to
marry a rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> as a poor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>, and that is definitely not true.

            By the way, one of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Delia</ENAMEX>'s most brilliant observations on life,
and one that someone should have told <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Patricia Duff</ENAMEX> (not that she would have
listened) is this: Never marry a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> you wouldn't want to be divorced from.

            The article in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> reminds me, once again, how
much I wish <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Brokaw</ENAMEX> would run for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>. It would be one of the few
times I could genuinely be thrilled about the seamless blah-blah between
politics and entertainment. Why can't we get a groundswell going? And don't you
think <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Warren Beatty</ENAMEX> expected to be nominated by popular acclaim by now? That
story was truly a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three-day</TIMEX> wonder.

            I am struggling hard with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary</ENAMEX> thing. Of course I will vote for her,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">etc.</ENAMEX>, but I've been stunned at how many of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>, my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women friends</ENAMEX>, my
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>-who-are-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX>-and-successful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>, have no enthusiasm for her
candidacy at all. The Talk interview, by the way, was devastating for
her with that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">constituency</ENAMEX>, I think, because there was a hope that she would
win the race and shed the bastard, and she blew that away with all that
exculpatory dialogue. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Incidentally</ENAMEX>, I have become obsessed with how they
never pay for anything . It's amazing. How do they do it? Now there's a book
he could write when he's no longer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>, and everyone would buy it. All
summer I kept reading idiotic articles in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX> about things like
where they are going to spend their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer vacation</TIMEX>, and no one mentioned that
the only factor that truly operates in that decision is who they can get to
give them a free <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX>.)

            Of course, there are <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14 months</TIMEX> to go. Can you believe it? <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Fourteen</NUMEX> more
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> of this?

            Are we being paid for this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX>? If so, I am giving all the money to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxfam</ENAMEX>.

            Your devoted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX>, etc.
