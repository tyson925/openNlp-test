               On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lutheran</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roman Catholic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> signed a joint declaration,
resolving a conflict that began exactly <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">482</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX>. It turns out that, on
this point, both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX> believe the same thing. What?

               "Please be a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX>," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesse Helms</ENAMEX> chided <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lynn Woolsey</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Calif.</ENAMEX>, in
a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> hearing room <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX>. Then he sicced the cops on her. What had Woolsey
done?
            

            "Dared
to venture out without her chador."-- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lisa Dickey</ENAMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Crawford</ENAMEX>
had a similar answer.)

            "She
ordered the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">14-ounce</NUMEX> strip steak, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> double <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dewar</ENAMEX>'s on the rocks, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dessert</ENAMEX>,
instead of the diet plate."-- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leslie Goodman</ENAMEX>-Malamuth
            

            "She
let her <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">duck</ENAMEX> out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> without its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">diaper</ENAMEX> on. Apparently that's another

               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Randy</ENAMEX>'s Wrap-Up
            

            Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> suggested that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Woolsey</ENAMEX> vexed
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helms</ENAMEX> with her unladylike display of proto-male behavior--spitting, cursing,
and scratching your balls. Coincidentally, this is precisely what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Naomi Wolf</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">advised Al Gore</ENAMEX> to do, advice for which he was paying her <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$15,000</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a month</TIMEX>. In
an effort to appear to be earning her money, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolf</ENAMEX> called this "being an alpha
male," but it was basically spitting, cursing, and ball-scratching.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolf</ENAMEX> also counseled <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> to "speak from the heart,"
creating tension with campaign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staffers</ENAMEX> who were pressing him to "lie your fool
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> off." In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dick Morris</ENAMEX> told the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> , it was
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolf</ENAMEX> who persuaded <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> to wear earth tones and not the silver <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mylar</ENAMEX> posing
strap he was said (by me) to be considering. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolf</ENAMEX> had the guts to support the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX>'s shift to brown, olive-green, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tan shades</ENAMEX>. It's like
something out of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Profiles in Courage</ENAMEX> , albeit something my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mom</ENAMEX> would have
done for considerably less than <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$15,000</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a month</TIMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> has gone to great lengths to conceal <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolf</ENAMEX>'s
role, funneling her payments through other consulting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX> so that her name
would not appear on financial reports filed with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Election</ENAMEX>
Commission.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Woolsey</ENAMEX> has not
attempted to conceal anything: She's so alpha!

            
               There's a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> and a
Place for Every Answer
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Woolsey</ENAMEX> led <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX>, all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>,
who tried to present <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helms</ENAMEX> with a letter in favor of an international treaty
opposing discrimination against <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helms</ENAMEX> has blocked a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> vote on this
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.N.</ENAMEX> accord for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20 years</TIMEX>.

            The letter was signed by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>;
the pact has been ratified by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">165</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nations</ENAMEX>; the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> is not one of
them. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helms</ENAMEX> had <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Capitol</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">police</ENAMEX> throw the congresswomen out.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York</ENAMEX>
Times quotes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helms</ENAMEX>, after the incident, saying, "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Heh</ENAMEX>, heh."

            
               Pride Goeth Before an
Extra
            

            Appearing on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fox News</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> , bloated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">overreacher</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Trump</ENAMEX> offered brief characterizations of
several <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nations</ENAMEX>. Which of the following is an actual bit of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trump</ENAMEX> fatuity, and
which is an attempt to mock his hubris through amusing hyperbole?

            

               <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>--"They're ripping us big league."

               <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>--"The worst <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> that this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> has ever had."

               <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>--"They are a very disloyal group in terms of their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>."

               <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>--"They have to be taught respect."

               <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>--"They'll sell a nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapon</ENAMEX> to anybody giving them <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10 cents</NUMEX> more
than the next <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX>. What? We're the world's biggest arms <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealer</ENAMEX>? Really? Bigger
than the stupid <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>?"

               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zambobo</ENAMEX>--"<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bunch</ENAMEX> of jerks, not as bad as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>, but <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">... Hey</ENAMEX>! That's not a
real <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>!"

               <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>--"Wants to take over the world economically."

               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pat Riley</ENAMEX>'s hair--"Takes such advantage of us with the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX>."

               <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX>--"They have boats bigger than any <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> you've ever
seen."

               <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX>--"They have houses all over the world, including <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Palm</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beach</ENAMEX>."

               <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX>--"They have <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> like you've never seen before--all because
we're so stupid."

               <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX>--"They stink. But not as much as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>."

               <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>--"They stink. Just as much as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>.
Which is what they are!"
