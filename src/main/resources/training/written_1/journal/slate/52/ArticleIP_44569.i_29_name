            I have several
questions.
For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few months</TIMEX>
A radio business channel
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX> carried
Thrice <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hourly</TIMEX> reports
On the stock market--
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bloomfield</ENAMEX> report.
Suddenly it was gone
And replaced by a
Monotonous religious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX>.
I couldn't find it
Anywhere on the dial.
Why did that happen?
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Massac</ENAMEX> came from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Casamusetts</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cassam</ENAMEX> came from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Massachusetts</ENAMEX>
               .

They tell you that vitamin E,
Grape <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">juice</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX>
Thin the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> and
Reduce <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> buildup
But if you take two
Or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of these
Substances regularly, do they
Thin it too much,
Causing other, unforeseen
Dangers of an interactive sort?
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Massac</ENAMEX> came from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Casamusetts</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cassam</ENAMEX> came from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Massachusetts</ENAMEX>
               .

If all politics is a lie
We tell ourselves, if
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> who think they are
Conservative have horrible
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anarchic</ENAMEX> lives, raping <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
And <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who think
They are radical, and
Tell you so, typically,
Are repressed, authoritarian, and
Thinly frigid in their
Personal bearings,
Leaving the world on both sides
To be divided up between
Aggressive territorial types
Finding ideological excuses
To kill other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>--
If all this is patently,
Obviously so, so that
Only poetry, and not
Politics can save us--
Is there any hope for us then?
