               In a TV commercial debuting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesperson</ENAMEX> says: "It made
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> believe again, feel free again." Who's pitching what?

               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Randy</ENAMEX>'s Wrap-Up
            

            Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX> conflated feeling free and feeling
fresh. The distinction between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> is apparent in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin Luther King Jr.</ENAMEX>'s
eloquent and moving, "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">I Have a Dream</ENAMEX>" speech, which would have been much less
effective had he concluded, "Fresh at last, fresh at last, thank God almighty,
I'm fresh at last."

            In <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> history, "feeling free" refers to
ridding the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> of an oppressive monarch, a view expressed in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Declaration of Independence</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> advertising, "feeling fresh" refers to
ridding oneself of vaginal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">odor</ENAMEX>, a view expressed by a fashion model clad in
white who has plucked every <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hair</ENAMEX> from her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> and then painted in some
artificial eyebrows and perhaps drawn a silhouette of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Jefferson</ENAMEX> to
replace her pubic hair.

            It's like aromatherapy
as political expression: "We have nothing to fear but â€¦ is there a funny smell
in here? Is it me?" That's the slogan <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Naomi Wolf</ENAMEX> was paid <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$15,000</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a month</TIMEX> to
provide <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Gore</ENAMEX>. Or was it "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Sweet Smell of No Sex</ENAMEX>!" Or the rule-of-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>,
"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Odorless, Colorless, Tasteless</ENAMEX>!" Or perhaps it was alpha-malevolent: "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Now With</ENAMEX>
Real <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Beef Aroma</ENAMEX>." Somebody stop me. Was it "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Scents and Fiscal Sensibility"</ENAMEX>?
Hang on. Do I smell smoke? Yes, it's me. I'm hot! And menstrual. Somebody turn
a hose on me!

Answer
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mayor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rudolph Giuliani</ENAMEX> is pitching
himself.

            In a spot running only in upstate <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>--the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mayor</ENAMEX> is particularly popular with those who've never lived where he
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">governs</ENAMEX>--he touts his economic policies. Just before he delivers his toothy
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">slogan</ENAMEX>, the narrator says: "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rudy Giuliani</ENAMEX> got to work, creating a record
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">341,000</NUMEX> new jobs. Cutting taxes over <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2 billion</NUMEX>. Leading <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> off welfare and
requiring those on it to work. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rudy</ENAMEX> has made <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> the safest large <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>."

            What the narrator does
not say is that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> of all <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">New Yorkers</ENAMEX> live below the poverty line, a
number that has not improved under this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mayor</ENAMEX>, even after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nine years</TIMEX> of
economic expansion. But maybe that will be on the bumper stickers.
