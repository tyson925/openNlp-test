of the fall of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Berlin Wall</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twenty-seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> have sprouted out of the
former <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">bloc</ENAMEX>, and ethnicity has replaced ideology as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>'s primary
source of friction. Despite the growing pains of economic reform, including
income contraction and worsening public health, a "free-market consensus" has
emerged in the ex-Communist <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>. ... A survey argues
that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> is dematerializing. Power is being passed upward to the European
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Union</ENAMEX> and downward to new parliaments in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Scotland</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wales</ENAMEX>.

            The
cover story claims that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reform Party</ENAMEX> is kaput.
After <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ross Perot</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX> run, the mainstream parties assimilated his
deficit-reduction platform. Campaign-finance reform was also co-opted. Without
a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cogent contrarian platform</ENAMEX>, a protest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> is doomed. ... A

<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> debate. His congeniality made him look presidential next to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">loony Alan Keyes</ENAMEX>. The piece also argues that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George W. Bush</ENAMEX>'s draft-dodging,
triangulating, and poll-tracking allow his <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponents</ENAMEX> to tar him as
