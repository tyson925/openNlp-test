However shaky its methodology, online polling is already a reality. Online
voting, too, is being debated in a variety of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX>.

            Now,
one Internet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> has announced that it will hold an online primary--among a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> bigger than the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> combined:
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>.

            During
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the week of March 1, 2000</TIMEX>, a new Web site called <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">"Majority 2000: Women Count</ENAMEX>"
plans to hold a nationwide primary, designed to gauge the way <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> will vote
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Super</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> primary <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 14</TIMEX>. Calling itself a "political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>'s
portal for presidential politics," the site is a joint project between Good
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Housekeeping</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Women</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> site. (They became
corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">siblings</ENAMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Women</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX> merged with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hearst</ENAMEX>, Good
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Housekeeping</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">publisher</ENAMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January of this year</TIMEX>.) The virtual primary
will be the culmination of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several months</TIMEX> of online surveys designed both to
provide information about which political issues are important to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> and to
determine how <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> are likely to vote.

            
Explaining the rationale for the new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">site</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lisa Stone</ENAMEX>, programming <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Women</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX>, says, "It's an underreported fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> have been the voting
majority since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1964</TIMEX>." In the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">1996</ENAMEX> race, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> was re-elected
largely because of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>-point gender split in his favor among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women voters</ENAMEX>.
"In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the same year</TIMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> are poised to take over the Net, we'll also choose
who our next <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> will be," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stone</ENAMEX> adds.

            The
Majority <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> site, which plans to launch <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next January</TIMEX>, is part of a growing
trend of powerful voting blocs using the Internet to flex their political
muscles. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Earlier this month</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AFL-CIO</ENAMEX> announced that it was partnering with
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Massachusetts</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> iBelong to produce a Web service called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Workingfamilies</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">com</ENAMEX>.
Scheduled to launch <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Dec. 1</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Workingfamilies</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX> will offer all the features of
a traditional Internet service <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">provider</ENAMEX>, plus added <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> to make it easy
for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> to contact elected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporations</ENAMEX>. Other efforts
include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rock</ENAMEX> the Vote, aimed at young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Starmedia</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">soon-to-be-</ENAMEX>launched <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Voto 2000</TIMEX>, which targets the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latino</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX>.

            In
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxygen Media</ENAMEX> announced that it had received <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$4.5 million</NUMEX> from the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Markle Foundation</ENAMEX> to form <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Oxygen-Markle Plus</ENAMEX>, a publicly accessible
market-research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX> designed to measure and reflect <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>'s opinions on a
variety of subjects from consumer tastes to public affairs. That project uses
the politically connected polling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Penn-Schoen & Berland</ENAMEX>, which has
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">counted Bill Clinton</ENAMEX> among its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clients</ENAMEX>. For its part, the Good
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Housekeeping -Women</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX> project is retaining <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harris Interactive</ENAMEX>, one of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">premier</ENAMEX> online polling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX>.

            Of
course, the political impact of such Net initiatives has yet to be proved. But
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Good Housekeeping and Women</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">com</ENAMEX> say that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elizabeth Dole</ENAMEX>'s
withdrawal <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX> from the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> presidential primary convinced them that
such a project was necessary. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">More than 1,800</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> responded to an online
survey about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dole</ENAMEX>'s candidacy, and many wrote heartfelt responses. Marqueta
Bentley, of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oklahoma City</ENAMEX>, for example, wrote, "I was sad when I heard that
Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dole</ENAMEX> had pulled from the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> Presidential Race. I and many of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>
think that Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dole</ENAMEX> has impeccable credentials and would have been a very
knowledgeable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>. I hope that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> will choose Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dole</ENAMEX> as his
running <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mate</ENAMEX>. We are ready to put Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dole</ENAMEX> to work in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>. She has
paid her dues politically and proved to be an asset in any position she has
held."

            "We believe that this is
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the instruments that can help give <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> the sense that their vote
really matters," says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ellen Levine</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Good Housekeeping</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX>.
