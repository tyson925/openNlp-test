                  Dear
Pru,
               
            

            
               I am a 21-year-old
male living with my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girlfriend</ENAMEX>. I have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> with her, but I've been going
out with my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX>. The problem is that my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX> knows about my
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girlfriend</ENAMEX>, and I don't know what to do. What's worse, I think I'm falling in
love with my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX>. Can you help?
            

            

               --<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M.D.</ENAMEX>
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dear M.</ENAMEX>,

            Help you what? Move? Get
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unattached</ENAMEX>? <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudie</ENAMEX> is fascinated that the problem you're concerned with is your
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">neighbor</ENAMEX>'s knowing about your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girlfriend</ENAMEX> . Usually a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> is spooked if
his significant other knows about the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX>! Prudie must tell you that a
number of things seem less than optimal here. You have barely reached your
majority, yet you have already fathered <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">offspring</ENAMEX>--while unmarried--and are
being unfaithful to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> to whom you've presumably made a commitment. It
would really be lovely, for all concerned, if you were having a goof with
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudie</ENAMEX>. On the off chance that your letter is on the level, it could be that
the purpose of your life is to serve as a warning to others. If you do
call it a day with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> of your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, you will be spared a divorce
... but will remain financially responsible for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> support. If you do make
an alliance with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudie</ENAMEX> hopes you will move. And do try to stop
being so horizontally accessible. Given your age, you could very well populate
the whole neighborhood.

                  Prudie,
               
            

            
               I have a problem, I
hate my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>. She has been cheating on him for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past year</TIMEX>. (They
have only been married <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX>.) She treats him terribly, and she tells me she
hates my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>. I have been trying to ignore her comments, but it's
impossible. Do I tell my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> how I feel or continue to hold my
tongue?
            

            

               --<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Seething</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dear Seethe</ENAMEX>,

            What do you think the chances are that your
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sister-in-law</ENAMEX> lives near the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fellow</ENAMEX> who wrote the previous letter? Only kidding
... though all these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">loose people</ENAMEX> are really no laughing matter.

            From your report of the
timetable, your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> started the marriage with no intention of being
faithful. Chances are that if you know she's running around, it's likely
your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> does, too. The fact that she treats him terribly, however, is
definitely known to him, and it is for this reason that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudie</ENAMEX> suggests you say
nothing. He is either masochistically neurotic or is figuring out how to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">extricate</ENAMEX> himself. The only mechanistic thing you can do is make yourself
scarce. And should your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> ask your opinion, give it to him.

            
--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudie</ENAMEX>, pragmatically

            
               
                  Dear
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudence</ENAMEX>,
               
            

            
               I'm a 27-year-old
gay <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX>. My problem is that I've fallen for this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> I've been chatting with on
the Internet for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past six months</TIMEX>. "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Seth"</ENAMEX> thinks of me as someone he can
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">confide</ENAMEX> in, not as a potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boyfriend</ENAMEX>. He's a serious bodybuilder and says
he's looking for muscular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> only. While I do have a toned bod, I am
definitely not of the bodybuilder ilk. My question: How can I convince <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Seth</ENAMEX>
that we would be perfect together (even though I'm not a bodybuilder)? He
doesn't seem interested in meeting. The only thing he does seem interested in
is pouring his heart out to me about how difficult it is to find a muscular
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mate</ENAMEX>. Please advise.
            

            

               --<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Looking for Love</ENAMEX>
            

            Dear Look,

            Take a deep breath and
face the facts. You are interested in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX>, this chap is interested in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pecs</ENAMEX> and lats. Your cybercrush sounds like a muscle-bound moron, and you would
not be perfect together. Where is the commonality of interests? You
might try to figure out why you are attracted, even electronically, to someone
who is whining to you about his inability to find another bodybuilder. For
whatever reason, you want what you can't have. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudie</ENAMEX> hopes you will refocus,
consider yourself lucky, and move on to another chat <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>. Or better yet, start
going out .

            
--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudie</ENAMEX>, sociably

            
               
                  Dear
Prudie,
               
            

            
               I accepted a new job <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of months ago</TIMEX> and
relocated to another <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, which is away from my grown <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>. The new job
has been fantastic, and I felt I made the right decision in moving. Until a few
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks ago</TIMEX>, anyway. My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> was moved laterally within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX>, and
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> they hired is an ex-manager of mine and the cause of my leaving my
old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>! He totally disrespects <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> and anyone not in his field. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> knows that I cannot and will not work for him. I have requested an
inter-company transfer so I would not be his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subordinate</ENAMEX>. I have another job
offer, in yet another <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, which I rejected to accept this position--but they
still want me to work for them.
            

            
               I am getting ready
to sign a lease for my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">housing</ENAMEX> but am unsure if I want to stay here if I'm
forced to keep this position. What do you think I should do?
            

            

               --<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Haunted</ENAMEX>
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dear Haunt</ENAMEX>,

            Move quickly. That is, get a commitment from a
superior that you will be given a different job where you're not reporting to
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">chauvinist pig</ENAMEX>, er, former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX>. Don't be shy about mentioning the other
offer. You say that your current management understands your aversion to this
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>. If you can get an ironclad guarantee of another position, sign the lease
and get on with your life.

            If you feel there is any
dilly-dallying on the part of your new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employer</ENAMEX>, having already left the area
where your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> live would make one more move merely a temporary
inconvenience. If you do not get a firm promise of an inter-company transfer,
by all means go to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> that still wants you. If that happens, and if
what's-his-name winds up working for them it should be Ripley you write
to, not <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudie</ENAMEX>.

            
--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudie</ENAMEX>, hopefully
