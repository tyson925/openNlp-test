                  Dear
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudence</ENAMEX>,
               
            

            
               Your recent column
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about</NUMEX> emboldens me to ask perhaps a rude question. Is it bad manners for a
guest to excuse himself from the dinner table, go to the small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bathroom</ENAMEX> off the
dining <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>, and attempt to participate in the conversation? Our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacob</ENAMEX>
does just that. Do you think he should wander upstairs, and if not, at least be
silent?
            

            

               --Just Wondering
            

            Dear Just,

            Prudie, too, hates to
miss a minute of good dinner party talk, but your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacob</ENAMEX> goes too far.
Hollering from the loo is not acceptable. When you issue the next invitation,
tell him you'd like it if he would take a timeout from the badinage when
he needs to leave the table. Tell him it's a little idiosyncrasy of yours that
you think <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> conversing at the table should ... be at the table.

                  Dear
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudence</ENAMEX>,
               
            

            
               My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">matron</ENAMEX> of honor is unexpectedly moving away.
She is a good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX>, and I will be sorry to see her leave. Now I need to ask
another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> to be in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the wedding</TIMEX>, which is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two months</TIMEX> away. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> I
want to ask is actually my best <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX>, and she lives in another <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. She
already knows that I had asked someone else to stand up for me, so my question
is: How do I now ask her to be my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">matron</ENAMEX> of honor? She is really the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> I
wanted anyway--she just lives far away.
            

            
               Help!
            

            

               --<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A.G.</ENAMEX>
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dear A.</ENAMEX>,

            There are a few loose ends to your problem. First,
is the reigning <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">matron</ENAMEX> of honor moving to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bangladesh</ENAMEX>? <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> travel to weddings
all the time. Your best <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">replacement matron</ENAMEX> of honor, herself, lives out
of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. It is not immediately obvious why she wouldn't have been asked in the
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> place ... being your best <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX>.

            If, however, traveling
back for the festivities is for some reason impossible for the current <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M. of</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudie</ENAMEX> suggests you garland the truth with sentiment when you ask your best
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">friend</ENAMEX>. Simply tell her she was your first choice, but you were trying to spare
her the expense ... her living "far away," etc., and you would be thrilled if
she were able to stand up for you. If she is a real <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> and can spare the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> and money, she will understand and accept. If not, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudie</ENAMEX> recommends you
figure out your <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> choice. Perhaps someone local.

                  Dear
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudence</ENAMEX>,
               
            

            
               At a small gathering
with out-of-town <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shenandoah</ENAMEX> recently, the discussion turned to
politics. I don't wish to be specific, but a prominent national figure was
compared to the "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Antichrist</ENAMEX>." I am reluctant to identify the target
specifically, because I allow for honest differences of opinion. My disclaimer
notwithstanding, does one have to be a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> to comment on the Antichrist
comparison? <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> part of me says the allusion is nonreligious, having to do with
an assessment of evil ... fair game for anyone. Yet another voice whispers that
I should shy away from discussing the hagiography (or whatever) of a different
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">faith</ENAMEX>. Please let me know how <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudence</ENAMEX> would have reacted.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dear From</ENAMEX>,

            The historical <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus</ENAMEX> is
such a part of ancient and modern thought that reference to him has little to
do with whether one is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">believer</ENAMEX> or not. That particular phrase has become
part of the language. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudie</ENAMEX>, in fact, refers to her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">starter husband</ENAMEX> that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX>.) As for the whispering voice that's telling you one should shy away from
discussing faiths to which one does not belong, tell it that there is even a
college course dealing with this subject. It is called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Comparative Religion</ENAMEX>. In
an ecumenical spirit, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudie</ENAMEX> wanted to answer you in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Islamic</ENAMEX> pentameter, but
she is fluent only in limericks.

                  Dear
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudence</ENAMEX>,
               
            

            
               I have seen many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> drive haphazardly
through parking <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lots</ENAMEX>. I have even seen one or two flip me the bird because I
happened to obey the law, even stopping at the stop signs, which annoyingly
slows them down. Believe me, it takes great willpower to not chase after them
and shake them until their teeth rattle. Yes, you have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who take
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">handicapped</ENAMEX> spots when they have no right to be parking there, but even worse
are these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crazies</ENAMEX> who think that parking <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lots</ENAMEX> are just enclosed
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">highways</ENAMEX>.
            

            
               My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandmother</ENAMEX> was
in a serious accident in a parking lot <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several years ago</TIMEX> because of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of
these crazies. He slammed into her, then had the nerve to get out of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>,
lie down on the ground, and say he had whiplash. He blamed her! She had to go
to court as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defendant</ENAMEX> (!) all because he was trying to get out of the lot
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> by speeding around her. The point is that some young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">jerk</ENAMEX> almost killed
her in a parking lot because he didn't want to wait. How do we deal with these
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">impatient</ENAMEX>, asinine, automotive airheads?
            

            

               --Aggravated
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dear Ag</ENAMEX>,

            Calm yourself. This is
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of those irritants that is very difficult to redress. Our whole society,
not just <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drivers</ENAMEX>, has become increasingly impatient and always in a hurry. Road
rage is one byproduct of the behavior you are concerned about. Defensive
driving is probably the most constructive thing you can do. Whenever you see a
person driving erratically, reduce your own speed and try to get out of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX>. If you think someone is breaking a law, take down the license plate number
and call the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX>. It would be nice if all parking <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lots</ENAMEX> would put in those
bumps to make slower speeds mandatory, but that is not going to happen. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Alas,</ENAMEX>
vehicular rodeos are here to stay, so just count to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>. Well, maybe <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>.

                  Dear
Prudie,
               
            

            
               After many
discussions among my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>, we still have not come to any conclusion about
whether we would live with someone before we married them. Do you think that
living with someone before marriage gives the marriage a more stable foundation
on which to build, or is cohabitation better left until after marriage? We were
considering the divorce rate <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these days</TIMEX> and whether this is a significant
variable in the increase, or has society changed its values?
            

            
               --Yours
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sincerely</ENAMEX>,
            

            

               Mellie
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dear Mel</ENAMEX>,

            Your question is a kind
of hybrid of "To be or not to be" and "Which came <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chicken</ENAMEX> or the
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">egg</ENAMEX>?" There are so many variables that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudie</ENAMEX> would not consider offering a
rule or an opinion. This is one of those decisions that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> must make
based on their values, circumstances, upbringing, and beliefs. Living together
without benefit of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clergy</ENAMEX> can be destructive, instructive, useful, a mess, or a
blessing. How's that for waffling?
