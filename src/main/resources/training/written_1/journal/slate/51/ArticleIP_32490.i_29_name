            In
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Singapore</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madeleine Albright</ENAMEX> met <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Foreign Minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tang Jiaxuan</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this weekend</TIMEX>, the Straits Times said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> relations are now
on the mend because both <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> oppose <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX>'s abandonment of the "one
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>" policy. In its main front-page story, the paper quoted <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tang</ENAMEX> as saying,
"If I were a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalist</ENAMEX> writing an article on the issue, the headline for my
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">article</ENAMEX> would be 'Trouble <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">maker</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee Teng</ENAMEX>-hui.' " But the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreign minister</ENAMEX> also
warned the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> that it must "not say anything or do anything that
will fan the flames of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> independence or encourage <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee Teng-hui</ENAMEX>'s
separatist remarks or activities."

            
Another attack on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> was made <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX> in an editorial in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pakistani</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Dawn</ENAMEX> , which said his "<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>" policy was beyond
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">comprehension</ENAMEX>. It might be a political ploy to help his ruling Kuomintang
Party, it said, but it is doubtful that this will work, since public opinion on
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> wants peaceful relations with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> and is not united behind
independence. According to <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Dawn</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> positive factor in the crisis is
the position of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, which "has rapped <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> on the knuckles for
its recalcitrance." The editorial said, "The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> would not want the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">East Asian</ENAMEX> region to be destabilized at a time when <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> are
in the process of mending fences. It is therefore quite possible that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">President</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lee</ENAMEX> might, after all, be persuaded by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> to modify his stance and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">revert</ENAMEX> to his earlier position."

            The
official China
Daily invoked "legal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX>" to justify the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>'s ban last week
on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Falun Gong</ENAMEX> religious sect, which favors deep-breathing exercises. It
quoted <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wang Liming</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> law school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX>, as saying that the sect had
violated the human rights of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">followers</ENAMEX> by telling them not to take medicine
or to consult <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South China Morning Post</ENAMEX> reported that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> kept the heat on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Falun Gong</ENAMEX> by
rounding up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 5,000</NUMEX> of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> and identifying its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX>. They
will be released once they make written confessions and promise to leave the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sect</ENAMEX>, according to a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX>.

            The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCMP</ENAMEX> said in an editorial that press freedom is under threat in both the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philippines</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Thailand</ENAMEX>. It claimed that in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philippines</ENAMEX> "financial
chicanery" is being employed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Estrada</ENAMEX> to muzzle the press as
he approaches the end of his <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> term. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manila</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> is facing
"death by corporate strangulation" after being sold to a real estate developer
"in mysterious circumstances," it said. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manila</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> was forced to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">apologize to Estrada</ENAMEX> for a story about his alleged part in a contract award,
and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalists</ENAMEX> involved resigned in protest. Now the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> has been closed
down while the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">owner</ENAMEX> "reorganises" the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>. Meanwhile, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philippine</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Daily</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inquirer</ENAMEX> has become the victim of an advertising boycott by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cronies</ENAMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Estrada</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCMP</ENAMEX> said. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Thailand</ENAMEX>'s "vigorous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">press</ENAMEX>" could also be at
risk after "an incident <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this month</TIMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">gun</ENAMEX>-toting forces raided the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Thai</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> , following its publication of a critical remark about the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">deputy prime</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minister</ENAMEX>." The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCMP</ENAMEX> said, "Only <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> retains its diverse, free
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">media</ENAMEX>; but even <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> has not escaped criticism from some mainland
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supporters</ENAMEX> who think it the duty of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalists</ENAMEX> to act as
propaganda <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Government</ENAMEX>."

            In
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX>, both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ha'aretz</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jerusalem Post</ENAMEX> led their front pages with the same
story--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Clinton</ENAMEX>'s disappointment that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Syrian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hafez Assad</ENAMEX> failed
to attend the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">funeral</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hassan II</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Morocco</ENAMEX>. "I'm slightly concerned and
don't quite understand why he didn't come," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> told <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israeli</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalists</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rabat</ENAMEX>. "Perhaps he wasn't feeling well. I have been in ongoing contact with
him, and was hoping to see him here and perhaps have him and [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prime Minister</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ehud</ENAMEX>] <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barak</ENAMEX> meet each other." Asked if he liked <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Assad</ENAMEX>, formerly shunned by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX> for being a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sponsor</ENAMEX> of terrorism, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> described him as "very
experienced and trustworthy; a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> of his word." <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> reiterated that he is
optimistic about the prospects for peace in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Middle East</ENAMEX>. "I'm extremely
upbeat about the peace process," he said.

            In an
editorial, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jerusalem Post</ENAMEX> warned <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barak</ENAMEX> to play his cards carefully when
he embarks <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> on his first serious working session with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palestinian</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yasser Arafat</ENAMEX>. While there are "very high public expectations of rapid
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">breakthroughs</ENAMEX>," it is clear that "all will not be easy and wonderful. The
number of items complicating talks with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Palestinians</ENAMEX> is staggering:
left-over commitments from previous agreements; questions of compliance and
reciprocity; a volatile <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Palestinian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, which can easily be incited to
violent disorders; a still-intact <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hamas</ENAMEX> terrorism infrastructure; and, of
course, difficult talks on the future of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jerusalem</ENAMEX>, settlements, borders, and
the outlines of a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Palestinian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>," the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> said gloomily.

            

               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ha'aretz</ENAMEX> 's editorial <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX> was on the late <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hassan</ENAMEX>. "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hassan</ENAMEX>'s
friendship toward <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX>, and the fondness that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israelis</ENAMEX> feel for him, cannot
replace a sober examination of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Moroccan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX> and
government," it said, pointing out that it was only during that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last two years</TIMEX>
of his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38-year</TIMEX> reign that he started to show an interest in human rights. "The
passing of the reins to his son, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mohammed VI</ENAMEX>, brings grounds for hope that
the concept of kingliness will not be synonymous with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">dictatorship</ENAMEX>," it added.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ha'aretz</ENAMEX> said that the change of rule in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Morocco</ENAMEX>, as has already
happened in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jordan</ENAMEX> and will soon happen in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Syria</ENAMEX>, is part of a process by which
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> world is passing to the next generation. It said, "The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> is passing to young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> educated by Western culture, cognizant of
modern technology; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> relatively free, one hopes, of the burden of the
region's violent history. This new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> may test its relations with
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> according to modern concerns of economic cooperation, which may replace,
or at least weaken, the ideology intended to perpetuate the conflict."

            The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sydney Morning</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Herald</ENAMEX> ran an editorial <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX> anticipating another collision with the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX> over genetically modified <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX>. Complaining that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Australian</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> are being kept in the dark about which food products have <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> content,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> noted that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> "regards labelling as an obstacle to
free trade." It said, "This is a serious issue which needs to be taken up in
the appropriate multilateral trade forums. It must not, however, become a
convenient excuse for failing to protect the legitimate interests of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Australian</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX>."
