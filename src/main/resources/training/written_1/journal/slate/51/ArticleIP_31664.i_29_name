            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard Law School</ENAMEX> has undertaken a process of
long-term strategic planning "so as to maximize achievement of its core
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mission</ENAMEX>," according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dean Robert Clark</ENAMEX>'s semigrammatical but completely
businesslike manifesto in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>'s alumni bulletin. As part of this
process, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HLS</ENAMEX> has hired the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s pre-eminent consulting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX>--<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McKinsey</ENAMEX> &
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Co.</ENAMEX>--to explain why law <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> are unhappy.

            This is not a difficult or mysterious question. It
has been explored in books such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard D. Kahlenberg</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Broken</ENAMEX>
Contract and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Jay Osborn</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Paper Chase</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">One L</ENAMEX> , a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">first-year</ENAMEX>-law-student memoir by future <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">novelist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scott Turow</ENAMEX>. The complaints
don't change much. Most law <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> are there for lack of a better idea rather
than any special enthusiasm for the subject matter. They are heading for a
profession that is widely despised and filled with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> who wish they
weren't. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">These days</TIMEX>, top law <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> can anticipate being regarded as sharks
even as other career options--investment banking, Internet startups--pass them
by in glamour, prestige, and financial reward.

            Meanwhile, they are
paying <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$40,000</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> to sit in large lecture <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">halls</ENAMEX> and be hazed at random by a
distant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> with a seating chart. The curriculum mostly consists of long
appellate opinions from which they are supposed to derive legal principles on
the needle-in-a-haystack principle. These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> pillars of legal education--the
so-called "Socratic method" and the "case method"--were both pioneered at
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard</ENAMEX> and survive there less changed than anywhere else.

            No one forces these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> to go to law school or to
choose <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard</ENAMEX> in particular. Indeed, they compete fiercely to get in. But this
just puts them in an even sourer mood when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. News & World</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Report</ENAMEX> 's annual rankings list <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard Law School</ENAMEX> not merely No. 2 behind
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yale</ENAMEX> but, for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past two years</TIMEX>, tied for that honor with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stanford</ENAMEX>.

            What concerns the HLS
administration is not so much that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard</ENAMEX> law <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> are depressed, it's
that publicized studies show that they're depressed. A <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">National</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jurist</ENAMEX> survey assessing "overall <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> satisfaction" ranked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard Law</ENAMEX>
at the bottom of the pack--154 th out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">165</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HLS</ENAMEX> came in dead last
when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Princeton Review</ENAMEX> asked <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11,000</NUMEX> law <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">140</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> to
quantify their "quality of life." Now we have something the modern university
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">administrator</ENAMEX> can deal with. This is not psychiatry: This is <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>.

            There is nothing to be ashamed of in seeing a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">psychiatrist</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">um</ENAMEX>, management <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultant</ENAMEX>. Nevertheless, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HLS</ENAMEX> did not announce that it was
seeking help. In fact, an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alumni</ENAMEX> survey went out on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dean</ENAMEX>'s own letterhead
and included a return envelope addressed to the suspiciously inconspicuous
"<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Research International</ENAMEX>." I received <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX>. It was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> pages long and
contained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">104</NUMEX> questions about my experience at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>, from which I
graduated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>. Meanwhile, a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-member <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McKinsey</ENAMEX> "engagement <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX>" set up
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">shop</ENAMEX> in a vacant law school <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Team McKinsey</ENAMEX> surveyed current <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> and
organized <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> focus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> on demographic themes: married <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>, gay
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Latino</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard Law Review</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>, and so on. Not
wishing to be left out, the law school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">faculty</ENAMEX> voted unanimously to expand the
scope of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McKinsey</ENAMEX>'s work to include faculty governance issues. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Faculty</ENAMEX> and
staff were interviewed individually, as befits their rank.

            Actually, it makes as much sense for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard Law</ENAMEX>
School to hire a management <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultant</ENAMEX> as it does for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Motors</ENAMEX> to do
so--though how much sense that is exactly is an open question. Systematic data
on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>' concerns might be just what is needed by a law school
administration that has ignored mounds of anecdotal evidence. But turning to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McKinsey</ENAMEX> was a bit odd since the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> draws heavily on HLS for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recruits</ENAMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> out of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">McKinseyites</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HLS</ENAMEX> project are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HLS</ENAMEX> graduates. The
godfather of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McKinsey</ENAMEX> method (yes, another method), former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managing partner</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marvin Bower</ENAMEX>, is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard</ENAMEX>-trained <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX>, whose innovation was to infuse
consulting with law<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">-firm</ENAMEX> professionalism. In light of this connection, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McKinsey</ENAMEX>
is giving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard</ENAMEX> a steep discount. The study will only cost <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">HLS</NUMEX> a couple of
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">hundred thousand dollars</NUMEX>.

            The connection should
also mean that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McKinsey</ENAMEX> enjoys a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> start in understanding the problem at
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard Law School</ENAMEX>. But it does raise a logical conundrum: If they had such a
lousy education, how good could they be as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultants</ENAMEX>? Conversely, if they are
as good as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McKinsey</ENAMEX>'s mystique implies, how bad could their professional
training have been?

            But coming up with the right answer to a question like,
"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Why Are Harvard Law Students Unhappy?</ENAMEX>" should not tax the analytical skills
even of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard</ENAMEX> law <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">graduates</ENAMEX>. And, furthermore, the study's conclusions are
more or less irrelevant to the study's actual purposes, both of which are
achieved by the study itself. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of these is cuddling the alumni. "NOT a
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Donation Request--We Need Your Advice</ENAMEX>," read the outside of the survey envelope
sent to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alumni</ENAMEX>. True enough, there was no solicitation inside. But the survey
is nevertheless a marketing device, intended in small part to gather
information as part of planning the next big fund-raising <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">campaign</ENAMEX> and, in
large part, to create the feeling of ownership among an alienated alumni
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX>.

            The other purpose is cuddling the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>. And here
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McKinsey</ENAMEX> study has already paid off. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Students</ENAMEX> seem to feel that the mere
involvement of a management consulting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX> is an indication that the
administration cares more than they previously thought. Though some faculty
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> feel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McKinsey</ENAMEX>'s involvement shames the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">academy</ENAMEX>, most think it's a
healthy development for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professors</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard Law</ENAMEX>
School would recognize this as the placebo effect--if they had gone to medical
school as their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> really wanted.
