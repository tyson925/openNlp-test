               Stimulating
Answer
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Researchers</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dallas Zoo</ENAMEX> have been looking for
a scent that will encourage their ocelots to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">breed</ENAMEX>. "We thought about what
would work with them and used things like <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat feces</ENAMEX> and ocelot scent," says
research <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">curator Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cynthia Bennett</ENAMEX>. "Then on a lark my research <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">technician</ENAMEX>
brought in cologne because a lot of other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> like it and we put Obsession
out and our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ocelots</ENAMEX> went wild over it."

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bennett</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> isn't just doing this for kicks,
although I wouldn't put it past them, knowing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bennett</ENAMEX>, which I don't. They also
want to find a way to create "scent corridors" so that scattered packs of
ocelots, living in the wild, can find each other and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mate</ENAMEX>.

            Sponsoring a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">highway</ENAMEX> has
proved to be such a cheap and effective way for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporations</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">celebrities</ENAMEX> to
generate good will; maybe these same <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> could be encouraged to pony up for
<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a few miles</NUMEX> of scent corridor. I'm just blue-skying here, but wouldn't you feel
a lot better about your phone bill if you saw a sign that said something like,
"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Next Two Miles of Horny Ocelots Are Brought to You by Sprint"</ENAMEX>?
