                  Dear
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudence</ENAMEX>,
               
            

            
               My significant other
is driving me berserk. He changes religious beliefs like some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> change
clothes. This might be only peculiar (and therefore tolerable), but he expects
me to accompany him, as well as get into the philosophy of the moment. I really
do not have time for this and, to be truthful, do not share his passion for
religious theory. I gave it a try but can no longer play along. How would you
recommend I deal with this? (And him?)

            Dear Pull,

            Your trendy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> sounds like a handful. If you
are interested in maintaining the relationship, you need to spell out that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lovers</ENAMEX> need not share every interest, and that his searching for new belief
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX> is particularly tiring for you.

            It would be helpful if
you had a religion that you started with and said you wished to retain but,
failing that, tell the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">theologian</ENAMEX> that you are making a new beginning: that he
has your blessings, pardon the expression, to pursue the religion of his choice
... alone. If he throws it up to you that you used to go to all the various
services with him, tell him that was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zen</ENAMEX>, this is now.

                  Dear
Prudie,
               
            

            
               My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> is starting to make me wonder if she is mature enough to even be married.
She spends more time with her girlfriends, most of whom are from high school,
than she does with me. (We have no <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>.) I wind up doing many things alone
on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekends</TIMEX> and in the evenings because she always has plans with "the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX>."
My wish is to make this marriage work because I love my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>, but I am feeling
like <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> fiddle to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gang</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX>. Any ideas?
            

            

               --Stumped
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dear Stump</ENAMEX>,

            Do you know the saying, "We're all grown-ups here?"
Well, that seems not to be the case in your life. Your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> sounds immature to
the max. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudie</ENAMEX> is at a disadvantage, however, not knowing the details and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dynamics</ENAMEX> of your marriage.

            Just regarding the
complaint about reliance on girlfriends, though, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudie</ENAMEX> suggests you have a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">loooong</ENAMEX> and serious heart-to-heart with your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>, outlining your disturbance
with her choices. Ask if she wishes to be married. Ask if she has complaints
about you . If she is willing, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couples</ENAMEX> therapist might be helpful. One
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> or the other, you have to resolve the situation.

                  Dear
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudence</ENAMEX>,
               
            

            
               My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> was married once before my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> and
has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> from his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> marriage. I am <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>, and my stepbrothers are
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">their late 30s</TIMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">All three</NUMEX> are intelligent (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX>, one has an MBA)
but have never found themselves in stable situations. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">All three</NUMEX> have been
bankrupt at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> point during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past three years</TIMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">All three</NUMEX> apportion a great
deal of guilt to my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>, who did not win custody of them when they were
younger. Their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> was not a good one, and I recognize that they have
emotional scars. However, my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> never fails to bail them out of a financial
crisis. While my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> has done well, he is by no means wealthy. I know he has
dipped into his retirement fund several times to help my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">siblings</ENAMEX> out.
            

            
               What bothers me is
that while my childhood was far more "normal," I demonstrate more
responsibility in my financial obligations (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">school</ENAMEX> loans, etc.) than my elder
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">siblings</ENAMEX> and, frankly, would be embarrassed to ask my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> for money because
I couldn't get a handle on life. My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> came from a poor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> and I would
like him to enjoy his retirement. Is it appropriate for me to say anything to
him regarding this matter? I do love my elder <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sibs</ENAMEX> but feel they are exploiting
my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> with guilt.
            

            

               --<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Concerned</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">D.C.</ENAMEX>
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dear Con</ENAMEX>,

            It sounds as though you have your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>'s
well-being at heart, so you might gently engage him in a conversation about
your <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concerns</ENAMEX>. Do articulate that you do not feel competitive with your
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brothers</ENAMEX> and try to bring up the question of "making reparations" out of
guilt. Also mention that bailing out these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> may not be in their best
interests. He cannot help but be touched if you tell him of your <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concerns</ENAMEX> for
his comfortable retirement. He may be amenable to what you have to say--or he
may not. Once you've brought the subject up, however, know that you can take it
no further. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end</TIMEX>, it is his money ... and his guilt.

            It is admirable that you
regard responsibility in a different way than the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> you write about.
It is interesting, too, that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> and the MBA display financial
incompetence. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudie</ENAMEX> recommends, by the way, that you not bring up this subject
with your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brothers</ENAMEX>. That way lies fireworks.

                  Dear
Prudie,
               
            

            
               This is going back a
bit, but I was struck by the letter from . As a psychology <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX>, a
previous psych major, and an avocational <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">singer</ENAMEX>, I agree with your advice to
"Go for it" but think there's yet another option that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carpe</ENAMEX> should consider
before running away from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> or from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">college</ENAMEX>. Since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carpe</ENAMEX> is already enrolled
in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">college</ENAMEX>, why not take a minor in music or even double major in psychology
and music? Surely <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mom</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dad</ENAMEX> can't object to that, but more important, Carpe
has this wonderful opportunity to increase her musical skills, develop her
talent, and make important connections that could lead to jobs. Why not take
the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four years</TIMEX> to do all that and then "run away" to pursue her dreams, fully
prepared?
            

            
               --<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sincerely</ENAMEX>,

            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Dear One,</ENAMEX>

            Why not, indeed? What
you suggest is very sound advice, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudie</ENAMEX> thanks you for being a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudie</ENAMEX>.
