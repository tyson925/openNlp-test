Everything you need to know about <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gov.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George W. Bush</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>, you learned in
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">kindergarten</ENAMEX>. Launching his presidential campaign in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iowa</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this weekend</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>
outlined a threefold agenda: to impose "bad consequences for bad behavior" and
"love our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX> as we want to be loved ourselves"; to help <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">charities</ENAMEX> "to nurture, to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mentor</ENAMEX>, to comfort" <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in need; and to insist
that "every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> must be educated."

            A less
daring <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platform</ENAMEX> can scarcely be imagined. Yet the media lauded <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>'s speech
for its boldness, citing the "contrasts" he drew with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> while
"appealing to a different kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> from the one that had elected his
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>" and "distinguishing himself from the rest of the crowded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Republican</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">field</ENAMEX>." How does <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> pass off his clich√©s as confrontations? By fabricating
illusory distinctions and debates.

            

               <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. Compassionate conservatism. This is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>'s unofficial
slogan. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iowa</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Leach</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iowa</ENAMEX>, introduced <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> as "a
conservative with a conscience, with compassion." <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> used the word
"compassion" <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> times in his speech, concluding: "I know this approach has been
criticized. But why? Is compassion beneath us? Is mercy below us? Should our
party be led by someone who boasts of a hard heart? ... I'm proud to be a
compassionate conservative. I welcome the label. And on this ground I will make
my stand." The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX> applauded, and the press swooned. As the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>
Times described the scene: "Taking up a challenge from some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponents</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>
defended his philosophy of 'compassionate conservatism.' "

            How
does <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> spin compassion, the world's most universal value, as a courageous
"stand"? As with most magic tricks, the sleight of hand occurs at the outset,
when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> says his philosophy "has been criticized." In truth, none of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rivals</ENAMEX> has criticized compassion or boasted of a hard heart. On the contrary,
some call "compassionate conservatism" an offensive phrase because it suggests
that unmodified <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conservatives</ENAMEX> lack compassion (just as many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">liberals</ENAMEX> complained
that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Gore</ENAMEX>'s "practical idealism" implied that unmodified
idealists were impractical). Others dismiss this phrase as "weasel words"
designed to substitute for positions on specific issues. What <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponents</ENAMEX>
have "criticized," in short, is not his "approach" but its redundancy and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">insubstantiality</ENAMEX>. By conning the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> into reporting that he was "defending
his philosophy," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> snuffed out the real question: whether he has a
philosophy to defend.

            

               <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. Prosperity with a purpose. This is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>'s official campaign
theme. It's supposed to convey what he offers that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> doesn't. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> may have brought us prosperity, the slogan suggests, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> will give
our prosperity a purpose. And what is that purpose? According to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>: "<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>
must be prosperous so that anybody who wants to work can find a high quality,
high paying job. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> must be prosperous so that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> can realize their
entrepreneurial dreams. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> must be open so that every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizen</ENAMEX> knows the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">promise of America</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> must be educated so that all our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> can
realize the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> dream." In other words, the purpose of prosperity is ...
prosperity.

            

               <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. The responsibility era. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> doesn't talk about moral
issues that might get him into trouble, such as abortion or homosexuality.
Instead, he pledges "to usher in the responsibility era," in which we will
"confront illegitimacy," instill "discipline and love" in juvenile justice, and
accept that "we're responsible for our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> and helping in our
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX>." Lest anyone point out the abstractness and obviousness of these
commitments, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> says they stand in "stark contrast to the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last few decades</TIMEX>,
when our culture has clearly said, 'If it feels good, do it, and if you've got
a problem, blame somebody else.' " Does <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> really think the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last few decades</TIMEX>,
supervised in large part by his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX>, were the era of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">irresponsibility</ENAMEX>? Or is he painting a dark background to lend the illusion of
luster to his pale moral agenda?

            
Likewise, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> often uses sharp language to obscure fuzzy thought. "Some people
think it is inappropriate to draw a moral line in the sand. Not me," he
proclaims. And what is his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">line</ENAMEX>? "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Children</ENAMEX> must learn to say yes to
responsibility, yes to hard work, yes to honesty, and yes to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>." Likewise,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> asserts, "We must teach [our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>] there are ... wrong choices." Such
as? <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Drugs</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX>, and teen pregnancy, he says. And what's wrong with teen
pregnancy? It's "a sure-fire way to fall behind," he explains, using the
language not of a pulpit but of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Planned Parenthood</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinic</ENAMEX>.

            

               <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. New idealism. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iowa</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> elicited applause and media
excitement by taking what the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los Angeles Times</ENAMEX> called "several shots"
at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinton</ENAMEX>. "I will not use my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> as a mirror to reflect public opinion,"
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">declared Bush</ENAMEX>. "Government should not try to be all things to all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>." "I
do not run polls to tell me what to think." "We will show that politics, after
a time of tarnished ideals, can be higher and better. We will give our country
a fresh start after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a season</TIMEX> of cynicism." "<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> are waiting for new
hopes, new energy and new idealism."

            The
difference between an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">idealist</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cynic</ENAMEX>, in this view, is that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">idealist</ENAMEX>
is willing to take a stand contrary to public opinion. On taxes? <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> proposes
"to give <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> more money" in the name of "compassion." On special interest
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pork</ENAMEX>? He told <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Iowans</ENAMEX> he supports ethanol subsidies. On <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kosovo</ENAMEX>? He "welcomes"
the peace agreement but says "<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> should be suspicious" of it. On the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GOP</ENAMEX>'s
campaign against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Hormel</ENAMEX>, the gay <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> has appointed to be
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ambassador</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Luxembourg</ENAMEX>? <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> says that any qualified <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">appointee</ENAMEX> should be
allowed to serve but that he won't speak out against the campaign because
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hormel</ENAMEX> isn't conservative. On fiscal restraint? <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> says, "[A]fter we meet
priorities, when we have money left over, we must pass it back to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers</ENAMEX>." Note the caveat about "priorities." Sound familiar?

            Like
his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> substitutes virtue for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substance</ENAMEX>. When asked by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek</ENAMEX> what his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> stands for, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George W.</ENAMEX> answered, "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Honesty</ENAMEX>,
integrity, serving for the right reasons." And what are those reasons?
"<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>, and what <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">America</ENAMEX> stands for," he replied. "To bring integrity and
decency to the process and to serve for the right reason, which is country
above self. But I'm going to have a specific agenda that addresses what I think
are the big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concerns</ENAMEX> as we go into the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21 st century</TIMEX>." The younger
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>'s constant assurances that he's going to unveil his "<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>-point plans" and
"specific incentives" <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">any day</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">now</TIMEX>--a vague pledge to be specific--are the
functional equivalent of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>'s constant allusions to "vision." The less
you have of something, the more you boast of it abstractly.

            
               <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>. A uniter, not a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">divider</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>'s greatest feat has been to spin his evasion of
controversies as a virtue. "A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> must be a uniter, not a divider," he
declares. "This <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> is hungry for a new-style campaign" that is "positive,
hopeful, inclusive" and "unites <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>." With those words, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Republican</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">front-runner</ENAMEX> takes a bold stand against taking bold stands. Shame on lesser
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> who demand that he choose sides on the difficult issues of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX>.
He's in his own <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">league</ENAMEX>. And by selling the media distinctions without a
difference, he intends to keep it that way.
