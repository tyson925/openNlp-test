               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Randy</ENAMEX>'s Anecdotal
Wrap-Up
            

            Before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GE</ENAMEX> bought <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC</ENAMEX>, just outside each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">elevators</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Rockefeller Center</ENAMEX> was a direction sign listing each employee
who worked on that floor. It was exciting, albeit in a slightly childish way,
to see your name on that signboard, confirming that you still had your cushy
job in this historic broadcasting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">center</ENAMEX>. And the signs made it easier for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> to find their way around. After the takeover, one of the first hints
of the new corporate culture was the removal of all those convenient signs,
and--so the rumor went--the firing of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> whose job it was to keep them up
to date. As he went from floor to floor removing the signs, did he realize what
was going to happen after he'd taken down the final one?

            A little while later,
the "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">RCA Building</ENAMEX>" sign that had been on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Rock</ENAMEX> since its construction was
replaced with one reading "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GE Building</ENAMEX>," completing the eradication of the
individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX> and the rewriting of architectural history. Isn't this the
sort of thing we used to detest when the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviets</ENAMEX> did it? That, and replacing
all the hall lighting with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">40-watt</NUMEX> bulbs and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIRV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missiles</ENAMEX>?

Answer
            

            "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Our Goal: Total Customer Satisfaction</ENAMEX>"

            Says the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Economist</ENAMEX> , the popular business
fanzine: "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GE</ENAMEX> tops most polls as the world's most-admired <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">This year</TIMEX> it
may become the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX> to rack up net profits of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$10 billion</NUMEX>." Most people
still associate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GE</ENAMEX> with making things. (And with mass firings, polluting the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hudson</ENAMEX>, busting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unions</ENAMEX>, scary nuclear power <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>, scarier defense
contracting, and scariest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC</ENAMEX> twaddle-- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ed</ENAMEX>. ) In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1980</TIMEX>, manufacturing
provided <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">85 percent</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>'s profits; now <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three-quarters</NUMEX> come from
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">services</ENAMEX>. Around <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of that comes from its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> "pure" service <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GE</ENAMEX>
Capital, which alone provides <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 40 percent</NUMEX> of its profits, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC</ENAMEX>. (But
even as a service <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">provider</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GE</ENAMEX> will always be known for mass firings, polluting
the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hudson</ENAMEX>, busting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unions</ENAMEX>, scary nuclear power <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>, scarier defense
contracting, and scariest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twaddle.</TIMEX>-- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ed</ENAMEX>. )

            In addition to its shift from manufacturing to
service, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GE</ENAMEX> is changing from an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> into a truly international
operation. Again, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Economist</ENAMEX> : "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GE</ENAMEX> has redoubled attempts to pass
business to cheap hands and cheap minds. If you live in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> and get a strange
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">voice</ENAMEX> asking why your credit-card payment is late, it is probably because the
call is coming from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operators</ENAMEX> assume western names and reportedly
pick up the twang of the region they cover)."

            Servicing aircraft
engines in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wales</ENAMEX> embodies both these aspects of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GE</ENAMEX>'s new philosophy. No wonder
they're so admired. By the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Economist</ENAMEX> . The popular business fanzine not
known for its nude <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">CEO</ENAMEX> centerfolds.

            When I called to renew
my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Yorker</ENAMEX> subscription, I asked the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operator</ENAMEX> if she could offer me a
bargain. "Are you a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priest</ENAMEX>?" she asked. A special low rate is listed for
priests but not for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clergy</ENAMEX> of any other faith. Presumably, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cond√© Nast</ENAMEX> is
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">courting Catholic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clerics</ENAMEX> (coveted by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">advertisers</ENAMEX>?). "It's true at
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vogue</ENAMEX> , too," she said. "And if you're a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bishop</ENAMEX> or above, we'll actually
pay you to subscribe to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mademoiselle</ENAMEX> ," she did not add.

<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX>. He kept his head down and avoided eye contact. He pressed no flesh. He
was widely recognized, but it appeared he did not wish to be seen. Was it
because he was flying economy class? Because of his <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Mickey Mouse</ENAMEX>-logo polo
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">shirt</ENAMEX>? Did he pay for it, or was it baksheesh? Face it: He just doesn't seem
