               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Randy</ENAMEX>'s
Wrap-Up
            

            The most feared (in a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">good-natured</ENAMEX>, humorous way) teen news--other than the startlingly high number
of "your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> was killed in a car crash" (in a lighthearted, frolicsome
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX>)--was this: Your adolescent is enjoying sex and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>. This is a tricky
territory for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> who enjoy sex and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> and liberal politics. How do you
forbid the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> to practice what you, er, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">practice</ENAMEX>? The hypocrisy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buster</ENAMEX>?
Age-appropriate. There are many things that are permitted to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>--e.g.
driving a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>--that are not wrong in themselves, just wrong for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a 5-year-old</TIMEX>.
Once you get your adolescent to endorse this idea (and to forget that <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Juliet</ENAMEX>
was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">just 14</NUMEX>), you've won. The rest is just arguing over what age is the
threshold for each activity. Some suggestions:

            

               Drinking--<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX>, in accordance with the law of the land

               <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Dating--16</ENAMEX>, in accordance with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>' senile reminiscence

               <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Own Monkey--12</ENAMEX>, or whenever old enough to operate electro-stick

               Own <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Erotic Life</ENAMEX>--<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>, if attending college out of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX>, if living at
home

               Own Seat on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Jersey</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX>--<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>, or old enough to serve Gov.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christine Todd Whitman</ENAMEX>'s relentless ambition

            

            
               Slurred
Answer
            

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">caller</ENAMEX> told the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Glendenings</ENAMEX> that their
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Raymond</ENAMEX>, had just been arrested for drunken driving, in a
parking <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lot</ENAMEX>, at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2:30 a.m.</TIMEX> Most piquant detail: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frances Glendening</ENAMEX>'s assumption
that this is a universal experience.

            After giving the little
miscreant a sound thrashing, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> will throw <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Raymond</ENAMEX> out
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and disinherit him, or, if you choose to believe the pronouncement
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> befuddled by grief: "We will offer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Raymond</ENAMEX> our unconditional and
abiding love, support and guidance."
