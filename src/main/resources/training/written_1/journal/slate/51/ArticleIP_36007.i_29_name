            Dear
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David</ENAMEX>,

            Thanks for your speedy response. I found your
comments more interesting than your earlier ones, mainly because you
acknowledged liking some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> in the show. And that's good. I'm glad.
I was beginning to wonder whether you were a knee-jerk <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neo-conservative</ENAMEX>, which
is even worse than being a knee-jerk <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">liberal</ENAMEX>. (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Knee-jerk</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">liberals</ENAMEX> are at least
motivated by a desire for social <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">justice</ENAMEX>, while knee-jerk <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neo-conservatives</ENAMEX>
operate strictly out of fear--a fear of change; a fear of human instinct; a
fear, it often seems to me, of their own latent homosexuality.)

            Getting back to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chris Ofili</ENAMEX>: No, I do not think
that his inclusion of porn cutouts in the painting brands him as a rude
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">provocateur</ENAMEX>. Remember, the Virgin <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary</ENAMEX> may be a timeless <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">symbol</ENAMEX>, but she is
also a flesh-and-blood <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ofili</ENAMEX> is hardly the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX> to eroticize
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Virgin</ENAMEX>. It's been going on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least</TIMEX> since the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX>. (I'm sure you're
familiar with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leo Steinberg</ENAMEX>'s book on the subject.) Moreover, since you're a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">guy</ENAMEX>, I shouldn't have to tell you that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">virgins</ENAMEX> are sexy.

            Why do you speak of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sarah Lucas</ENAMEX> as nasty? I think
she's major. I loved <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Au Naturel</ENAMEX> , that bare mattress piece with the melon
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">breasts</ENAMEX> and erect <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cucumber</ENAMEX>. It manages to be both cultivated and raw at the
same time, which is basically what I look for in any work of art. The piece
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">evokes Rauschenberg</ENAMEX>'s famous painted Bed and might be seen as
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rauschenberg</ENAMEX>'s bed unmade.

            If we get away from the art <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stars</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hirst, Ofili</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">etc.</ENAMEX>) for a moment, I'd like to say that, for me, there were many small
discoveries in the show. For instance, I had never before seen <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mat Collishaw</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bullet Hole</ENAMEX> , and I found it totally engaging. As you know, it's a big,
lighted close-up of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> wound that bears an unsettling resemblance to an
anus, and when I saw it, I thought to myself, "That's the story of my life.
Half <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> asshole." Or, to be more elegant here (in keeping with the
spirit of your own mandarin replies), you might say that the piece subverts the
tradition of staged photography, blasting a hole through the cold, calculating
heart of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">'90s</NUMEX> art.

            I agree with you that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Simon Patterson</ENAMEX> is not the next <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Picasso</ENAMEX>, but so what? The <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Armory Show of 1913</ENAMEX>,
probably the last show in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> to cause this level of commotion, had its
share of duds as well. Let's concentrate on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> we like. There are lots
of first-rate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> in "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sensation</ENAMEX>," and I can't think of any other recent
show that captures so forcefully the particular feeling of being alive in the
'90s, which sometimes means feeling like you're dead (I loved <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ron Mueck</ENAMEX>'s
Dead <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dad</ENAMEX> ).

            Yours
truly,

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Deborah</ENAMEX>
