            An
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">article</ENAMEX> traces the similarities between <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edmund Morris</ENAMEX>'
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dutch</ENAMEX> and a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX> short story by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel Voll</ENAMEX>. In both works, a drowning
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">narrator</ENAMEX> is saved by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lifeguard</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald Reagan</ENAMEX>. Both narrators eroticize <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX>
and reveal their secret debt to him on the final page. … The cover book review scoffs at the misplaced sympathy for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Susan Faludi</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stiffed</ENAMEX> . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Faludi</ENAMEX>'s poorly written tome ignores "the
resurgence of male bravado," which is evident in the candidacy of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Trump</ENAMEX>
and the popularity of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howard Stern</ENAMEX>. Her assertion that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> have the upper
hand in the porn industry is laughable.

            The
cover story says that corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boards</ENAMEX> are firing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">CEOs</ENAMEX>
more often than they used to. Institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> insist upon sacking

damage their own reputations. … An editorial warns that the bombardment of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chechnya</ENAMEX> could
ignite a war in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caucasus</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Georgia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Azerbaijan</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Armenia</ENAMEX> are convulsed by

            The

shootings. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victim</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isaiah Shoels</ENAMEX> are suing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">killers</ENAMEX>'
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$250 million</NUMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shoelses</ENAMEX> have no sympathy for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">perpetrators</ENAMEX>'
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> because, as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Isaiah</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> says: "Who else do we blame? I taught my
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son right</ENAMEX> from wrong. My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> wasn't shooting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> up." <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Parents</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">West</ENAMEX>

the latest weight-loss trend (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atkins</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Sugar Busters, and Carb Addicts</ENAMEX> are the
best-known diets). Eating lots of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fatty meat</ENAMEX> and few carbs forces the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> to
meet its energy needs by burning fat. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dieters</ENAMEX> have lost weight, but
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> warn that low-carb, high-fat diets cause dehydration, constipation,

            The

prepare for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Revelation</ENAMEX>; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reformation</ENAMEX> was inspired by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin Luther</ENAMEX>'s

jobs <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than five years ago</TIMEX>. The piece attributes the

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> opposed the war but enlisted in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Army</ENAMEX>. After his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">service</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> lived
off his savings, lounged around a singles apartment <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>, and drank to
excess. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX>, by contrast, smoked pot, worked construction, attended divinity

<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Justice</ENAMEX> fueled conspiracy theories by limiting access to Waco evidence and

            The
cover story draws parallels between the rejection of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty</ENAMEX> and the impeachment crisis. Both issues were
driven by right-wing <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> over the opposition of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> are turning their backs on arms control because of the mistaken
