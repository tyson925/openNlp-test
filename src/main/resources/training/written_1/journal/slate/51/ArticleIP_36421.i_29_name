            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Captain's</ENAMEX> log: <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2100 hours</TIMEX>, underway in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atlantic Ocean</ENAMEX>. Forward is heaving hypnotically to the gentle ocean
swells as we glide beneath a canopy of brilliant points of starlight. The
evening watches are set--on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX>, combat information <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>, engineering
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">center</ENAMEX>, and communications <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">room</ENAMEX>; the smell of fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pastries</ENAMEX> from the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">galley</ENAMEX> is wafting throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ship</ENAMEX>. Most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crew</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">90</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and women
have settled in for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the evening</TIMEX>, taking advantage of a well-deserved lull in
activity. We are steaming northeast off the coast of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Uruguay</ENAMEX> in position <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX>
degrees south latitude and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">54 degrees</NUMEX> west longitude, which is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 2,100</NUMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">miles</NUMEX> south of the equator. It has been <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three months</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">nearly 13,000 miles</NUMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ocean</ENAMEX> since we've seen our homeport of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Portsmouth</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Va.</ENAMEX>; it's hard to believe
our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> are still in another hemisphere.

            While not always thrilling, shipboard life uniquely
blends tradition and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">customs</ENAMEX> with modern technology and comforts. For example,
as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">captain</ENAMEX>, I enjoy many of the perks traditionally offered in the early
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> of sail. I have my own <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cabin</ENAMEX> (which is the largest stateroom in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ship</ENAMEX>),
I'm saluted as I walk on and off the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX>, and when I speak, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> listen.
Flogging, I think, has been left off the modern perk list! In simple terms, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">buck</ENAMEX> stops with me. All actions and decisions are my responsibility--even if I
didn't make them. While my authority is absolute, so is my accountability; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">90</NUMEX>
lives depend on it. I can't think of too many job descriptions that carry
similar weight. I love my job, not because of personal gain, but for the
personal growth I see in my shipmates and for the service we provide our
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. I relayed a story to the crew <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one evening</TIMEX>: We were traveling down the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rio de la Plata River</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Buenos Aires</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Argentina</ENAMEX>, to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Montevideo</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Uruguay</ENAMEX>; the
river has a fairly narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> that required a navigational <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilot</ENAMEX> to assist
us during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the nine-hour</TIMEX> transit. After <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a few short hours</TIMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX>, the
river <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilot</ENAMEX> told me that I had a very well run and professional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crew</ENAMEX>; he went
on to say that is why "<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> is the No. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> country in the world." You can't
get much better than that.

            In the fast-paced, Internet-woven world we live in,
it's nice to take refuge in the simple aspects of being a sailor. I enjoy my
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning workouts</TIMEX> on the stationary bike in our helicopter <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hangar</ENAMEX>--ocean
sunrises are as close to heaven on earth as you can get. I like to see the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gleam</ENAMEX> in the eye of a young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> when she handles the ship well alongside
the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pier</ENAMEX>; mastering the effects of wind, tide, and current. I tell my wardroom
of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> to eat "<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">three</NUMEX> squares" a day--mealtime has always been an
important aspect of shipboard life, more for its social aspects than anything
else. Plus, I have many of them convinced that my sunny disposition is due to a
well-fed stomach. I still get chills when my most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">junior crewmembers</ENAMEX> snap sharp
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">salutes</ENAMEX> when I approach them on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX>. I can sense they are happy to
serve; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> is truly blessed with the young <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coast Guard</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> I have
the pleasure to serve with.

            Let me set the record <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">straight</TIMEX> before I leave you
with the illusion that life aboard a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coast Guard</ENAMEX> cutter is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> step removed
from a cruise <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">liner</ENAMEX>. A typical day underway is consumed with <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">eight hours</TIMEX> of
watches and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">eight hours</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ship</ENAMEX>'s work. There are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> to launch, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">helicopters</ENAMEX>
to land, training to conduct and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX> to shoot. Throw in your <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">three</NUMEX> squares and
you've got an hour and change of free time. This <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ship</ENAMEX> is alive <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">24 by 7</NUMEX>. When
the weather kicks up, fatigue accelerates tenfold: Your bones ache; stuff flies
loose; keeping a steady footing is hard work; sleep is nearly impossible. And
yet we persevere; it becomes personal--to weather a storm is one of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ultimate</ENAMEX> challenges of the sea; to see it calm from its fury is like emerging
from the dark side of the moon; euphoric moods erupt only to be outdone by the
euphoria of returning home.
