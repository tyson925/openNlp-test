hot-blooded hatreds, and stone-cold hearts." Who was describing

            Among his many
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">accomplishments</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX> was the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of the great <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Scot-bashers</ENAMEX>, elevating
a common <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrant</ENAMEX> prejudice to a wittier sort of anti-immigrant prejudice
and a way to tweak his great <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Boswell</ENAMEX>. Some examples, taken from
the delightful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Samuel</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson Sound Bite Page</ENAMEX> maintained by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Lynch</ENAMEX>.

            

               When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boswell</ENAMEX> boasted about his <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>'s landscape, saying it had many
noble prospects, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX> replied: "The noblest prospect which a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Scotchman</ENAMEX> ever
sees, is the high <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> that leads him to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX>!"


               "What <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enemy</ENAMEX> would invade <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Scotland</ENAMEX>, where there is nothing to be got?"


               At dinner, Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thrale</ENAMEX> expressed a wish to go and see <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Scotland</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Johnson</ENAMEX>:
"Seeing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Scotland</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madam</ENAMEX>, is only seeing a worse <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX>. It is seeing the
flower gradually fade away to the naked stalk. "

               Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arthur Lee</ENAMEX> mentioned some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scotch</ENAMEX> who had taken possession of a barren

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">barrenness</ENAMEX> is comparative. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scotch</ENAMEX> would not know it to be barren." Boswell:
"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Come</ENAMEX>, come, he is flattering the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>. You have now been in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Scotland</ENAMEX>, Sir,

Sir; <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meat</ENAMEX> and drink enough to give the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhabitants</ENAMEX> sufficient strength to run

Answer
            

            Each was the subject of a biography by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Mackay</ENAMEX>
that faced charges of plagiarism.

            The prolific <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Scottish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 100</NUMEX>
books, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mackay</ENAMEX> is accused of cribbing passages of his newest work, I Have Not
Yet <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Begun To Fight: A Life</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Paul Jones</ENAMEX> . Publication of this
biography of another Scottish-born subject, set for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next month</TIMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monthly</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Press</ENAMEX>, has been put off.

            "I am holding back distribution and getting an
independent evaluation," said <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">publisher</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morgan Entrekin</ENAMEX>. "Like I should have
done with that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jay McInerney</ENAMEX> rubbish," he did not add.

            While <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mackay</ENAMEX> acknowledges similarities between his
books and those from which he is accused of copying, he denies wrongdoing,
pointing out that "there are only a certain number of words in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">English</ENAMEX>
language."

            He does admit stealing
valuable proofs of stamps belonging to the crown when he worked at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum</ENAMEX> but notes that this was a long time ago. "This is something that
happened when I was a young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>. I've surely paid my price for youthful
folly."
