            Down the botanical
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">garden</ENAMEX>'s terraced slope
following where the path
led us among tagged specimens
assembled in neat plots
by family

and ecosystem, local <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> and exotics
--even a young sequoia
from my native <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>--
each with its skirt of shade
underneath

gathered close in the solstice <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midday</TIMEX> heat,
with sometimes a single leaf
in outline emerging from the tangled
mass of shadows cast
on the level dust,

its boundary describing the unique
silhouette peculiar
to its kind, and all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">leaves</ENAMEX> above
outspread, reveling
in the common sunshine ...

we strayed into a cool alcove, lingering
where the pharmacopeia
detained us--ephedra, belladonna,
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> small gray-barked tree
without a label,

a glossy red-orange globe on a long stem
smooth as a persimmon
suspended from a skinny branch
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> high, a tin sign
enameled white

hanging on a silver <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> beside it
with prim black lettering:
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VELENO    NON TOCCARE</ENAMEX>.
Further on, where the slope
flattens out

and widens as the field sweeps gently down
to meet the towering
medieval wall--a sprawling acre
of tall <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">grass</ENAMEX> and wildflowers,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">thistles</ENAMEX>, vines,

undifferentiated pagan <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">weeds</ENAMEX>
promiscuously nestled
against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">fortification</ENAMEX>'s brickwork,
the whole expanse of ground
let run wild

as if the circuit of the city wall
were a permeable membrane
admitting the wilderness inside,
wild and tame inter-
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">penetrating,</ENAMEX>

this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">trust</ENAMEX> in its identity
secure enough to allow
its opposite a place and share.
Just so, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitor</ENAMEX>
who climbs slowly

back from the outskirts along narrow lanes
of sun-warmed brick emerging
into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Il Campo</ENAMEX> senses the spreading
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">plaza</ENAMEX>'s vast expanse
widen around him

the way a mountain meadow greets a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hiker</ENAMEX>
in the wilderness who follows
the thin stripe of a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">trail</ENAMEX> through forest
shadows when suddenly
a clearing opens

and gathers him into the broad embrace
of high altitude
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cerulean</ENAMEX>. But ah, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Siena</ENAMEX>,
you are luckiest in the root
and stem whence

your hospitality <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>: each and all
your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> trust that within
the encircling shelter of your wall
they will always have a place
at the table, a bed.
