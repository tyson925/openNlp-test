               In a TV commercial running in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Houston</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> cover a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diane Keaton</ENAMEX>
look-alike in bubble wrap then roll her down a hill and through a sprinkler. We
don't find out what's being advertised until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end</TIMEX>, when the tag line comes
up. For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> points and the game: What is the tag line?

               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Randy</ENAMEX>'s Wrap-Up
            

            Many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News Quiz</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> suggest that the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">campaign</ENAMEX> is an ad for which we do not
know the product. Sure, this is cowardly, intellectually dishonest, and an
insult to the democratic process, but it's also thrifty, and that's important,
too. (Not important to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">G.W.</ENAMEX>, who enjoys <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scrooge McDuckian</ENAMEX> campaign funds, but
important in ways that will be revealed at the end. Of something.) As long as
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G.W.</ENAMEX>'s policies remain ambiguous, every TV ad is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stealth</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> ad. Any
commercial that features some kind of cool car driving through some kind of
perfect landscape implicitly says: Let <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">G.W.</ENAMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">driver</ENAMEX>) take the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> (the
car) into the future (it's just over the next fashion model). Or the ad when
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Wagnerian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soprano</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G.W.</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">spears</ENAMEX> (anti-missile <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">system</ENAMEX>) the cell phone (bad
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>?) of a discourteous opera <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fan</ENAMEX> (affirmative action? The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX>?): I
think that means he wants to cut taxes for his rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>. You can't be
overly literal. This thing works subconsciously, like workfare.

            
               Answer
            

            "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shop</ENAMEX> together, play together, eat together."

            The ad is for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mills Corp.</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10 th</NUMEX> and
newest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mall</ENAMEX>, each organized around the theme "total experience," by which is
meant a combination of shopping and entertainment, by which is meant a chance
to buy stuff at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Foot Locker</ENAMEX> and then play a video game. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">malls</ENAMEX> combine
discount shopping, high-tech amusement <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arcades</ENAMEX>, theme <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24-30</NUMEX>
screen multiplexes showing the same teen-sex comedies, but on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24-30</NUMEX>
screens.

            The reason we don't know
why they're being so mean to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diane Keaton</ENAMEX> until the end of the ad? "That was
very deliberate. The idea is to give a sense of intrigue that this is a new
type of experience," said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Parlota</ENAMEX>, executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> of the ad
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agency</ENAMEX> that produced the spot. "Of course, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> find out it's just
another crappy <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mall</ENAMEX>, they get pretty damn mad, but by then, I'm <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">miles</NUMEX> away," he
did not add.
