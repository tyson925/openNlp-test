"In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX>, the rule was well established that 'no lord could be sued by a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vassal</ENAMEX> in his own <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX>, but each petty lord was subject to suit in the courts
of a higher lord." This surprisingly relevant bit of medieval lore turns out to
be the philosophical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">foundation</ENAMEX> of what?

Wrap-Up
            

            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Massachusetts</ENAMEX>, just off <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">I-91</ENAMEX>, in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX>, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>, on the red
plastic screen that covers the urinal drain, were emblazoned these words: "Say
No <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">To Drugs</ENAMEX>." Oh yes--you are now meant to take in social policy while you
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">piss</ENAMEX>. But isn't this ubiquitous propagandizing what we mocked and derided when
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviets</ENAMEX> did it? (And by "we," I of course mean, me, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Orwell</ENAMEX>, and the
gang up at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Chiatt Day</TIMEX>.) Perhaps this was a subversive act, the
urinal-drain-guard <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX> inviting us to piss on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>'
failed drug policy. Is that still a legal form of protest? Like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Justice</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kennedy</ENAMEX>, I have only a tenuous grasp of constitutional law, but won't
this sort of thing be taboo once that flag-burning amendment passes?

            
               Articles of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Confederation Answer</ENAMEX>
            

            This is the legal underpinning of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Justice</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anthony</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kennedy</ENAMEX>'s nostalgic embrace of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>' rights.

            Writing the decision in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three 5</NUMEX>-4
cases that undermine the rights of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> to defend himself against a
state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kennedy</ENAMEX> argued that when a state violates a federal law, the
federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> can sue, but the individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victim</ENAMEX> cannot. "Our federalism
requires that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> treat the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> in a manner consistent with their
status as residuary sovereigns," he wrote, with a quill pen dipped in the blood
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Jefferson</ENAMEX>, or maybe it was a word processor.

            Writing the dissent,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Justice</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Souter</ENAMEX> argued that this goofball invocation of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> rights (Was
it "goofball"? No one has decent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">penmanship</ENAMEX> anymore.) leaves the individual
with little recourse when he's been wronged by sovereign <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Albany</ENAMEX> or that bastion
of liberty, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Harrisburg</ENAMEX>. Quoting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chief Justice</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Marshall</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Souter</ENAMEX> wrote: "If
he has a right, and that right has been violated, do the laws of his country
afford him a remedy? The very essence of civil liberty certainly consists in
the right of every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> to claim the protection of the laws when he
receives an injury."
