            If you haven't visited a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dentist</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past few</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of all, that's gross. (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Checkups</ENAMEX> are <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every six months</TIMEX>, and
don't pretend you forgot.) <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, be grateful that you have avoided the
"intra-oral camera." As the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dentist</ENAMEX> (or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assistant</ENAMEX>) navigates this horrifying
little gadget through the graveyard of your mouth, a color television magnifies
the florid pustulance of your gums and the puke-yellow dinge of your smile. A
harmless crevice in your <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">silver-mercury</ENAMEX> amalgam filling looks like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hell</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canyon</ENAMEX>. The microcracks in your enamel look like a broken window. All this can
be fixed, of course, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grand</ENAMEX> of straightening, filling, sealing, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">whitening</ENAMEX>. "You will agree to anything the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> they put that thing in
your mouth," says <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> recent victim of the camera. "You can't believe you are
walking around with that, that, that ick in your mouth."

            The transformation of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American dentistry</ENAMEX> from drill-and-fill to shoot-and-loot is an unlikely
business success story of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the '90s</TIMEX>, a case study in how a profession can work
itself out of a job and still prosper. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dentists</ENAMEX>, after all, are supposed to be
extinct by now. While they happily (and profitably) scraped teeth and filled
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cavities</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the '60s and '70s</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fluoride</ENAMEX> was quietly choking off their
revenue stream. The percentage of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> with cavities fell by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> and kept
falling. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> stopped going to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dentist</ENAMEX>, because they didn't need to. At
the same time, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> funded dental-school construction, spilling new
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dentists</ENAMEX> into a saturated market. Many found themselves cleaning teeth for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$10</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an hour</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mall</ENAMEX> clinics. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1984</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Forbes</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> forecast the end of
the profession. Only a few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lonely dentists</ENAMEX> would survive to fill the few
remaining cavities, the last vestiges of a once-great civilization on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Long</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Island</ENAMEX>.

            Instead, the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dentists</ENAMEX> has jumped <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 percent</NUMEX>, and
the average salary soared from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$76,000</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$124,000</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>. What
happened? In part, the oversupply of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dentists</ENAMEX> and the declining demand for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fillings</ENAMEX> forced the profession to change. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dentists</ENAMEX> had to become nicer and
visits less unpleasant. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marathon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Man</ENAMEX> has been replaced by Dr.
Soothe. "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> figured out pretty darn quickly that if you were an ass,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> would not come to you," says <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Hartel</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. Louis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dentist</ENAMEX>.
Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dentists</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> let you don virtual reality glasses and watch movies on
them. Others offer massage therapy and hot tubs. Does your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dentist</ENAMEX> have a
certificate of pain <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> on her <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wall</ENAMEX>? I bet she does.

            The most important
discovery <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dentists</ENAMEX> made was the endless vanity of aging <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby boomers</ENAMEX>. "We are
dealing now with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boomers</ENAMEX> who are the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">runners</ENAMEX> and the joggers and the
dieters, and they are very concerned with how they look," says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Dental</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Association</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Timothy Rose</ENAMEX>. Since going to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dentist</ENAMEX> was no
longer a necessary evil, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dentists</ENAMEX> made it an unnecessary pleasure. They allied
themselves with the self-improvement movement. "You still go for the needs, for
the cavity that has to get filled, but more and more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> ... come here to
feel better about themselves," says <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Friedman</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maryland</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dentist</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> used to be happy if they made it to old age with
enough choppers to chew. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boomers</ENAMEX>, lured by media images of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Great</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Smile</ENAMEX>, expect more. According to an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADA</ENAMEX> poll, the percentage of people
who are "very satisfied" with their teeth has dropped from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">57 percent</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46</NUMEX>
percent in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past decade</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dentists</ENAMEX> have learned to play on this vanity and
anxiety, encouraging dental care that is medically unnecessary but attractive
to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. "It's as if you went to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX> for a treatment for a disease
and he said you needed a nose job," says <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Dodes</ENAMEX>, author of Healthy
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Teeth: A User's Manual</ENAMEX> .

            To flog <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$500</NUMEX> teeth
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">whitenings</ENAMEX> and multi-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousand</NUMEX> dollar adult orthodontic treatments, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dentists</ENAMEX> run
computer simulations of your whitened, straightened teeth. Tooth color is
measured on a scale that starts at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A1</TIMEX>. "My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dentist</ENAMEX> showed me these disgusting
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">color</ENAMEX> charts and told me, 'You're an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A2</ENAMEX> now, but by the time you want to get
married you are going to be an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A4</TIMEX>. And no one wants to marry <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">an A4</TIMEX>,' "
says <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> who got her teeth bleached. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dentists</ENAMEX> also prod <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> to
replace perfectly functional gray-metal fillings with tooth-colored plastic
ones and to dump their solid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX> crowns for white <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">porcelain</ENAMEX>. Other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dentists</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sell</ENAMEX> the psychology of tooth appearance. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dentist</ENAMEX> specializing in porcelain
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">caps</ENAMEX> advises that male <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bosses</ENAMEX> with small teeth seem "weak."

            Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dentists</ENAMEX> dress up these cosmetic measures in medical
scare talk. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> of mine just quit a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dentist</ENAMEX> who was pressuring him to
whiten his teeth as a "preventive measure." (To prevent what? <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yellow</ENAMEX> teeth?)
Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dentists</ENAMEX> claim, without scientific evidence, that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mercury</ENAMEX> in amalgam
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fillings</ENAMEX> is dangerous. They urge <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> to replace the excellent amalgam with
plastic fillings at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> times the price.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dentists</ENAMEX> make a killing
on bad breath--or "halitosis," as they prefer to call it. Breath <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinics</ENAMEX> have
sprouted up all over the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> and are heavily advertised on the Web. They
terrify <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with a "halimeter," a new gadget that measures a nasty
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">smelling chemical</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methyl mercaptan</ENAMEX>. Armed with the halimeter proof, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dentist</ENAMEX> then dangles expensive mouthwashes and tongue scrapers in front of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>. Never mind that you can get the same results for free with careful
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">brushing</ENAMEX> and basic tongue-scraping. The machine makes the sale. "Now that there
is this machine that can document your complaint and can put a number on it, it
motivates a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> to actually do something about it. But the treatments
available now are the same ones that have been available for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15 years</TIMEX>," says
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hartel</ENAMEX>.

            Entrepreneurial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dentists</ENAMEX> market this elective care with
trained aggression. Dental management <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> often require their
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> to recite a quasisales script guiding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> toward profitable
cosmetics. Ads in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal of the American Dental Association</ENAMEX> and on
the Web promote tapes and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX> on marketing techniques. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> I know
quit his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dentist</ENAMEX> when he spied a pamphlet in the office instructing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dentist</ENAMEX>
in how to get his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> to "trade up" to more expensive treatment. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADA</ENAMEX>'s
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> conference is overflowing with seminars on topics such as "how to move
your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> to 'yes.' "

            The industry calls this
technique "treatment acceptance," a marvelous euphemism for parting you from
your money. According to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADA</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journal</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADA</ENAMEX> conference will
include an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all-day</TIMEX> "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treatment Acceptance</ENAMEX>" seminar "for the dental <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> that is
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fed</ENAMEX> up with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> accepting only what insurance covers or asking for
alternative cheaper treatment plans. Involve the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> in creating the
strategies for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> to accept optimum care."

            This hard sell is critical in dentistry in a way that it
isn't in other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX> because of the profession's brutal economics. Dental
insurance covers only <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">44 percent</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> (compared to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 80 percent</NUMEX>
for health insurance), and provides skimpy coverage for those who do have it.
As a result, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> pay most dental costs--<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 60 percent</NUMEX> of them--out of
their own pockets. Dental care is just another way to spend discretionary
income, competing with a vacation or a new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dentists</ENAMEX> have to make patients
want adult orthodontics in a way <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> don't have to make patients
want a quadruple bypass.

            It's tempting to dismiss
the whole industry as a scam, particularly when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dentists</ENAMEX> keep coming up with
new ailments such as bruxism (teeth grinding), periodontal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">malocclusion</ENAMEX> (bad bite), and microcracks. But these ailments are real, and our
awareness of them shows how far dentistry has come. A <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">generation ago</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dentists</ENAMEX>
filled teeth and cast dentures because that's all they knew. Decay killed so
many teeth that fancier problems seldom arose. Since then, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> have
studied bonding, implants, and periodontal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dentists</ENAMEX> can now make
crowns that last forever, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridges</ENAMEX> that stay anchored, dentures that behave
almost like real teeth. A <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">generation ago</TIMEX>, implants were a joke. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX>'s
implants, affixed to your jawbone by a titanium screw, can hold for the rest of
your life.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Scientists</ENAMEX> have learned how <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> can build up in gaps
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gum</ENAMEX>, cause infection, weaken the jawbone, and eventually murder teeth.
New research links these periodontal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart disease</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>, low
birth-weight <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">babies</ENAMEX>, and other nastiness you'd expect from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> running
wild in the bloodstream. This is why your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dentist</ENAMEX> hectors you to rubber-tip
your gums, brush with a superconcentrated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fluoride toothpaste</ENAMEX>, and wear a night
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">guard</ENAMEX> to control your bruxing (which loosens teeth, opening pockets between
teeth and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gum</ENAMEX>, etc.). It's also why your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dentist</ENAMEX> may bully you into <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gum</ENAMEX>
surgery. It all seems unpleasant and slightly absurd--the night <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guard</ENAMEX> is "an
excellent form of birth control," as one <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wearer</ENAMEX> puts it--but the alternative is
losing your teeth at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX>, getting dentures, and gumming your <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dentistry</ENAMEX> is
a hassle now because it works.

            "If you think back a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX>, it was considered inevitable that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> would lose
their teeth when they reached midlife. Around <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">40 or 45</TIMEX>, you would have your
teeth taken out. Periodontal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> was not understood, and decay was rampant.
But now teeth are resistant to decay and are lasting a lifetime. I have gone in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18 years</TIMEX> from learning how to make dentures and thinking it is OK for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to
lose teeth to being appalled if anyone loses teeth. It is a failure," says Dr.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judith Penski</ENAMEX>, my own fabulous <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">D.C.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dentist</ENAMEX>.

            Which brings us to the irony of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dentistry</ENAMEX>'s comeback: Just
as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> love the dental care they should suspect, they resent the care they
should appreciate. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aesthetic dentistry</ENAMEX> is the most profitable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> of the
business because it is an easy sell. Put a camera in your mouth and you'll want
whiter teeth, too. It is much harder to convince someone to poke her gums every
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> with a piece of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rubber</ENAMEX>, to sleep with a choking plastic tooth <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guard</ENAMEX>, and
to undergo <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> surgeries to fix a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gum</ENAMEX> flap, all for a benefit that is decades
away. The very success of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dentistry</ENAMEX> has raised expectations so high that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> now object to any inconvenience. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">under 60</TIMEX> believe keeping
all their teeth is an entitlement: Telling them they need <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gum</ENAMEX> surgery to
preserve their teeth makes them angry, not grateful--even though those teeth
would have been goners <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20 years ago</TIMEX>.

            When I surveyed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> and acquaintances about
their dental complaints, few bitched about cosmetic dentistry that was foisted
on them. They like their whiter, straighter teeth. No, they griped about the
medically advisable treatments that their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dentists</ENAMEX> prescribed, especially <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gum</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">surgeries</ENAMEX> and mouth <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guards</ENAMEX>. Pity the poor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dentist</ENAMEX> who abjures cosmetic
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dentistry</ENAMEX> but vigorously protects <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>' teeth. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> don't like
periodontal treatment, so they suspect it's a rip-off. This could not be
further from the truth.

            "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dentists</ENAMEX> are aware of providing what patients
want," says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hartel</ENAMEX>. "I had a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> come in with a terrible toothache. She
needed a root <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canal</ENAMEX>, but she did not want it. But she did want her teeth
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bleached</ENAMEX>, and she paid cash for it."

            Such is the triumph of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dentists</ENAMEX>: If they
can't sell you what you need, they'll sell you what you want.
