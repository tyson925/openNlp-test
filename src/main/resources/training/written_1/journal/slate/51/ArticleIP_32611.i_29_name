               The current issue
of a national <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> lists these warning signs: stain, unusual odor, the
sound of broken glass or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plastic</ENAMEX>. What <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publication</ENAMEX>, what danger? (Question

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pope John Paul II</ENAMEX> opted to fast-track her canonization, waiving the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five-year</TIMEX>
post-death waiting period. Beatification, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step toward sainthood,
requires a confirmed miracle, and one has already been "authenticated." Name
that miracle.

               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Randy</ENAMEX>'s Wrap-Up
            

            Something happened
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1968</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 minutes ago</TIMEX> that transformed the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> flag from
hallowed symbol to fabric pattern. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thirty years ago</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX> would not televise
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abbie Hoffman</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> flag shirt on the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dick Cavett Show</ENAMEX> ; last week
it was available at a street fair in my neighborhood in the form of silk
underwear. (Surprisingly comfortable.) This seems like increasing liberalism,
but it's only encroaching commerce, less a commitment to free speech than a
determination to sell paper plates, cups, and napkins for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">kicky Fourth of July</TIMEX>
fun. Similarly, if more slowly, the term "miracle" has evolved from sacred
mystery to a substitute for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mayonnaise</ENAMEX>. There is the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Miracle Mile</ENAMEX> for shopping,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Miracle</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ice</TIMEX> for sports, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miracle-Gro</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>. But here it seems less a
chance to make a buck than something akin to grade inflation. Either way,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mother Teresa</ENAMEX> is a shoo-in. And she'll look great on a medallion, boxers, or
briefs.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wondrous Answer</ENAMEX>
            

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">miracles</ENAMEX> have already been attributed to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mother Teresa</ENAMEX>, and the investigation has just begun.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry D'Souza</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">archbishop</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calcutta</ENAMEX>, said a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Bengal</ENAMEX> claimed that a tumor disappeared after he was blessed by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mother Teresa</ENAMEX>. D'Souza said the case has been authenticated by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX>.

            A <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> who broke
several ribs in a car accident reportedly healed when she wore a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mother Teresa</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">medallion</ENAMEX> around her neck.

            A <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Palestinian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> suffering from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> says she
was cured after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mother Teresa</ENAMEX> appeared in her dreams and said, "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Child</ENAMEX>, you are
cured."

            It does not count
against Mother <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Teresa</ENAMEX> that she's concentrated all her miracles into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> field,
medicine, failing to appear well-rounded. It does count against your <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HMO</ENAMEX> that
they are unlikely to provide any of these valuable services.

            Near where I used to live in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australia</ENAMEX>, there is a
road along the bottom of a cliff where a series of signs says:

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FALLING ROCKS</ENAMEX>

            DO NOT STOP

            Driving past, we used to
comment, "Damn right they don't."

            Apparently <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeff Newman</ENAMEX>
has taken too much <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX>, since <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Homer</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Odyssey</ENAMEX> is written in ancient
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>. (P.S.: On the subject of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglophone</ENAMEX> spelling, somebody should inform the
Greeks that they've misspelled <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX> "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hellas</ENAMEX>.")

            I don't know about your
'hood, but here, the prettier the car the more likely it is to be "keyed"--that
nasty, deep, full-length scratch (or scratches, if it is keyed by multiple
pissed-off proletarians) when one's <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> is parked on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>. Also, in a
sort of tribal downsizing, budding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gangsters</ENAMEX> no longer have to steal your car
radio, they only have to steal the brand logo insignia from the hood or trunk
of your <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> (less likely to set off the alarm, which makes it more likely that
they can steal badges from all <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> on a block) in order to prove their
inherent gangsterness. With all these options, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spray</ENAMEX>-paint-wielding taggers are
free to concentrate on the stationary objects that will mark their turf, or to
defile the stationary objects in the turf of the other.
