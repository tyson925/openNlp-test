            The
cover story complains about the pathologizing of normal

public hysteria with slogans such as "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Imagine Being Allergic to People</ENAMEX>." If

the gender-specific coaching strategy of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> women's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX>. Assuming that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> internalize tough criticism, the male <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coach</ENAMEX> tried positive reinforcement
instead. He tacked inspirational quotes to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX>' doors, emphasized what each
