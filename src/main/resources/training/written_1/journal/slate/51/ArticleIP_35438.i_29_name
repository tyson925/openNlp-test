Wrap-Up
            

            If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News Quiz</ENAMEX> responses
are any guide to popular taste--a ludicrous proposition, but play along--the
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> most greedy and lustful and savage realms are <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">backstage</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miss America</ENAMEX>
pageant and inside <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pat Buchanan</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX>. So here's my pitch to whomever replaces
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jamie Tarses</ENAMEX> (and I pray it will be well reviewed by whomever replaces <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Janet</ENAMEX>
Maslin, even though she reviews movies not TV shows). Beauty-contest time
travel: like the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesse Owens</ENAMEX> story but in heels and with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">virgins</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1936</TIMEX>.
Miss <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Universe</ENAMEX> contest. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">finalists</ENAMEX> with any kind of a shot are Miss
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>--a surprisingly leggy <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pat Buchanan</ENAMEX>--and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Miss Germany</ENAMEX>--an unexpectedly
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">amiable Adolf Hitler</ENAMEX>. During the swimsuit competition, while helping <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hitler</ENAMEX>
glue his modest <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-piece to his modest ass, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buchanan</ENAMEX> learns that his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">rival</ENAMEX> is
a pretty nice <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> who wants to do no more than conquer <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> and kill all the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX>. Not such a terrible thing, thinks <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buchanan</ENAMEX>, and certainly nothing to
start a war over. So <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX> is avoided, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of lives--you know, the
right sort of lives--are saved, and history is transformed in ways so utopian,
you'd never recognize the present. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> small <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX>: high-speed maglev trains

new world. Bold new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX>. (Did I mention that in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the second season</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buchanan</ENAMEX>
travels back in time to kill <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lincoln</ENAMEX> even deader? After a romantic interlude? A
three-way with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jefferson Davis</ENAMEX>?)

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> was describing the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20 th century</TIMEX>. Apparently he doesn't like it. Or, more disturbingly,
does.

            Addressing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.N.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Assembly</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> moved beyond vague generalities and into
comforting platitudes as he discussed poverty (against it), health care for all
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> (for it), and outbreaks of widespread killing (should do something to
stop them). Courting opprobrium, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> raised the touchy issue of
weapons of mass destruction and bravely declared that it would be bad if they
were used.
