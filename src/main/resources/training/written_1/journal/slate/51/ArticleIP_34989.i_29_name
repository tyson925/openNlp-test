            <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Twelve</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX> I worked at a small, left-leaning <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">think tank</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York City</ENAMEX>. As the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX> presidential primary election approached, we thought the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> might want
to differentiate between the various <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX>. So we drew up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> questions,
covering everything from reflagging oil <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">tankers</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Persian Gulf</ENAMEX> (a hot
issue at the time) to gay and lesbian rights.

            We
then mailed letters to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">the dozen or so</NUMEX> declared <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> from both parties
and requested position statements from their campaigns. We deliberately cc'd
the issues <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX>, figuring that this clever move would expedite the
responses. It didn't. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> practically ignored us. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX> had
to be wooed, cajoled, and mildly threatened before they coughed up their
answers. Ultimately, we printed a decent-sized booklet and sold several
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousand</NUMEX> copies at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$10</NUMEX> apiece. It was a modest contribution to the cause of an
informed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">electorate</ENAMEX>, and it yielded an equally modest return on the investment
of our <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> or so hard-worked <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX>.

            Today
it would take just <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a couple of hours</TIMEX> for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> with a Web connection and a
printer to produce a similar document for the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> presidential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">race</ENAMEX>. Each of
the declared presidential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> maintains a sophisticated Web site that
details positions on a wide range of critical issues. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Granted</ENAMEX>, if you visit
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://gopatgo2000.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">org,</ENAMEX>
click on "Issues," and read <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pat Buchanan</ENAMEX>'s statement on the environment, you
may find the air a bit thin. But this is presidential politics, and vague
positions are hardly unique to cyberspace.)

            As
with other areas of the Net, e-mail is the great connector. Any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">campaign</ENAMEX> can
now take a press release that at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time would have gone to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a few dozen</NUMEX>
political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX> and e-mail it to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tens of thousands</NUMEX>, even <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX>, of
Internet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">users</ENAMEX>. That remarkable development helps to bind a portion of the
electorate more tightly to the campaigns. But we're still talking about a press
release, and any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> will tell you that the value of such releases is
inversely proportional to the volume received.

            That's
just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> illustration of how the Net's contributions to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Democracy</ENAMEX>
remains nascent and hard to define. While the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> campaign will be the first
presidential contest in which the Web plays a significant role, it is unclear
how profound that role will be (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacob Weisberg</ENAMEX>'s accompanying piece,
"").

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">premises</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Standard</ENAMEX> is that the Internet has seeped into and
changed every important business in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>--and will soon have the
same effect around the world. Politics is not exempt. Although it's all too
often overlooked as a business, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> politics is a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">multibillion-dollar</NUMEX>
industry that employs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX>. So it's the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Standard</ENAMEX> 's job to cover how
the Internet will shape it. And that's the mandate for our once-a-week
contribution to "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Net Election</ENAMEX>."

            
               Politics

               <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Meets E-</ENAMEX>commerce
            

            What
does politics-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as</NUMEX>-Net-business mean? In the most salient case, campaigns
themselves are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX> (albeit short-lived ones that cannot legally make a
profit). As of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-July</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than six months</TIMEX> before anyone could cast a vote
for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Bradley</ENAMEX>, the former basketball <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">star</ENAMEX> had raised <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $240,000</NUMEX>
through his Web site. That's <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only about 2 percent</NUMEX> of his contributions. But the
site wasn't operational until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January</TIMEX>. Moreover, it wasn't until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June</TIMEX> that the
federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> said it would match online credit card contributions with
public funds, just as it matches money raised the old-fashioned way. With that
decision, every campaign has been rethinking its Internet fund-raising
strategies. We'll be closely examining their renewed efforts.

            One
question that leaps to mind is, "Are there viable forms of e-commerce that play
off of a political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX>?" To date, the answer is essentially no. Sure, you
can connect to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arizona Democratic Party</ENAMEX>'s online gift <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop</ENAMEX>. But
how many donkey <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Beanie Babies</ENAMEX> do you think have been sold there? <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eBay</ENAMEX> is not
yet disturbed.

            Still,
the tip of political e-commerce is beginning to poke up through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Web</ENAMEX>'s
surface. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gov.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George W. Bush</ENAMEX> tried to quash the parody site
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gwbush</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX>, saying
infamously, "There ought to be limits to freedom." The result? The site got <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">million</NUMEX> hits in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a month</TIMEX>. Net logic holds that eyeballs equal dollars, and sure
enough the controversial site was soon peddling T-shirts and bumper stickers
featuring <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>'s quote. Another site looking to cash in on the campaign is
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">www.</ENAMEX>gore2000.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">com</ENAMEX> . It's not officially affiliated with the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> campaign, but the site sells a wide array of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">paraphernalia</ENAMEX>--everything from buttons to gourmet <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX>. And it gives a
package of free collectibles to any <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Webmaster</ENAMEX> who picks up its banner.

            
               Online

               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Advertising Gets Political</ENAMEX>
            

            The
Internet has already begun to transform the general advertising industry, and
it will soon hold sway over <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">the tens of millions of dollars</NUMEX> spent every
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electoral</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX> on television and radio ads. Web advertising holds the strange
position of being almost entirely unregulated. Fraud and defamation laws
presumably apply to Net advertising, just as they do to all advertising. But
the specific sections of communications law that constrain political speech in
the electronic media--including provisions for equal time for all
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX>--do not apply to the Internet.

            
Consider how such loopholes can alter the electronic media landscape: Each
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">weekday</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Forbes</ENAMEX> records a brief commentary about his pertinent issues.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Forbes</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">campaign</ENAMEX> claims that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 160</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stations</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> "carry"
this commentary. (Just because they carry it, of course, doesn't mean they
actually play it <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> times a week.) According to federal regulations,
beginning <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45 days</TIMEX> before a primary, any radio station that carries a prepared
audio message from a presidential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> is required to give equal time to
any other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> who requests it. As a practical matter, most radio stations
in that situation would simply drop the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Forbes</ENAMEX> editorials. But his Web site can
continue to pump out a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Netcast</ENAMEX> with no interference.

            
Changes like these should spur "Net piggybacking" throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">2000</ENAMEX> race.
Here's how it works: Say a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> is adamantly opposed to any form of new
taxes, regardless of whether they are advocated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">opponent</ENAMEX>. So the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate crafts</ENAMEX> a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15-second</TIMEX> TV spot that does not directly attack her opponent
but warns <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewers</ENAMEX> of an ominous, high-tax future and instructs them to punch up
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nonewtaxes</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX>, where they'll find a complete history of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">opponent</ENAMEX>'s
record on taxation. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Viewers</ENAMEX> might be asked to fill out petitions with their ZIP
codes and e-mail addresses, which would be used to alert them to the ad's next
installment. These techniques have already been used in a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> and
congressional campaigns.

            Finally, we'll also be
watching the Net polling, Net focus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Net</ENAMEX> organizing that follow the
flow of money around an election. Our goal, shared with editorial partner

                  Slate
               , is to capture the way the unfolding <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> presidential race
looks from the Web. Whether you're a political junkie or not, we hope you'll
find Net Election informative, enlightening, and fun. At least, as much fun as
presidential politics will allow.
