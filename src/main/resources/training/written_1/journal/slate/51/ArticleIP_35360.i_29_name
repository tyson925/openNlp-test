            Why,
like a regretful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>,
unchained ghost, do I hover
over old photos when I'm home
for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thanksgiving</TIMEX>,
as if I'd all along been living

            behind
this time-lapse looking glass
I like to think of as my past.
Like to? But I was there, that's me
threading the hook with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worm</ENAMEX>,
me feeding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cake</ENAMEX> off a knife to a groom

            so
sweetly, as if he were my own.
He was! <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Numb</ENAMEX> as a new clone,
I stare--she does--stunned, stunned:
she, to see that I appear
alone; me, to see her there

            
without a clue to what's all wrong
with the picture. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glaring</ENAMEX>, then gone
by the album's final blank pages,
what was missing or too much
there. I seem to need to catch

            a
spark of knowing in that eye,
opaque as a grape. She thinks I
will approve, imagines me the anti-
climactic aging <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">matron</ENAMEX> of her
future: a beaming, wistful blur.

            I
am a blur. At least I'm not
what any camera I know has caught.
In albums, on walls, on the fridges
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>, you can easily see it.
I've modeled myself like clothes that don't fit.

            If you
knew me you'd want <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">seconds</TIMEX>--
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">twins</ENAMEX>, quintuplets! There must be records
of my self-most self. Who knows?
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> may classify the files
holding one of my rare true smiles.

            If
only I could blow up corners
of snapshots taken by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreigners</ENAMEX>
where I have candidly intruded:
say at sunset, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nantucket</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pier</ENAMEX>,
blocking a darling <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Arsenio</ENAMEX>'s ear

            Or
side by side with a Yoshiko
at Pagsanjan! There I know
the truth of who I am and was
would coincide. Me with my mother
laughing beside some <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sasha</ENAMEX> or other

            in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX>. Me with a serious smile
on a bench in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philadelphia</ENAMEX>, while
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolfgang</ENAMEX> cavorts in the foreground
with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helga</ENAMEX>--photos to confirm
glimpses of being that conform

            to the
credible evolution of what's
really become of me. So what
if all the negatives are lost?
I know they are out there, fading
somewhere, my hairdo and dress outdating,

            but not my earnest,
softened gaze
as one of your hands touched my face
and our <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> shadows between us
fused darkly in the piazza at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">noon</TIMEX>
just beyond <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dieter or Hans</ENAMEX>, that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June</TIMEX>.
