cover book excerpt, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Angela</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Ashes author</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank McCourt</ENAMEX> recounts his
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> as a public-school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX>. McCourt captured the imagination of his
rambunctious class by having them transcribe essays written by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> a
generation <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX>. ... An article introduces the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> of

<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SAT</ENAMEX> scores on the basis of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX>'s socio-economic and racial background
threatens meritocracy. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> piece argues that "striver" scoring is a rational
statistical tool for achieving the worthy goal of admitting more non-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asian</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minorities</ENAMEX> to elite <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">colleges</ENAMEX>. An opposing opinion claims striver scoring would
entrench the fallacy that "demography is destiny." ... A piece assesses <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George W. Bush</ENAMEX>'s foreign policy,
arguing that he covers up his ignorance of foreign affairs by deferring to

            A
special issue focuses on new ideas for drug reform. An article redefines drug abuse as a public health problem.
Treatment on demand and the abolition of criminal penalties for nonviolent
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> is the solution. ... A piece deems drug <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX> a cheap and
promising approach to rehabilitating <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">addicts</ENAMEX>. Nonviolent drug <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">offenders</ENAMEX> can
avoid <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prison</ENAMEX> sentences by undergoing treatment and monitoring. ... A
pharmaceutical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> is promoting a prescription alternative to medical
marijuana, according to a story . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marinol</ENAMEX> controls <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">nausea</ENAMEX> and appetite loss, the same
symptoms that lead <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> to smoke pot. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX>'s minions are
loudly opposing marijuana legalization to improve the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pill</ENAMEX>'s sales.

the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prisoners</ENAMEX> employed by private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> for a fraction of the

            The
cover excerpt from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Susan Faludi</ENAMEX>'s much-ballyhooed book says
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> have been emasculated by feminism and the new economy. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Men</ENAMEX> should learn to
replace media-manufactured masculine ideals that emphasize appearance and
dominance with ungendered ideals of social responsibility and liberty.
... A profile slaps <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Bradley</ENAMEX> for hypocrisy. He
fund-raises madly while assailing the role of money in politics, and he attacks
finger-in-the-wind politics even though he spent <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times more on polling
than any other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> during his last <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> campaign. ... In an

            An

transmission of the papilloma virus, the most common sexually transmitted
<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. Papilloma causes <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95 percent</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cervical cancer</ENAMEX>,
and pap smears miss <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">up to 40 percent</NUMEX> of infections. New <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> tests may help
detect the virus, but there is no treatment. A <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine</ENAMEX> is needed. ... A
profile of comedy icon <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Pryor</ENAMEX> salutes his transgressive artistry. Unlike
earlier black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">comedians</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pryor</ENAMEX> never tried to ingratiate himself with white
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audiences</ENAMEX> or cloak his rage.

            The

of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George W. Bush</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John McCain</ENAMEX> represent a coherent governing philosophy for
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GOP</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> wants to revive citizenship through energetic local government
and strengthened neighborhood <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain</ENAMEX> promises to fight cynicism
by reforming campaign finance and embracing a broader role for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> abroad.
... An article cudgels the claim that there is a farm crisis. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agriculture</ENAMEX> is triumphant, growing more than ever and growing it more cheaply.
Even though free-market farming kills family <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">farms</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> cannot afford to
prop up unprofitable agricultural <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX>.
