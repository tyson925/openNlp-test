            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudie</ENAMEX> has received a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">flood</ENAMEX>, you should pardon the expression, of correspondence in response to the .
The volume of mail was astounding. Following is a fair sampling from the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">deluge</ENAMEX>, with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudie</ENAMEX>'s thoughts at the end.

            
               
                  Dear
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudence</ENAMEX>,
               
            

            
               I am dismayed at your answer to the query about
using the handicapped <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stall</ENAMEX> in a public <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bathroom</ENAMEX>. I use a wheelchair. I cannot
begin to tell you how many times I have entered a public <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> to find the
ONLY stall occupied is the handicapped one--and by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> who did not need
it! The large size is not because we are "deserving of such amenities," but
because <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in wheelchairs need the space to turn around, to clamber onto
the toilet, to empty catheters, whatever. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> such as myself cannot get up
from the seat in a conventional <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stall</ENAMEX> without handrails.
            

            
               I have seen people
use them with their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>--waiting until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two or three toddlers</TIMEX> "make <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pee-pee</ENAMEX>."
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> sometimes use them to change clothes! This means I sometimes soil
myself. If there are NO other empty <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stalls</ENAMEX> and you gotta go, then, by all
means, use them--but never if there are other stalls you can use.

               How clueless!!! Here we have an able-bodied, selfish <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">caffeine addict</ENAMEX>, who
can't seem to wait for a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stall</ENAMEX>, callously making someone who is handicapped
wait. What will it take--seeing a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> standing in a puddle--or worse--before
you realize that you're a doofus?

                  Dear
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudence</ENAMEX>,
               
            

            
               I felt the need to
respond to this. I don't know how many times I have gone to use the handicapped
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stall</ENAMEX> and there's always someone in it. If there isn't another <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stall</ENAMEX> open, I
understand. However, the comment I object to is the one where you say there is
never a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">handicapped person</ENAMEX> waiting to use it when you are done. There are many
conditions that are not visible. I have <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">MS</ENAMEX> and look just fine. What is not
apparent is that I have a bladder problem and a catheter. For me to deal with
this is almost impossible in a "standard" <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stall</ENAMEX>.
            

            
               --<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sincerely</ENAMEX>,
            

            
               Me
            

            
               You dropped the ball big time in your response
to "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Doubting</ENAMEX>," about the able-bodied using <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stalls</ENAMEX> for the disabled. Let me
enlighten you: Almost every time I need to use the disabled stall (I am in a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">wheelchair</ENAMEX>), I have to wait for an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AB</ENAMEX> to leave, and they all apologize meekly
when they leave. Your insensitivity is truly astounding. What you consider
luxurious is a necessity to us. I suggest that you try holding your bladder or
bowels, race to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bathroom</ENAMEX>, and find the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ONE</NUMEX> stall you can possibly use
occupied by someone who prefers the "luxury" of the handicapped <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stall</ENAMEX>. Please
reconsider your opinion.
            

            
               Thank you.

                  Dear
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudence</ENAMEX>,
               
            

            
               Sorry to inform you
that in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> it is a finable offense to use a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">handicapped</ENAMEX>-designated
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">restroom stall</ENAMEX> if you're able-bodied. The fine for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">offense</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$271</NUMEX>. I
was riding my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bicycle</ENAMEX> on the state beach at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Huntington Beach</ENAMEX> and was arrested
and given a ticket, which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> has upheld--in the winter the beach
maintenance closes all but the handicapped <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX>, so I guess you are
supposed to use the landscape.

                  Dear
Prudie,
               
            

            
               The article on use
of the handicapped <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stall</ENAMEX> was a farce. You basically said it's OK to use it any
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>. As a former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">roommate</ENAMEX> of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">disabled person</ENAMEX>, I became more aware of the
functional aspects of being handicapped. Many of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> do not have
the capacity to "hold it," as you or I do.
            

            

               --A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Concerned Citizen</ENAMEX>
            

            

               
                  Prudie,
               
            

            
               I'm sure you are not
advocating disregarding the rights of the disabled, but I think you may have
misled others to do so. There is a big difference between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">handicapped</ENAMEX> parking
and handicapped <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">restroom stalls</ENAMEX>. Courtesy would dictate yielding designated
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bathroom facilities</ENAMEX> to those who require them, though when available, their use
is not restricted from the general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX>. I would be encouraged to see this
clarification published.

                  Dear
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudence</ENAMEX>,
               
            

            
               Public restrooms are
for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> use. The larger <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stalls</ENAMEX> are meant to accommodate the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">handicapped</ENAMEX>--not
specifically for.
            

            

               --<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phyllis W.</ENAMEX>
            

            Prudie, after much thought, realized several things
about this matter. One is that the disabled have a strong, perhaps
disproportionate, influence when it comes to public policy. Mostly this is to
the good. There are some caveats, however. Prudie remembers the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monthly</TIMEX> story about the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> kiosk <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> that developed wonderful
individual <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bathrooms</ENAMEX> for use on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> tried them but had to give
them up because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lobby</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">disabled persons</ENAMEX> raised such a fuss about
all of them having to be handicapped accessible. This, of course, was an
impossibility, and unreasonable, so none were allowed on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>.

            An illogical example of the power of this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lobby</ENAMEX> can
be found in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>. The number of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bathrooms</ENAMEX> for surgeons and surgical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proximate</ENAMEX> to the operating <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX>, has been reduced so that there can be
wheelchair-accessible <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bathrooms</ENAMEX>. Well, there are no surgeons and allied
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> in wheelchairs, given the nature of the work.

            As some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">correspondents</ENAMEX> did point out, when no stall
is available and there is a line, anyone can use the designated handicapped
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stall</ENAMEX>--if that is the next <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to open up. It is a bit of an ethical conundrum
that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">handicapped</ENAMEX> want fairness, but fairness for them sometimes results in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unfairness</ENAMEX> to others. Perhaps this is an acceptable trade-off, given the
particulars.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudie</ENAMEX>'s reconsidered opinion is that when an
able-bodied <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> enters a public <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">restroom</ENAMEX>, and there is a choice of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stalls</ENAMEX>,
that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> should not go into the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">handicapped</ENAMEX> accessible <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>. Prudie, herself,
after undergoing some rather strong e-mail aversion therapy, plans never to
step foot in the more spacious <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stall</ENAMEX> again.
