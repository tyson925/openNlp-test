               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cross Check</ENAMEX>
            

            I agree with most of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Chapman</ENAMEX>'s conclusions in
"." I will say unashamedly that I am a "born-again" <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christian</ENAMEX>. But I will also
say that you are very correct in pointing out the basic statistical mistake of
implying causation from correlation. I think it is naive to think that simply
posting copies of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ten Commandments</ENAMEX> is going to solve the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s crime
problem.

            I also think it is damaging to the faith to try and
"use" religion to solve social problems. God becomes a means to an end instead
of an end in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Himself</ENAMEX>. He is not a magical potion that you can sprinkle on your
problems to make them go away. I do think that genuine faith and a relationship
with God will cure violence and murder and such; however, imposing religion on
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> is not the answer. I think one of the reasons there is a positive
correlation between religion and crime in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX> is because large portions
of so-called "<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christians</ENAMEX>" in this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> are nominal at best.

            Also, I think that the
number of churchgoers in a given area is relatively inconsequential in this
whole equation. If someone could prove that it was the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christians</ENAMEX> committing
all the crimes, then we would have an interesting situation. But if that is not
the case, then it makes no difference how many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christians</ENAMEX> there are. The real
issue then becomes the motivations for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">criminals</ENAMEX>, which are
things such as the social structure and the justice system.

               In Order To Form an
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Imperfect Union</ENAMEX>
            

            It is wrong, I think, to suggest, as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">William</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saletan</ENAMEX> does in "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Frame Game</ENAMEX>" (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">"</ENAMEX>"), that our current health-care crisis is
caused by the unreasonable expectations of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who seek medical care.
The reason "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> expect better care than they're willing to pay for" is
that they have already paid for it. Medical advances are made through
government subsidy: directly, through tax-supported <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">universities</ENAMEX>, or
indirectly, in the form of tax write-offs for private-sector research and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> that we go to and our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> practice in
essentially all receive some level of governmental funding. Our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX>
attended medical school with the aid of federally guaranteed student loans or
outright grants. We paid for the ability to provide the best care in the world,
and we continue to pay far more, in terms of percentage of gross average annual
individual income, than any other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Western</ENAMEX> society.

            Most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> I know are hard-working,
compassionate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX>. They certainly provide an essential service. They
all make a ton of dough, and I don't know anyone who begrudges them that. The
current medical payment scheme in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> makes the very best medical
care available but is also an active barrier to many who seek basic care and
cannot afford it. Radical reform is clearly called for but will never happen as
long as free-market principles control access to this service. Our current
dilemma has come about because we tried to shift cost control away from the
service <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX>. This has had the effect of driving many capable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX>
out of their own practices and into exactly the kind of alienating, impersonal,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bean-counting HMO</ENAMEX> setting that has caused the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Medical Association</ENAMEX> to
try and become a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">union</ENAMEX>.

            It is sad that the best
technical health-care system in the world is delivered so poorly that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX> charged with caring for us feel compelled to sacrifice their
independence in this way. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unionization</ENAMEX> is a bad idea that will only make things
worse.

Condemnation
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eric Alterman</ENAMEX>'s in your letters column of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 30</TIMEX>
that my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleague</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harvey Klehr</ENAMEX> and I felt the need to "condemn" a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacob</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heilbrunn</ENAMEX> article in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Republic</ENAMEX> is mistaken. We disagreed with a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">judgment Heilbrunn</ENAMEX> advanced in his essay, but disagreement is not condemnation.
Indeed, that one disagreement aside, we have a very high regard for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heilbrunn</ENAMEX>'s
writings. In view of the fact that in the letter to which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alterman</ENAMEX> referred, we
clearly expressed our appreciation of other remarks Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Heilbrunn</ENAMEX> made in his
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">essay</ENAMEX>, no responsible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commentator</ENAMEX> could use the characterization used by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alterman</ENAMEX>.

                  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eric Alterman</ENAMEX>
replies: I dunno. This seems a semantic issue at best. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heilbrunn</ENAMEX>'s article
attacked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yale</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Annals of Communism series</ENAMEX> and the decision by its editorial
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jonathan Brent</ENAMEX>, not to offer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heilbrunn</ENAMEX>'s old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vladimir</ENAMEX>
Brovkin, to edit a series of books about the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Gulag</ENAMEX>. He then accused <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brent</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yale</ENAMEX> of having "caved" in to the ethos of "historical correctness" governed by
"<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">revisionists</ENAMEX> who dismiss as cold war humbug the notion that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Soviet Union</ENAMEX>
was a totalitarian <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>."
            

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Klehr</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Haynes</ENAMEX> wrote a strong letter in
support of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brent</ENAMEX>'s "editorial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX>" and of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brent</ENAMEX> himself. They maintained
that he had "steadfastly insisted on the academic integrity of the series and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">staunchly</ENAMEX> defended [their] work." In other words, virtually everything
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Heilbrunn</ENAMEX> wrote about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brent</ENAMEX> and his alleged cowardice--as well as his many
criticisms of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yale</ENAMEX> series--was wrong. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Haynes</ENAMEX> says this does not constitute
a "condemnation." <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fine</ENAMEX>, I'll grant it if he feels the distinction to be an
important one. I only hope no one ever decides to demonstrate his or her "high
regard" for my writings in this peculiar fashion.
