<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bahor</ENAMEX>--an anaplastologist at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Duke University Medical Center</ENAMEX>--has discovered a new use for the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Barbie</ENAMEX> doll. By placing
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Barbie</ENAMEX>'s legs inside a hollow prosthetic finger, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bahor</ENAMEX> discovered that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Barbie</ENAMEX>'s transplanted knee joint gave <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> greater mechanical flexibility
and control over their artificial digits. "Although you could previously only
move joints that were in the hand [as opposed to the fingers], the plastic in
the legs of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Barbie</ENAMEX> dolls allows <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> to position fingers in different
flexion," she told the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Duke University Chronicle</ENAMEX> . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glenn Hostetter</ENAMEX>, the
medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">center</ENAMEX> prosthetics clinical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supervisor</ENAMEX>, noted that the technique is an
inexpensive way to provide articulation in a finger and that it will help
prosthetic fingers become functional as well as cosmetic appendages.

of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Darwin</ENAMEX> in response to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kansas Board of Education</ENAMEX>'s decision to
eliminate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Darwinism</ENAMEX> from statewide science tests. The exhibit, "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Is</ENAMEX>

staff in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1907</TIMEX>. University <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">librarian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sally Haines</ENAMEX> told the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Associated Press</ENAMEX>,
"<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Librarians</ENAMEX>, we don't censor. ... When there's a controversy, we like to bring
out the books that caused the controversy." While the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> staff isn't
taking an official position on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX>'s decision, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Haines</ENAMEX> did admit, "We have
our personal opinions, and you can probably guess what they are."

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Campbell</ENAMEX> has resigned his post at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Energy</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lawrence Livermore Laboratory</ENAMEX> after
anonymous faxes revealed that he had never earned a doctoral degree. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campbell</ENAMEX>,
formerly associate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> for laser programs at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Livermore</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of a
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1.2 billion</NUMEX> program to conduct weapons research, announced his decision to
leave <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Aug. 27</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campbell</ENAMEX> had allowed the laboratory to believe that he had a
doctorate from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Princeton University</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lab</ENAMEX> said, when in fact he had only
finished his Ph.D. course work. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> also told the New York
Times that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lab</ENAMEX> requires "all senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> to hold a Ph.D. or its
equivalent in experience." <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campbell</ENAMEX> said only that he was leaving for personal
reasons.

            An
unusual fossil skull, which may contain new clues about human evolution, was
discovered in an <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Upper West Side</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">curio</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> reports
that the skull arrived in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop</ENAMEX> as part of a collection of rocks, minerals,
and curios. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop owner</ENAMEX> recognized its significance after he cleaned it and
turned it over to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> at the nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">American Museum of Natural History</ENAMEX>. Paleoanthropologists
examining the skull have traced its origins to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indonesia</ENAMEX> and presume it to be
that of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Homo erectus</ENAMEX>. However, they also note that the skull, which probably
belonged to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">his 20s</TIMEX>, has a high, humanlike forehead, not the sloping
kind typical of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Homo erectus</ENAMEX> and other early hominids. "It's not like any other
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Homo erectus</ENAMEX> we know from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indonesia</ENAMEX> or anywhere else," said Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eric Delson</ENAMEX>,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">City College of New York</ENAMEX> paleoanthropologist directing the investigation.
"Of course, it's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX>, but it could represent a distinctive
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>."

            A team
of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">psychologists</ENAMEX> believes that <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Tourette's syndrome</ENAMEX>--the condition that leads <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> to suffer muscular spasms and to
blurt out obscenities--may be a psychological rather than a physical disorder.
Sufferers may actually be able to control their sputterings, according to
experiments led by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Randy Flanagan</ENAMEX> at Queen's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ontario</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BBC Online</ENAMEX>
reports. In one experiment, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tourette</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> was directed to hold a
weighted box loaded with sensors. Anticipating the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s regular tics, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> monitored how his grip on the sensor box changed as his arm
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">twitched</ENAMEX>. They observed the subject adjusting his grip on the box just before
experiencing a tic, indicating that at some level he was in control of his
actions. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Flanagan</ENAMEX> concluded, "[<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tourette</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sufferers</ENAMEX>] have motor control over
these tics, and these movements look normal and have all the same sort of
response we would expect to see in voluntary movement." He also suggested that
his findings may point the way toward behavioral therapy for the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">syndrome</ENAMEX>.

against the concept in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> op-ed: "The very act of taking notes ...
is a way of engaging the material, wrestling with it, struggling to comprehend

Working from firsthand reports as well as archeological and scientific data,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Krech</ENAMEX> asserts that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Native Americans</ENAMEX> are not the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">proto-environmentalists</ENAMEX> so
fondly imagined by "spiritually undernourished <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>" (in the words of
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Yorker</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nicholas Lemann</ENAMEX>). Rather, they hunted <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> into
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">extinction</ENAMEX>, exhausted large stretches of land, and mismanaged natural

that: "[<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Krech paints</ENAMEX>] us a more complex portrait of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Native American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peoples</ENAMEX>,
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> that rejects mythologies, even those that both <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Native</ENAMEX>

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Education</ENAMEX> . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Frazier</ENAMEX> denied the claims, saying that she missed deadlines
