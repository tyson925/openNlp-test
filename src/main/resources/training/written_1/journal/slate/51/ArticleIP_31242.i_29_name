               <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> lied to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Monetary Fund</ENAMEX>. The country
overestimated its currency reserves by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1 billion</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> while <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">applying for</ENAMEX>
support, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMF</ENAMEX> money may have been used for profiteering. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMF</ENAMEX> is
considering lending <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$4.5 billion</NUMEX> more. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> suggested that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMF</ENAMEX> won't give up
on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> but that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> may give up on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMF</ENAMEX>.

            
               The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX> intercepted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bombers</ENAMEX> over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iceland</ENAMEX>. Western
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> were bewildered by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX>'s first probe of Western air defenses since
the end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Cold War</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moscow</ENAMEX> denied that the flights were unusual.

            

               <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israeli</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prime Minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ehud Barak</ENAMEX> formed a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>. He is partnering
with secular, ethnic, and religious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> that support the peace process. A
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> editorial points out that the coalition <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> share little else.

            
               A
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cable</ENAMEX> car crash killed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alps</ENAMEX>. All were working at a
space <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">observatory</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Authorities</ENAMEX> were unsure of the accident's cause.

            
               The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> raised interest rates. The <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">.25 percent</NUMEX> hike is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</TIMEX>. The ever-hawkish <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> warned of "the emergence, or the potential
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">emergence</ENAMEX>, of inflationary forces that could undermine economic growth."
Inflation <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doves</ENAMEX> argued that the hike will cut jobs. The 
                  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">approves</ENAMEX>, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Greider</ENAMEX>
argues in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> is
needlessly punishing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">masses</ENAMEX>; instead, it should discipline only <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX> that
lend promiscuously.

            

               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> limited Y2K liability. Potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">plaintiffs</ENAMEX> must grant
businesses <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">90 days</TIMEX> for repairs before suing and will be able to collect only
limited punitive damages. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Spins: 1</ENAMEX>) The bill will save computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> from
financial ruin. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) The bill will expose their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> to financial ruin. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>)
It's a slippery slope to leaving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> unprotected in product liability
cases.

            

               <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Kurdish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rebel</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abdullah Ocalan</ENAMEX> was sentenced to death. A <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> court
found him guilty of treason for waging a bloody drive for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Kurdish</ENAMEX> self-rule.
But his execution may not win the requisite parliamentary approval, because
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> fear martyring him and sparking <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Kurdish</ENAMEX> unrest. (Listen to
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chorus</ENAMEX> of pleas for leniency in ".")

            

               <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kosovo</ENAMEX> update: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Serbs</ENAMEX> rallied for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Slobodan Milosevic</ENAMEX>'s
resignation. More <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">protests</ENAMEX> are scheduled in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">coming weeks</TIMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) Ethnic <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Albanians</ENAMEX>
continued to loot and torch <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Serb</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Kosovar Serbs</ENAMEX> continued to flee. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>)
Evidence that directly links <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milosevic</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Serb</ENAMEX> atrocities was found. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> paper the 
                  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Observer</ENAMEX>
                unearthed a trove of documents that
recount how <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milosevic</ENAMEX> planned to systematically eliminate <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Kosovar</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Albanians</ENAMEX>.

            

               <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> proposed using federal budget surpluses to shore up
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare and Social Security</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">larger-than-anticipated</ENAMEX> surplus
would be used to cover prescription drugs for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX> and to
partially fill the projected gap in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> coverage. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX>
countered with a tax-cut plan. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> forecasts that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> will partially yield to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> calls. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> entreats <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> to stand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX>,
warning <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> not to believe in "an accounting mirage to finance a misshapen
tax cut that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> can't afford."

            

               <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> presented his plan for overhauling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX>. His
proposal introduces prescription drug coverage and eliminates payment for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">preventive</ENAMEX> services but aims to cut costs by stoking price competition among
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HMOs</ENAMEX> and requiring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> to chip in for some services. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York</ENAMEX>
Times 
               deems the plan "sensible" and "prudent," and a
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> 
               Post editorial observes that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> deftly "changed the subject from
the solvency of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> to its adequacy." But the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Republic</ENAMEX>

               laments the plan's "gross generational inequity" and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">instructs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> to spend the money on education instead. A
Post 
               news analysis asks "whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> can use his talent
for political positioning to actually implement policy."

            

               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HMOs</ENAMEX> will cut back treatments to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elderly</ENAMEX>. A survey reported that the
industry will force <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX> to chip in for treatment and may ditch
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX> outright. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HMOs</ENAMEX> contend the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> doesn't contribute
enough to allow them to provide adequate care. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patient advocates</ENAMEX> argue that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HMOs</ENAMEX> can't produce the lavish benefits they used to drum up business.

            

               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Physicians</ENAMEX> will unionize against managed care. The American
Medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Association</ENAMEX> voted to form a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">union</ENAMEX> to negotiate for better wages and
working conditions but promised never to strike. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Spins: 1</ENAMEX>) Collective
bargaining will win <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> more control over the type and quantity of
medication they prescribe, resulting in better care for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) Collective
bargaining will win <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> higher pay, resulting in higher costs for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
(Read <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Saletan</ENAMEX>'s "" to see how the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> cultivated their common

               The
independent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counsel</ENAMEX> statute expired. The power to initiate investigations
will once again reside with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney general</ENAMEX>. The 
                  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX>
                warned that the law may be
resurrected "the next time <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> becomes dissatisfied with the way the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX> conducts a politically charged investigation" and urges that
it be replaced with a rule "that would give the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney general</ENAMEX> wide
discretion on when to seek an independent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counsel</ENAMEX> and some say in who that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigator</ENAMEX> is."

            

               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Webster Hubbell</ENAMEX> will plead guilty. In return for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hubbell</ENAMEX>'s
confession that he covered up his and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary Clinton</ENAMEX>'s role in a crooked
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arkansas</ENAMEX> land deal, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth Starr</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> will recommend that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hubbell</ENAMEX> not
return to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prison</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary Clinton</ENAMEX> had been named a potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witness</ENAMEX> in the
trial. Click here for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Novak</ENAMEX>'s explanation in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicago</ENAMEX>

               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George W. Bush</ENAMEX> broke fund-raising records. He has raised <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $36</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">million</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Gore</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">almost $18.5 million</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Bradley</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$11 million</NUMEX>. The

                  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX>
                recounts the unanimous spin from
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Forbes</ENAMEX>, and others who intimate that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> will be beholden to his
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX>.

            

               The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> barred lawsuits against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> for violating federal
laws. Individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">plaintiffs</ENAMEX> will no longer be able to sue states that
violate federal laws; only the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> may do so. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Observers</ENAMEX> called
this a coup for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX>- and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>-appointed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>' rights <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">faction</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Liberals</ENAMEX> protested that the ruling emasculates <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>' power to bind states
to federal law. Law <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Professor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Erwin Chemerinsky</ENAMEX> opines in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los Angeles Times</ENAMEX> that the decision is
"the height of conservative judicial activism" because it "invented new rights
for state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> at the expense of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>." But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">David Ignatius</ENAMEX>
tells 
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> that the court
"is only ratifying a power shift that has already taken place" from the bloated

               The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX> is investigating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>. The company
is accused of failing to disclose all its cash reserves in order to smooth out
fluctuations in its earnings. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> strongly prefers full disclosure of cash
flow. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> 
               dismisses the seriousness of the investigation but
calls it "<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> more headache for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>."

            

               Starbucks profits dipped. The coffee business is fine, but earnings were
sapped by investments in online <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ventures</ENAMEX>, including a retail <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX> and an
magazine. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">CEO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howard Schulz</ENAMEX>'s spin: "We are not just another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> adding a
'dot <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">com</ENAMEX>' to our name." <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> 's retort: "<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX> to

               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Timothy Leary</ENAMEX> was an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> informer. Newly available records show that he
ratted on a radical leftist <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1974</TIMEX> in an attempt to reduce his prison

               A
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">headmaster</ENAMEX> staged a false boycott of the sitcom <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Family Guy</ENAMEX> . The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rev. Richardson Schell</ENAMEX> deluged <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">advertisers</ENAMEX> with letters from a fake <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>,
leading some to cancel potential spots. The show was created by one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schell</ENAMEX>'s
former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pupils</ENAMEX>, who gave some of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> the surname of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schell</ENAMEX>'s former
assistant. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schell</ENAMEX> said he was irked first by the name and then by "obnoxious,
objectionable" content such as presidential, urination, and flatulence jokes.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fox</ENAMEX> rejoined that "an irreverent comedy that can't raise a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clergyman</ENAMEX>'s eyebrows

                crowed that "<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>'s
