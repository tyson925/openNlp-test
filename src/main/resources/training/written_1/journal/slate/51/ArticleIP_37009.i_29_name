<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University</ENAMEX> wants to ditch the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A-plus</ENAMEX>. There are "too many of them to

university <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> told the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> . A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">faculty</ENAMEX> committee
wants to replace the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A-plus</ENAMEX> with an "A with distinction." <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Teachers</ENAMEX> would still

change. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">university</ENAMEX> says the new grade will allow outstanding work to be

            How do
locusts swarm? <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BBC News</ENAMEX> reports that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxford University</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> have
determined that locusts attract other locusts with chemical signals to amass
swarms that can strip a field bare within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX>. Swarming female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locusts</ENAMEX> can
also manipulate the genes in their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX> to ensure that their young will want to
join the swarm immediately. (Locusts reared in seclusion are reluctant to
gather.) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Researchers</ENAMEX> hope to isolate the chemical and use it to design
synthetic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">compounds</ENAMEX> that will block swarming.

<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Poet Laureate Andrew Motion</ENAMEX> has dubbed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Dylan</ENAMEX>'s "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Visions of</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johanna</ENAMEX>" the best song lyrics ever written. Citing "the concentration and

rhapsodized over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">songwriter</ENAMEX>'s use of language. Not all <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> poets share
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Motion</ENAMEX>'s taste. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dannie Abse</ENAMEX> told the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">London Observer</ENAMEX> , "[<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dylan</ENAMEX>'s]
writing is inferior poetry, and inferior poetry is not really poetry at all."
