            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday, Oct. 3, 1999</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holiday Inn</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Charleston</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">W.V.</ENAMEX>

            My name is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Kaufman</ENAMEX>. I normally write about
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">social</ENAMEX> policy for a small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> of opinion, but right now I am driving from
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> in a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Honda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Civic</ENAMEX> with my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elizabeth</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ash</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elizabeth</ENAMEX> is moving to my <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">hometown</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">hamlet</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beverly</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hills</ENAMEX>, to become a sitcom <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX>. E's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pottery Barn</ENAMEX> hope chest is in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">backseat</ENAMEX>, stuffed with books. Her <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">13-inch</NUMEX> television is in the trunk. On the
roof are balanced a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wood</ENAMEX> futon bed frame, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">E</ENAMEX>'s mountain bike, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">E</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">queen</ENAMEX>-size
futon, which I failed to convince her to throw in a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dumpster</ENAMEX>. The whole pile is
tied down with a variety of bungee cords, giving my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Honda</ENAMEX> an appearance not
unlike an updated version of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joad</ENAMEX> family <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicle</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Grapes of</ENAMEX>
Wrath .

            E has recently written several quickie celebrity
bios, and here is an instant celebrity-based guide to our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX>: For me,
think the youthful <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elliott Gould</ENAMEX> of, say, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> Split , slowly
turning into the more eccentric <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elliott Gould</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kicking</ENAMEX> &
Screaming . For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">E</ENAMEX>, think the dewy <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mariel Hemingway</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manhattan</ENAMEX> with
a touch of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Dershowitz</ENAMEX>. In the unreadably bad novel I wrote <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX>, E
was the basis for a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> femme fatale . By Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>, she'd already
run through <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>, including the male <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">protagonist</ENAMEX>, who wrote about social
policy for a small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> of opinion. I trashed the novel when the one person
I showed it to was, how to put it, less than fully supportive. "You have no
idea how to write fiction," she said. "For instance, you have this
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX>--all he cares about is sex and welfare policy! Nobody will believe
that! You have to flesh him out a bit! Give him some real human qualities."

            Why would I take a week off from work to drive E
and her stuff <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2,800 miles</NUMEX> across the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>? Because driving across the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> is my idea of a vacation. I've done it <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 14</NUMEX> previous times. I enjoy
doing it alone. Doing it with another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> is that much better. True, I used
to be interested in E, but that was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX>, and we're now just good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>.
I have no desire or expectation that anything romantic will happen on this
journey. Please remember this, as it is an important point. No expectations.
None at all. Zero. Right.

            I would say the trip began with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> trouble
signs. In order of increasing troublesomeness, they are:

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) E is on a health kick and declared, "I only want
to eat tofu on this trip." I try to let her down gently, suggesting that while
of course they surely stock the basic tofu products in, say, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Silt</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colo.</ENAMEX>, they
might not have the selection she has come to expect.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) She mentioned that there is some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> who wants
to meet her in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Vegas</ENAMEX> and take her to a show.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) She has brought a tape of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Crosby</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stills</ENAMEX> &
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nash</ENAMEX>.

            We've already discovered that it is hard to follow
the news on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">This morning</TIMEX>, at our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>, we briefly saw
the new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">outsider</ENAMEX>/insurgent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Gore</ENAMEX>, giving an
interview to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Schieffer</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX>. It seemed as if <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX>'s thin hard carapace of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">impenetrability</ENAMEX> has been replaced by a thick, smooth gelatinous coating that is
equally impenetrable. But I don't know for sure. I also know there are some
expense-account accusations against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX>'s campaign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tony Coelho</ENAMEX>, but
don't know who the anti-Coelho factions are that are spreading them (or why
they couldn't dig up something bigger).

            And has the following point been made on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Op-Ed</ENAMEX>
pages: that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arianna Huffington</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Warren Beatty</ENAMEX> have chosen to attack centrist
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX> as cynical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sellouts</ENAMEX> who ignore <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX> poverty just when, according
to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Census Bureau</ENAMEX>, those cynical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">centrists</ENAMEX> are making the greatest strides
against poverty that have been made in my adult lifetime? ("<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Poverty Drops</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Year</TIMEX> Low"--that was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA Today</ENAMEX> headline we saw at a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wal-Mart</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morgantown</ENAMEX>.) Poor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beatty</ENAMEX> has a need to think Clintonite <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX> aren't
tackling race and poverty, much like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marx</ENAMEX> had a need for a proletariat, except
that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marx</ENAMEX>'s need was theoretical, while <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beatty</ENAMEX>'s is only theatrical. And <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marx</ENAMEX>'s
was closer to reality.

            The best sign so far? Somewhere in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maryland</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">panhandle, E</ENAMEX> and I were for some reason discussing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wendy Shalit</ENAMEX>'s book, The
Return of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Modesty</ENAMEX> , which makes the case for chastity, patience, courtship,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">etc. Shalit</ENAMEX> argues that when you walk down the street you can tell the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">virgins</ENAMEX>
by their fresh, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">healthful</ENAMEX> glow. E's critique, in full: "I don't know. I always
thought it was the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> who got fucked that had the healthy glow." She also
said she hasn't had sex in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</TIMEX>, which I didn't believe. But, come to
think of it, she does look a bit pale.
