            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> very important factor that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Emily Yoffe</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">"</ENAMEX>")
leaves out in all the comparisons among diets in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> is
genetic/ethnic background.

            Did these studies compare <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> to
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African-Americans</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">native Africans</ENAMEX>?

            The genetics of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> descent can be
vastly different from a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> descent. Osteoporosis,
<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX>, and sexual maturation are all highly influenced by genetics.
Unless you are comparing rural <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diets</ENAMEX> with the diets of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> with
the same ethnic background, these comparisons are largely invalid.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Northern Europe</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North America</ENAMEX> have
consumed dairy products as a large part of their diets for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX>. They also
tend to have very different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body types</ENAMEX> than <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asians or Africans</ENAMEX>. It is known
that many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> ethnic origin and other ethnic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> (including
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asian</ENAMEX>) have problems digesting milk products past puberty. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> descent often do not have this problem. Could it also be that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ethnicities</ENAMEX> have more problems with hip fractures or higher estrogen
levels for reasons other than diet?

            Just because rural
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> may not need high dairy consumption to be healthy
does not mean that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> should be discouraged from drinking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk</ENAMEX>.

               The Values
Thing
            

            With respect to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacob Weisberg</ENAMEX>'s "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Ballot Box"</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">"</ENAMEX>"),
he makes one decent point, and then blows it.

            It's true that, as he says, "We're electing someone
to run the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>, not <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minister</ENAMEX> to the condition of our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">souls</ENAMEX>." And though
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Clinton</ENAMEX> proves that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> will elect <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">presidents</ENAMEX> who feel their pain,
still I think <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weisberg</ENAMEX> is close to the mark on this point. But from there, he
goes wrong.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George W. Bush</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Bradley</ENAMEX> are not talking
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about</NUMEX> individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holders</ENAMEX> of wealth. Nor are they engaging in subtle class
warfare. They are responding to those who would assert that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> society as
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a whole</TIMEX> is just fine because it is collectively wealthy. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> society is
manifestly not "just fine."

            I believe the majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>, if they think
about it at all--and keep in mind that the ones who think about it are also the
ones who take the time to vote--think that our cultural life has coarsened, or
even debased, and that the sense of "values" that just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> or even fewer years
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ago</TIMEX> meant that the majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> felt no need to lock their doors has
been, perhaps irretrievably, lost. How else can <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> understand tragedies
such as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Littleton</ENAMEX>, in which "normal" middle-class <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> are not playing <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">baseball</ENAMEX>
or flirting with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> or even duking out their differences after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> on the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">playground</ENAMEX>; they are nursing monstrous visions of murder and mayhem, while
building bombs in their clueless <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garage</ENAMEX>. Anyone who pays the least
attention could make a long list of their preferred examples.

            This is the spiritual
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">emptiness Bush</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX> are talking about. Not whether a 27-year-old
"Dellionaire" is bored with his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lamborghini</ENAMEX>. Or whether those less fortunate
are envious of his horsepower.

               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Revenge Killings</ENAMEX>,
Served Up <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Cold</ENAMEX>
            

            I must thank <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Greenberg</ENAMEX> for the fascinating
"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">History Lesson"</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">"</ENAMEX>") on the postwar <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Revenge Group</ENAMEX>," but I disagree
that such an organized and, frankly, insane plan has much in common with the
revenge killings by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Albanians</ENAMEX> (we assume) of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Serbs</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">present-day</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kosovo</ENAMEX>.

            I think the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Serbian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> were the
evil monsters in the recent conflict--the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Yugoslav</ENAMEX> army maybe less so--and that
the outcome of our bombing campaign was generally a good thing. However, I've
never had any illusions about the unsavory nature of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kosovo Liberation</ENAMEX>
Army, as the more simple-minded media <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outlets</ENAMEX> seem to still hold.

            The killings of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Serbian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX> look to be a
case of classic terrorism with a clear political aim--scaring the remaining
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Serbs</ENAMEX> out of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kosovo</ENAMEX>. Killing even the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> and old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> doesn't sound much like
the vengeance of honorable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>.

            The "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Revenge Group</ENAMEX>," on the other hand, was bent on
carrying out revenge killing without any political aim. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Nazis</ENAMEX> were well out
of power; nothing would have come of the killings except a vague sense of
self-satisfaction on the part of those involved.

            In any case, I can't
condone what either <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">killers</ENAMEX> did or planned to do. To even for an
instant try to intellectually justify killing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> simply
because other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> did unspeakable things--whether that group
consists of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Serbian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> or imprisoned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guards</ENAMEX>--is lazy thinking. It's
plainly wrong, and there's no amount of philosophizing that could convince me
it's not.

               How To Keep Your
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Kids From Turning Into Tele</ENAMEX> Tubbies
            

            The recent installment
of "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Culturebox</ENAMEX>" (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">"</ENAMEX>") by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judith Shulevitz</ENAMEX> deserves comment. She's wrong: The
issue isn't that working <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> must choose between anesthetizing their
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> with television or catering to all their whims while also trying to
pay the bills and nuke the frozen dinner. Given a little guidance and some
suitable <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">playthings</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> who don't get hooked on television at an early
age are actually perfectly capable of amusing themselves for long stretches of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>. Obviously there's a lot more to say on the subject, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shulevitz</ENAMEX> doesn't
seem to be aware of much that has already been said.
