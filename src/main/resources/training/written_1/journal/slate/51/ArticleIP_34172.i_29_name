            "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">And Jacob</ENAMEX> said to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rebekah</ENAMEX>, his mother, 'Behold,
Esau my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> is a hairy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>, and I am a smooth <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>, so maybe I should take
him to a good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stylist</ENAMEX> who would no doubt be, as so many of them are, gay. And
attending a state fair.'" (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Genesis 27:11</TIMEX>)

            All well and good, but what really intrigued <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News</ENAMEX>
Quiz <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> was the coincidence of names between a certain hair stylist
(no doubt gay; they all are) and a giant amusement <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> attraction. And
because, refreshed by my vacation, I want only to please you, here is the
uncharacteristically melancholy entry from the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1960</TIMEX> edition of the World
Book <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Encyclopedia</ENAMEX> describing the invention of the popular ride:

            "The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Ferris</ENAMEX> wheel was the largest of all. It
was much larger than wheels seen <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>. It was built by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">G. W. Gale Ferris</ENAMEX>, a
mechanical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineer</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Galesburg</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ill.</ENAMEX>, for the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World's Columbian Exposition</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1893</TIMEX>. The wheel was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">250 feet</NUMEX> in diameter and had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX>. Each of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> could carry <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX>. After it was used at the exhibition in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1904</TIMEX>, the wheel was sold for scrap metal. By heartless bastards
without an ounce of poetry in their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">souls</ENAMEX>. You pour your guts into something,
trying to create a little beauty and wonder<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">--250 feet</NUMEX> tall!--and they just use
you up and throw you away. Why try? Why live?" <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last few</TIMEX> sentences added by an
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">autumnal News Quiz</ENAMEX>, if it matters, which hardly seems likely, so ephemeral are
the works of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>, as transient as the mood-lifting effects of a vacation.

visiting. "And I want to do her hair!" exclaimed the giddy <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferris</ENAMEX>, "I've always
