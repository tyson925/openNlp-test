               The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> passed compromise gun control legislation. The
measure requires background checks on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">gun</ENAMEX>-show sales but reduces the time
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> have to perform them from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three days</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>. A tougher measure
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resembling</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last month</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> legislation was defeated, despite ardent
lobbying by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Janet Reno</ENAMEX> . Everyone agrees it's a coup for the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Rifle Association</ENAMEX>, which had been taken for dead after <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Littleton</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX> explained the loss by asserting that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NRA</ENAMEX> distorted the stricter
measure, claiming it would lead to confiscation and a national gun registry;

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> but are unwilling to defy the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NRA</ENAMEX> on the cusp of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">an election year</TIMEX>.

            

               The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> authorized <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> to decide whether to let the Ten
Commandments be displayed in public <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Proponents</ENAMEX> offered the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bill</ENAMEX> as a response to "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> killing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>." <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Detractors</ENAMEX> called it an

pressure to pass gun control legislation.

            

               <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kosovo</ENAMEX> update: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) Western <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diplomats</ENAMEX> urged <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> to end its
occupation of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kosovo</ENAMEX>'s main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> agreed to share control of the
airport but still demands its own peacekeeping zone. Western <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> say that
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> is too <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Serb</ENAMEX>-friendly to be entrusted with such authority and that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kosovars</ENAMEX> won't resettle in a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX>-controlled zone. The likely compromise: a
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> "zone of responsibility" inside a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX>-controlled area. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Read</ENAMEX>

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">church</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> urged them to trust the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peacekeepers</ENAMEX> and stay. Meanwhile,

bring down <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milosevic</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>. They claim the plan isn't directed at
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milosevic</ENAMEX> personally.

            

               A former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Symbionese Liberation Army</ENAMEX> was

<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>, through tips from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>'s Most
Wanted . She was indicted in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1976</TIMEX> for allegedly placing pipe bombs under
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police cruisers</ENAMEX> (the bombs didn't explode). Her <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minnesota</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> expressed
shock, citing her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> involvement and her terrific casserole.

            

               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coke</ENAMEX> is making Europeans ill. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coca-Cola</ENAMEX> products were removed

<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozens</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drinkers</ENAMEX> complained of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">nausea</ENAMEX> and intestinal trouble. (See "" for a
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> reaction.) The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> traced the problem to a preservative used on
shipping pallets and a bad batch of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon dioxide</ENAMEX>, neither of which presents a
serious health threat. Financial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> say the serious threat is to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coke</ENAMEX>'s
overseas sales, which make up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">73 percent</NUMEX> of its profits.

            

               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Gore</ENAMEX> declared his candidacy for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>. His speech and
accompanying interviews stressed his independence from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Clinton</ENAMEX>. But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">George</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">W. Bush</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> "the status quo," and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> agreed that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s
agenda will be "a very successful platform for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> to run from."
Despite <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX>'s announcement, the

elected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mandela</ENAMEX> received a unanimously fond farewell . Former
apartheid <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supporters</ENAMEX> called him "a saintly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>," and a conservative white paper
declared that he will be "sorely missed."
