            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX>
on <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Meet the Press</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chief of Staff</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Podesta</ENAMEX> demonstrated
how <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX> plan to win the budget debate. Answer to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Question 1</ENAMEX>: The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GOP</ENAMEX>'s
new legislation "uses up the entire surplus for this risky tax scheme." Answer
to Question <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>: "It would clearly be better to ... pay down <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$100 billion</NUMEX> worth
of debt than pass this risky tax scheme." Answer to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Question 3</ENAMEX>: Failure to cut
taxes would be "better than seeing this risky tax scheme signed into law." The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way Podesta</ENAMEX> puts it, it's not clear whether the "scheme" would cut your taxes
or raise them. That's the whole idea.

            "Risky
tax scheme" was coined in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> to refer to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Dole</ENAMEX>'s proposed <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 percent</NUMEX> tax
cut. According to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democratic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Committee</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> campaign ads,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dole</ENAMEX>'s plan was "risky" because it would "balloon the deficit" and force
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> "to cut <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX>, education, [and the] environment." The rationale for
calling it a tax "scheme"--in contrast to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s tax "cuts"--was
that it would "actually raise taxes on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9 million</NUMEX> working <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>" by narrowing
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Earned Income Tax Credit</ENAMEX>.

            
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> blasted <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dole</ENAMEX>'s "risky tax scheme" in every speech, but that wasn't
enough for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Gore</ENAMEX>. In the vice presidential debate, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> used the phrase eight
times. Pundits marveled at his robotic repetition. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dole</ENAMEX>'s campaign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX>
protested that "leaving money in someone's pocket is not a scheme" but later
conceded that this "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">focus-group</ENAMEX> tested" phrase had killed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Republican</ENAMEX>
ticket.

            Now
the deficit has turned into a surplus, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dole</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 percent</NUMEX> plan has given way
to other tax-cut proposals. But that hasn't stopped <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> from renewing his
favorite chant. At a senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX>' rally <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last fall</TIMEX>, he used the magic phrase
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> "are trying to come up with this huge, risky tax
scheme and finance it by taking money out of the surplus that has been built up
entirely because of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> trust fund," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> warned. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Two months</TIMEX>
later, he assailed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George W. Bush</ENAMEX>'s "compassionate conservatism," declaring,
"Compassion means reserving the surplus until we save <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> first ...
not going back to the risky tax schemes and economic upheaval of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the '80s</TIMEX>."

            Today,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX> use "risky tax scheme" with abandon, ignoring the
disappearance of the circumstances that originally justified the phrase. In
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>, a tax cut was "risky" if it would "balloon the deficit." In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>, it's
"risky" if it would "blow the surplus." In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>, a "tax scheme" was a plan that
ostensibly would raise taxes on some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> while cutting taxes for others. In
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>, "tax scheme" is just a euphemism--actually, a malphemism--to conceal that
your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponent</ENAMEX> is proposing a tax cut and to trick uninformed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">listeners</ENAMEX> into
thinking that he might raise their taxes instead.

            You
can argue, as even some <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> do, that the current tax-cut bill is a
scheme because it favors the wealthy and various special interests. But it's
still a tax cut. The only reason to delete the word "cut" when referring to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bill</ENAMEX> is to withhold this information because you know it would incline your
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> to support the bill. For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> have called budget outlays
"spending," "welfare," and "waste" to conceal that half the money goes back to
the middle class through entitlements. "Risky tax scheme" is the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX>'
most concerted attempt to turn this tactic against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GOP</ENAMEX>. The message is:
When <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> mess with the tax code, somebody else is getting the money,
and you're getting screwed.

            The
price of this spin is that it insults <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>'s intelligence, in part through
deceptive censorship and in part through mindless repetition. Podesta denounces
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GOP</ENAMEX>'s "risky tax scheme" at least twice per interview. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Two weeks ago</TIMEX>, a DNC
press release used the phrase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> times in a span of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> words. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> seems
incapable of appearing in public without reciting "risky tax scheme" three
times. Rather than simply acknowledge the tax cut and argue its merits, he's
betting that we're stupid. In the long run, that's not a smart bet.
