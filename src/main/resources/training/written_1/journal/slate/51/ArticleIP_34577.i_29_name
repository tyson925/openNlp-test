            Banana <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX>. If
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time magazine</ENAMEX> were half the trend-spotter it thinks it is, that's the
banner it would run to mark the triumph of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reaganism</ENAMEX>, transforming the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX> into the kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">South American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> we used to deride. We now have
the essentials--a huge <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX> dominated by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> far to the right of the rest
of society, a vast chasm between a tiny rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minority</ENAMEX> and everyone else, and
the proliferation of soap operas in prime time, despite the
counterrevolutionary snubbing of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Sopranos</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Emmy</ENAMEX>

               The wealthiest <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1 percent</NUMEX> earned <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as much</NUMEX> after taxes as the poorest <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>.

               That ratio has more than doubled since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1977</TIMEX>.

               The poorest <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80 percent</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> now earns a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">smaller percentage</NUMEX> of the

            It's scary to have "an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer corps</ENAMEX> so
overwhelmingly <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> ."

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Professor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stevenson</ENAMEX> was
commenting on a study conducted by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Triangle Institute for Security Studies</ENAMEX>,
comparing the social and political views of the military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elite</ENAMEX> with those of
prominent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX>. The study concluded that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX> are far to the right
of the general society.

            
               Scary 
               Facts:
            

            

               <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Sixty-four</NUMEX> percent of the military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> but <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 30 percent</NUMEX> of the

               <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Sixty-seven</NUMEX> percent of the military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> but <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 32 percent</NUMEX> of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> call themselves "conservative."

               <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Forty-five percent</NUMEX> of the military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> but <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 17 percent</NUMEX> of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> would bar <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homosexuals</ENAMEX> from military <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">service</ENAMEX>.

               <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Seventy</TIMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">four percent</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> but <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 46 percent</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX>
favor school prayer.

               <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Only 10 percent</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> but <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">37 percent</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> think
capital punishment should be banned.

            

            "In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19 th century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> frequently
had political alignments," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stevens</ENAMEX> said, "but they did not favor a single party
consistently."

            Defense Secretary
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Cohen</ENAMEX> said it would be a major challenge for him "to somehow prevent a
chasm from developing between the military and civilian worlds." News Quiz host
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Randy Cohen</ENAMEX>, his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35 years</TIMEX>, said, "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Too late</ENAMEX>. And, actually, no
