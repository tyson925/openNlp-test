<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundred eighty-two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have died in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX> heat wave. Health
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> worried about more deaths, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX> worried about their <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crops</ENAMEX>. An
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agriculture Department</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">meteorologist</ENAMEX> said that in some regions "there is a
drought that is comparable to the drought of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the '30s</TIMEX>." (Chatterbox wonders it
can get.)

            

               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rudolph Giuliani</ENAMEX> raised money for his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Senate</ENAMEX> campaign in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arkansas</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giuliani</ENAMEX> insisted that he went "to learn more about the things
that unite <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX>," but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> called it a "brazen
publicity stunt." <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gov.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike Huckabee</ENAMEX> jested, "He's never been here
before, he's never worked here, he's never lived here. ... <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> he will be
announcing his candidacy for some significant major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arkansas</ENAMEX>."
Meanwhile, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times Magazine</ENAMEX> prepares <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rudy</ENAMEX>.

            
               The

industries. It will monitor nonmilitary government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> and track
banking, telecommunications, and transportation <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX>. Civil <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">libertarians</ENAMEX>
warned the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> that the monitoring could be misused for
spying on or hacking into private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX>.

            

               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eileen Collins</ENAMEX> became the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">command</ENAMEX> and land a space
shuttle. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Observers</ENAMEX> called her landing "beautiful" and "textbook." <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX>
later acknowledged that the shuttle suffered a hydrogen leak and a
short-circuit as it took off.

            

               <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> gathered support for a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$792 billion</NUMEX> tax-cut plan.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GOP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> appeased <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">moderates</ENAMEX> by agreeing to condition the cuts on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yearly</TIMEX>
reductions in the federal debt. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Ways and</ENAMEX>

                  autopilot
               " and
argues that the cuts epitomize compassionate conservatism. But in the same
pages, deficit-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hawk ex-Sens.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam Nunn</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Warren Rudman</ENAMEX> assert that the surplus
should be used to pay down the deficit , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Novak</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocates</ENAMEX> a
"modest, effective" plan quietly being brokered by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lindsey Graham</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">S.C.</ENAMEX>
The paper condemns the bill as "misshapen," "unaffordable," and
"a further mortgage on an already overburdened future." <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>
warned, "I will not allow a risky plan to become law."

               A

He killed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> sightseers in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February</TIMEX> and decapitated a park-employed
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">naturalist</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX>. After the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> killings, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> had questioned the

his deft leadership, opposition to militant <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Islam</ENAMEX>, and brokerage of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Middle East</ENAMEX>

for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">funeral</ENAMEX> (see "" for more). The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> 
               Post lauds
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hassan</ENAMEX>'s "moderation and reason" but wishes he had done more to speed his own

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China Daily</ENAMEX> accused the sect of spreading superstition, hoodwinking
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, provoking unrest, and jeopardizing stability. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX>
calls the sect harmless and warns <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> against "returning to the ideological

                why <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israelis</ENAMEX>

<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee Teng</ENAMEX>-hui for venturing down "a dead <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">alley</ENAMEX>" and swimming
against the "historical tide" of unification. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Weekly Standard</ENAMEX>
argues that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> should back <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> with words now and, if necessary, military
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">force</ENAMEX> later, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> reports that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">envoys</ENAMEX> will
pressure him to back down. The Wall Street

               The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> spent <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">hundreds of millions of dollars</NUMEX> on projects
unapproved by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>. According to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> , a
congressional report accuses the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> of funding a top-secret <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX>
program, an <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$800 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">satellite</ENAMEX>, a high-tech missile defense system
previously rejected by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>, and other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">unapproved</ENAMEX> purchases. The report
expresses shock at the flagrant illegality of the expenditures. "Do we get it
right <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100 percent</NUMEX> of the time? Of course not," the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> responded.

            

               The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> agreed that a new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> should supervise nuclear weapons
research. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> would report directly to the secretary of energy.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Sponsors</ENAMEX> of the plan say it would institute accountability for security
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">breaches</ENAMEX>, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> reportedly prefers an even stronger independent
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agency</ENAMEX>.

            
               The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASDAQ</ENAMEX> market are going public. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Supporters</ENAMEX>

the glass ceiling "is at least cracking."

            

               <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Woodstock '99</TIMEX> ended in vandalism, looting, and arson. Concert-goers

absence of labels implies "that cigars are a safe alternative to
