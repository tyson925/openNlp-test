               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Randy</ENAMEX>'s Wrap-Up
            

            While the headline seems to describe something
pretty scary, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> qualities--huge, powerful, fast--actually sound
pretty appealing until the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> comes along. We'd welcome a huge, powerful,
fast <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> or coal mining apparatus, or mythical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">railroad</ENAMEX>-constructing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hero</ENAMEX> like
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Henry</ENAMEX>. But meanness trumps the other qualities. Once it arrives in the
sentence, even reversing the previous <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> gets you nowhere. There's nothing
attractive about something small, weak, slow, and mean. Horrible. Like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">George</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wallace</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">his twilight years</TIMEX>.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> tiny typo, one
dropped letter would transform the headline into a dark and pompous assertion
about the human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">race</ENAMEX>: "HE'S HUGE, HE'S POWERFUL, HE'S <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">FAST</ENAMEX> AND HE'S <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">MAN</ENAMEX>." Two
dropped letters, and we've reached the ludicrously boastful, like the lyrics to
some dreary rap: "HE'S HUGE, HE'S POWERFUL, HE'S <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">FAST</ENAMEX> AND HE'S ME." <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Three</TIMEX>
dropped letters, and it's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Bond</ENAMEX> making a catty remark about a co-worker.
That <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">007</NUMEX>, he is just so mean!

            
               Anglocentric
Answer:
            

            "<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Thousands</NUMEX> of terrified <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holidaymakers</ENAMEX> fled
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Florida</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">last night</TIMEX> as monster <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Hurricane Floyd</ENAMEX> headed towards them."

            That storm has
apparently targeted <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vacationers</ENAMEX> with its stormlike fury. Some other
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>-relevant details from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mirror</ENAMEX> 's coverage:

            

               "The storm, twice the size of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> ..."

               " 'It's terrifying,' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Debby Campbell</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>, of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bath</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Somerset</ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Miami</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beach</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lisa Shepherd</ENAMEX>."

               "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kevin Gater</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>, planned to marry <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samantha Robinson</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>, there on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX>
but they are sheltering on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX>-floor <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ballroom</ENAMEX> of their hotel near the
capital <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Nassau</ENAMEX>. 'The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">wedding</ENAMEX> was to be in a gazebo on the beach but I don't
suppose that will still be standing,' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kevin</ENAMEX>, of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stoke</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Staffs</ENAMEX>."

               "Were she still alive, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diana</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">People's Princess</ENAMEX>, would also fear the
colossal storm, but would admirably conceal her terror with a plucky smile and
fistful of mood-altering <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> obtained from the rich lay-abouts she thinks of
as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>," the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mirror</ENAMEX> did not add.

            

            Incidentally, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mirror 's</ENAMEX> headline is not just arbitrary sensationalism; it is
sensationalism with a source, a description of the storm offered by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moore</ENAMEX>, a "public safety <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boss</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Carolina</ENAMEX>."
