                     Among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> pages of rules are these: <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> must

Wrap-Up
            

            Comical misogyny, like that underpinning <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s
question, comes in a variety of forms, none more impressive than <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Man</ENAMEX>
Show , a beer-fueled, bikini-clad exercise in frat-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> reassurance that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">debuts</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</TIMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Comedy Central</ENAMEX>.

            With a self-congratulatory smirk, the show presents
the most bullying reactionary ideas as if they were progressive . It's
the naughtiness of the privileged that runs something like this: Everyone says
it's wrong to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">club</ENAMEX> kittens with cinder blocks. Well, I'm no <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">slave</ENAMEX> to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">convention</ENAMEX>, I just beat the hell out of them. I'm a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rebel</ENAMEX>, and only a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prude</ENAMEX>
would complain. This bit of logical high jinks can justify anything from racism
to the flat tax.

            Offering up loutish claptrap used to require a
different sort of justification. The old method was to insist that it was
"satire." <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Applied</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, the line would run that <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Man Show</ENAMEX> is not the
thing but is a parody of the thing. (The thing being the social ideas of Frank
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sinatra</ENAMEX> around the time he was eating <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX> off the belly of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hooker</ENAMEX> and
slapping around his girlfriends. Still a lively topic in philosophical circles,
apparently.) But satire requires a critical stance, while <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Man Show</ENAMEX>
requires jokes about <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women drivers</ENAMEX> and farting <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkeys</ENAMEX>.

            This justification devolved into the light irony
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">defense</ENAMEX>: Our show may be rubbish, but we know it's rubbish. Through a process
of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alchemy</ENAMEX>, self-awareness transforms rubbish into lucrative
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nonrubbish</ENAMEX>.

            The most modern and
least demanding defense relies on the personal virtue of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">producer</ENAMEX>. I'm a
good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>, therefore anything that I do is, by definition, good. Thus, The
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Man Show</ENAMEX> , produced by a good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> (and I know him, he's a nice <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fellow</ENAMEX>) is
OK, but if, say, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Trump</ENAMEX> had produced it, it would be vile. It's Borges
logic. It's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calvinism</ENAMEX>, with enormous breasts, bouncing on a trampoline.

Answer
            

            These are the rules for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prostitutes</ENAMEX> working for one
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar owner</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kabukicho</ENAMEX>, or "entertainment zone." Rule <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX>,
incidentally, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, "When a customer sings karaoke, please, everyone
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clap</ENAMEX>."

            Lately, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japanese</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gangsters</ENAMEX> are finding it hard to compete with vibrant immigrant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">entrepreneurs</ENAMEX>.
"The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gangs</ENAMEX> are taking business from us in every area--in prostitution,
in gambling, in fencing, in stolen goods," said one yakuza to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">York Times</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nicholas Kristof</ENAMEX>. "The difference between us is that
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">yakuza</ENAMEX> think of long-term business relationships, but the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mafia</ENAMEX> thinks just of the short term. Their only goal is money, money,
money."

            In yet another spasm of millennial list making, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Film Institute</ENAMEX> ranks <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the century</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stars</ENAMEX> as "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">50 Legends</ENAMEX>." If only the

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Humphrey Bogart</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Katharine Hepburn</ENAMEX> did co-star in The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">African Queen</ENAMEX> ,
but few other equally ranked pairs ever worked together. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Participants</ENAMEX> are
invited to rectify that.

            From the list, available on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AFI</ENAMEX>'s Web
