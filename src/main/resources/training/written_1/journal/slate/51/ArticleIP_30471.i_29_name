Wrap-Up
            

            The worst part about the sea, as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ramanathan</ENAMEX> and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scripps Institution</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oceanography</ENAMEX> must both lament when it comes time for
their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> talent show, is that nothing amusing ever takes place beneath it.
Which you certainly couldn't say about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Errol Flynn</ENAMEX>. Which is why <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NoÃ«l Coward</ENAMEX>
set so few of his plays underwater. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Bond</ENAMEX>, on the other hand, is always
poking about in some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">villain</ENAMEX>'s undersea lair, and his attempts at repartee are
just parody bait. When the diving suits go on, the witty banter stops.
Something to do with all those air hoses, like trying to be witty at the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dentist</ENAMEX>. It is impossible to name a single amusing movie that takes place
beneath the waves. Just look at <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dolphins</ENAMEX>, the very model of marine
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sophistication</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">creature</ENAMEX> whose intelligence we're always called upon to
admire like some horrible precocious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>. They're frequently found at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sea</ENAMEX>
World, performing in shows whose dialogue will not be quoted later at dinner.
In some <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>, they'd be the dinner. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">dolphin</ENAMEX>, not the precocious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>.
Although it's a thought.

            There are, of course,
many elegant and flirtatious scenes set on yachts. Clearly, wit operates best
on the surface.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vast Polluted</ENAMEX>
Answer
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ramanathan</ENAMEX> announced the discovery of a vast haze,
<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3.8 million square miles</NUMEX>, about the size of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, hanging over the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indian Ocean</ENAMEX>. "It appeared as if the whole <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subcontinent</ENAMEX> was surrounded
by a mountain of pollution," he said.

            The problem with this haze, blown over the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> by
winter winds from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Himalayas</ENAMEX>, is that it blocks out sunlight, lowering the
temperature.

            The prevailing winds
reverse in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late spring</TIMEX>, blowing the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">haze</ENAMEX> north over the land, where its
particles combine with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">monsoon rains</ENAMEX> and fall to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">earth</ENAMEX>, dissipating the
cloud. But that's bad too, because the haze-sodden precipitation is just the
sort of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid rain</ENAMEX> that plays havoc with both terrestrial and marine life.
