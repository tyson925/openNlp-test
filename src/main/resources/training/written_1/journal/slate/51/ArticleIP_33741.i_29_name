               Rush to
Judgment
            

            All this sorority
bashing is getting so old (see the "," by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alison Spurgeon</ENAMEX>, sorority
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX>). Ironically, those who spout off the most about <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> life and
conformity are just as guilty of it. Do <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who are covered with piercings
and tattoos really believe they are expressing their individuality? They are
just as conformist; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> naturally gravitate toward <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> and chances to
belong to a larger whole.

            Having been in a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sorority</ENAMEX> and then working in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>, nonprofits, and the corporate world, I
find that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> life was very representative of the "real world." Every house
has <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">idiots</ENAMEX>, sluts, social climbers, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alcoholics</ENAMEX>. Every <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> also has
geniuses, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">philanthropists</ENAMEX>, and varying kinds of campus <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX>. There are
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">brown</ENAMEX>-nosing and backstabbing and viciousness. There are also kindness and
loyalty and real bonds that are developed between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. For someone like me,
who hadn't had very many close friendships with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, it was a truly
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">beneficial</ENAMEX> experience, even if I hated a lot of what went on.

<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Levitt</ENAMEX>
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven Levitt</ENAMEX> is being extremely disingenuous when
he claims that he takes no position on the public policy implications of his
research (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">"</ENAMEX>"). Obviously crime is a bad thing, so if your research indicates a
correlation between a social <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">practice</ENAMEX>--abortion--and a reduction in crime, you
are at a minimum implicitly advocating that practice with the minimum of legal
restrictions.

            Your analogy to global warming research points up
the deceit. The impetus for research on global warming has come from those who
believe that fossil <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fuel</ENAMEX> consumption is out of control and who reinforce their
beliefs with global warming research, given everyone's understanding that major
man-made climatic change is a bad thing. No one is out there advocating global
warming. Maybe your research is right, maybe it is wrong, but you undermine
your credibility when you claim to be oblivious to its implications. You had to
have a thesis going in when you started your research, and given that we
already knew crime rates were falling, it is hard to believe you weren't
looking for a correlation between abortion and falling crime rates. Life is too
short to use one's career wandering in the dark, and no one is going to believe
that's what you did.

            By all means, fight back
on the eugenics attacks. That's below the belt. I think it is perfectly
respectable for you to use your results to say that all those who have been
pointing to overall demographic shifts, or changing police tactics, or
increasing incarceration rates are missing a key factor. But you are just
waving a red flag to a bull when you cast attacks on others for supposedly
misreading you altogether.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lamar Alexander</ENAMEX>'s campaign never got off the ground
because the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> can recognize a phony (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">"</ENAMEX>"). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander</ENAMEX> can and will
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mold</ENAMEX> himself into anything. As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX> of education he was for
"Break-the-<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Mold</ENAMEX>" <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>. Earlier he had favored comprehensive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>. Now
that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have turned against large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> interventions, he wants to
make every school a "charter <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>" with power vested in the parents and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX>. He says this will make our system the best. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Linda Wertheimer</ENAMEX>
asked him, "How would we know?" there was a moment of glorious dead air.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Lewis</ENAMEX>,
interviewed about his book <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Trail Fever</ENAMEX> , observed that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander</ENAMEX> "did
something I didn't think possible in this campaign. He proved you could be too
phony. This is why <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> feared him most of all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX>. He was so
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">malleable</ENAMEX>. He even looks a little like <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">putty</ENAMEX>."
