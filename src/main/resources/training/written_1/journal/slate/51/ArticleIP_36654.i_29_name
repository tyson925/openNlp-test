               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Randy</ENAMEX>'s Wrap-Up
            

            I hate the space
program. It's <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bread</ENAMEX> and circuses without the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bread</ENAMEX>. And with a crappy little
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">circus</ENAMEX> that's got, like, maybe <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> trained <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donkey</ENAMEX> who isn't feeling very well.
Even <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX>'s most enthusiastic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supporters</ENAMEX> must admit that the early promise of
this program has been unfulfilled. "The conquest of space has moved ahead with
breath-taking speed since the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Space Age</ENAMEX> began on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 4, 1957</TIMEX>," says
the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1960</TIMEX> edition of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Book</ENAMEX> , without shame because it's just an
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inanimate</ENAMEX> object and can't feel shame, unlike some kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Space World</ENAMEX>
Book of the future that will know all human emotions and will be perfected
any minute. "On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that day</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> launched the first true space
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">traveler</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">chain-smoking dog</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laika</ENAMEX>, who, after befouling his kennel and
biting his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trainer</ENAMEX> on the ass, was rocketed aloft in a spacesuit filled with
his own urine," it does not add. I've always favored the alternative
plan--small, unmanned probes, along with a gigantic annual <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bonfire</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1,000</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bills</ENAMEX> folded into origami <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cranes</ENAMEX>. A-OK!

            On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> high-resolution image of the
Earth taken by a commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">satellite</ENAMEX> was made public.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Space Imaging Inc.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Thornton</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX>, released a
photo taken by a satellite <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">400 miles</NUMEX> above <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">D.C.</ENAMEX> The image of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington Monument</ENAMEX> and the surrounding area is as crisp and detailed as some
military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spy</ENAMEX> satellite photographs.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinton</ENAMEX>

expect to orbit their own satellites by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</TIMEX>. These cameras can resolve
objects as small as <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 feet</NUMEX> wide, accurate enough to show a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> or a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> but
not a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>, although you could make out the cloud of evil roiling around the
