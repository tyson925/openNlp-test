                  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fight Club</ENAMEX>
                (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">th Century Fox</ENAMEX>). Strong
reactions--positive and negative--to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Fincher</ENAMEX>'s ( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seven</ENAMEX> )
film about a underground bare-knuckles fighting group born as a response to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>'s feelings of disenfranchisement. "What's most troubling about this witless
mishmash of whiny, infantile philosophizing and bone-crunching violence is the
increasing realization that it actually thinks it's saying something of
significance" (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth Turan</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los Angeles Times</ENAMEX> ). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger Ebert</ENAMEX> of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicago Sun-Times</ENAMEX> derides it as a "frankly and cheerfully fascist
big-star movie," labels the violence "macho porn," and frets that though
"sensible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> know that if you hit someone with an ungloved hand hard
enough, you're going to end up with broken bones, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fight Club</ENAMEX>
have fists of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steel</ENAMEX>, and hammer one another while the sound effects <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> beat
the hell out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Naugahyde</ENAMEX> sofas with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ping-Pong</ENAMEX> paddles." A few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> rave.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Janet Maslin</ENAMEX>, for one, dismisses other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reviewers</ENAMEX> for
misunderstanding the film: "If watched sufficiently mindlessly, it might be
mistaken for a dangerous endorsement of totalitarian tactics and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">super-</ENAMEX>violent
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nihilism</ENAMEX> in an all-out assault on society," but she sees it instead as an
investigation of "the lure of violence in an even more dangerously regimented,
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">dehumanized</ENAMEX> culture." <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Ansen</ENAMEX> is more ambivalent, saying
it's "alternately amazing and annoying ... an outrageous mixture of brilliant
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">technique</ENAMEX>, puerile philosophizing, trenchant satire and sensory overload." The
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> point of agreement: <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Stars Brad Pitt</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward Norton</ENAMEX> earn strong marks.

                  The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Story of Us</ENAMEX>
                (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Polygram Filmed Entertainment</ENAMEX>).
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Critics</ENAMEX> gag on this cornball story of a marriage on the rocks, starring <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Willis</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michelle Pfeiffer</ENAMEX> and directed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rob Reiner</ENAMEX>. "Though it sets out to
explain why this marriage is worth saving, [it] could prompt even single
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> to file for divorce" (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maslin</ENAMEX>, the New York
Times ). Its main defect: Although the movie tries for the same combination
of whimsy and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">insight Reiner</ENAMEX> captured in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">When Harry Met Sally ...</ENAMEX> ,
there's no chemistry between <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Willis</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pfeiffer</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Owen Gleiberman</ENAMEX> is the film's
sole <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supporter</ENAMEX>, praising it as "pungent, funny, and surprisingly forceful"
Entertainment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Weekly</ENAMEX> ). (Find out more about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Willis</ENAMEX> here and about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pfeiffer</ENAMEX>

                  The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Straight Story</ENAMEX>
                (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buena Vista Pictures</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lynch</ENAMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Blue Velvet, Lost Highway</ENAMEX> ) shocks everyone by directing a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G-</ENAMEX>rated
film of the sweet, true story of a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">73-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmer</ENAMEX> who drives <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">300 miles</NUMEX> on a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lawnmower</ENAMEX> to visit his sick <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX>. Even more surprising, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> rank this
among <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lynch</ENAMEX>'s best work: It's his "first movie since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blue Velvet</ENAMEX> that
truly envelops you in its spell ... a piece of celestial <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americana</ENAMEX>"
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gleiberman, Entertainment Weekly</ENAMEX> ). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maslin</ENAMEX> calls it "a supremely
improbable triumph," all the more powerful because the film's "wholesome
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">radiance</ENAMEX> and soothing natural beauty are distinctly at odds with the famously
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unwholesome Lynch</ENAMEX> imagination" (the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> ). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Turan</ENAMEX> is the only
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> who hears the faint sucking of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dennis Hopper</ENAMEX>'s oxygen mask in the
background, calling the film "too mannered and weird around the edges to be
convincing" (the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los Angeles Times</ENAMEX> ). (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lynchnet</ENAMEX> has a page devoted
to the film complete with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trailers</ENAMEX> and pictures shot on location.)

            

               
                  The Limey
                (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Artisan Entertainment</ENAMEX>). "Like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pablo</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Picasso thrillingly</ENAMEX> exploding old notions of how we perceive faces and wine
bottles, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven Soderbergh</ENAMEX> thrillingly splinters time and action" in
this "small cubist masterpiece," exclaims <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Entertainment Weekly</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Lisa</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schwarzbaum</ENAMEX>. Few others go so far in their praise, but most express a certain
awe at this <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">'60s</TIMEX>-style revenge movie starring <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Terence Stamp</ENAMEX> as an ex-con out to
whack his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boyfriend</ENAMEX> and probable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">killer</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Fonda</ENAMEX>). A few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX>
find the time-splintering distracting and annoying, asking, "Is he working out
a new form of visual storytelling, or has the ever-so-promising <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of
sex, lies, and videotape lost his <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chops</ENAMEX> and his marbles<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">?</ENAMEX>" (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard</ENAMEX>
Corliss, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> ). (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Click</ENAMEX> here to watch an interview with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> about The

                  Motherless
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brooklyn</ENAMEX>
               , by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jonathan Lethem</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Doubleday</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lethem</ENAMEX>'s latest
genre-bending novel, featuring a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brooklyn</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">detective</ENAMEX> afflicted with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tourette</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">syndrome</ENAMEX>, impresses the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX>. "Taking his cue from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Don DeLillo</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philip K. Dick</ENAMEX>, who successfully blurred the lines between serious and
popular novels, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lethem</ENAMEX> is like a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX> in a candy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX>, grabbing all the tasty
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">plots</ENAMEX> and gimmicks he can" (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albert Mobilio</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times Book</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Review</ENAMEX> ). The heart of the book is the protagonist's affliction and his
constant verbal outbursts, which form "a barrage of sheer rhetorical invention
that has tour de force written all over it; it's an amazing stunt, and, just
when you think the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">well</ENAMEX> is running dry, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lethem</ENAMEX> keeps on topping himself"
( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kirkus Reviews</ENAMEX> ). A few call the punning Joycean literary outbursts
unrealistic, but most just take them in stride, admiring the "highly
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">artificial</ENAMEX>, flamboyantly bizarre world that constantly upstages its genre
format ... in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hero</ENAMEX> and his terrifying isolation from human
discourse are so vividly drawn that the novel becomes unexpectedly moving"
(<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Sullivan</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boston Globe</ENAMEX> ). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward Norton</ENAMEX> will produce and star
in the film version. (Read the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> chapter.)
