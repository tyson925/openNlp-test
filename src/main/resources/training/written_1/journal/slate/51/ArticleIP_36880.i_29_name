                  Dear
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudence</ENAMEX>,
               
            

            
               <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last weekend</TIMEX> a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">friend</ENAMEX> and her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> came to visit me for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few days</TIMEX>. This is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> I have
known for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25 years</TIMEX>, and although we've lived in different <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> for the last
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23 years</TIMEX>, we've always kept in touch and stayed fairly close. We had a great
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">weekend</ENAMEX>--saw the sights of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, ate out, etc. But <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> after they left
for <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX>, I found some damage had been done that they hadn't told me about. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">turntable</ENAMEX> in the microwave was chipped, and the toilet in their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bathroom</ENAMEX> was
clogged. Neither of these things in and of themselves bothers me. What does
bother me is that this lifelong <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> didn't have the courtesy to let me know
what had happened. Should I just let these things go in the name of preserving
the friendship? If not, what are my options?
            

            

               --<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C.S.</ENAMEX>
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dear C.</ENAMEX>,

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chums</ENAMEX> took the easy
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> out. It was not classy or first-rate, but it saved them what they perceived
to be embarrassment. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Avoidance</ENAMEX> is a rather common behavior ... some people
decide it's easier to skitter away than to 'fess up. Granted, it's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">left-footed</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">social</ENAMEX> behavior; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudie</ENAMEX> is not going to argue with you there. Your options,
however, depend on how strongly you feel about letting them know you know. If
you just can't stand to let it ride, then write a non-accusatory note saying
you were sad they didn't feel close enough to have mentioned the microwave or
the sluggish toilet. To lighten it up, you could add that all the repairs have
been made, and you look forward to their return visit. Think about it for a few
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>, then decide how you want to play it.

            
--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudie</ENAMEX>, tactfully

            
               
                  Dear
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudence</ENAMEX>,
               
            

            
               <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A year ago</TIMEX> my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cousin</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>
moved in with us. They were relocating from another <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> and needed a place to
live "for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few months</TIMEX>" while they got to know the area, and found jobs and a
place to live. They agreed to pay half the rent and attendant bills.
            

            
               Well, they're still
with us, and they never pay anything on time. They seem to think that junk food
qualifies as their <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">groceries</ENAMEX>. My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> and I keep the house
supplied with good <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX>, but we can't afford to support <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> grown <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>. We
also cannot stand their <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX>. (It's not housebroken, and it's full-grown.) We
have made subtle hints and mentioned that they need to start looking for their
own place. But they aren't catching on. How do we tell them to get out of our
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">house</ENAMEX> without causing family problems? We've always been close and don't want
to lose the friendship. They are using us, and I need help with this.
            

            

               --<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">T.M.</ENAMEX>
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dear T.</ENAMEX>,

            The "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>" are,
indeed, using you, but you've permitted it. Family problems seem a small price
to pay for evicting <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> junk-food-eating freeloaders with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> that uses your
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">house</ENAMEX> as a fire hydrant. Subtle hints won't cut it, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX>. You've got to insist
that the "temporary" situation--now at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12 months</TIMEX> and counting--has run its
course. They have overstayed their welcome and must be told to leave. Unless
the name of your <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ritz-Carlton</ENAMEX>, bag the subtle approach, and give them
a deadline for their departure. And do ask for a settling of accounts, as per
the original agreement. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudie</ENAMEX> is sputtering on your behalf and wishes you tons
of luck.

            
--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudie</ENAMEX>, insistently

            
               
                  Dear
Prudie,
               
            

            
               How long is a fair amount of time to date
someone before getting engaged? My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girlfriend</ENAMEX>, the love of my life for the last
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five years</TIMEX>, recently broke up with me because she felt our relationship had
gone on too long without any sign of future commitment. I always intended to
marry her and always reminded her of this when the topic came up. She feels
that if I truly loved her I would take her now before anyone else did. Since we
are both <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">only 24 years old</TIMEX>, I felt we shouldn't rush things, since we have the
rest of our lives to be together.
            

            
               What do you
think?
            

            

               --Left <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Long Before the Altar</ENAMEX>
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dear Left</ENAMEX>,

            Ah yes, which came first
... the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chicken</ENAMEX> or the engagement ring? <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Five years</TIMEX> with the love of your
life--whom you've always planned to marry--suggests that this would not be a
rush job. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudie</ENAMEX> thinks a fair amount of time to date someone before getting
engaged would be ... oh, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five years</TIMEX>. So hop to it and get her back with
whatever kind of engagement ring you can afford.

                  Dear
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudence</ENAMEX>,
               
            

            
               I just bought a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">seersucker</ENAMEX> suit and was wondering if you could give me some fashion tips on the
types of shoes, ties, shirts, and belts I should wear with it.
            

            

               --<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hot</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX>
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Dear Hot</ENAMEX>,

            You obviously have
Prudie confused with some other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">columnist</ENAMEX>, but just so it shouldn't be wasted
bandwidth, by all means wear any shoes, ties, shirts and belts that don't clash
with the suit.

            
--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudie</ENAMEX>, nattily

            
               
                  Dear
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudence</ENAMEX>,
               
            

            
               I am <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45 years old</TIMEX> and a former accomplished
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gymnast</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>. During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">my years</TIMEX> as a devoted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gymnast</ENAMEX>, I experienced several
damaging landings and falls during practice. Multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">surgeries</ENAMEX> have left me
somewhat "ambulatory impaired" and unable to wear skirts/dresses with high
heels. I am short in stature, wear a brace on my right lower leg, and have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
stainless-steel implants in my right ankle. Wearing a skirt or dress without
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pumps</ENAMEX> looks pathetic on me, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> tend to stare. Well-designed pantsuits
and formal pant-wear allow me to attend professional and social functions
without the appearance of an obvious handicap. My question: Why do so many
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> take offense at my wearing pants to the many functions I must
attend?
            

            
               Thanks!
            

            

               --<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Female Athlete</ENAMEX>
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dear Fem</ENAMEX>,

            Anyone who believes
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> wearing pants is incorrect is antediluvian. Even the stuffy dining <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX>
in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX>'s most WASPy clubs allow them. Plus, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Katharine Hepburn</ENAMEX> and Prudie
have been wearing them for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, so you are in good <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>.

            --<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudie</ENAMEX>, stylishly
