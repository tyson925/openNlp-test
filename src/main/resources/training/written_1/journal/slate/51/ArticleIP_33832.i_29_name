               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tim</ENAMEX>'s Wrap-Up
            

            What's on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX>?
Judging by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s responses, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX>'s lineup would seem to consist of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Jennings</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam Donaldson</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ted Koppel</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barbara Walters</ENAMEX>, grilling <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ellen</ENAMEX>
DeGeneres about her lesbianism while a bare-assed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Regis Philbin</ENAMEX> dispenses cash
and prizes. But there are so many other fine programs on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX> to mock. There is,
for instance, the increasingly annoying <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Sports Night</ENAMEX> , a sitcom that
combines the most irritating aspects of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Mamet</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirtysomething</TIMEX> .
Forthwith, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesperson</ENAMEX>'s remarks, as scripted <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">by Sports Night</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">contributor Aaron Sorkin</ENAMEX>:

            "It is simply untrue."

            "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Untrue</ENAMEX>?

            "Yes, untrue."

            "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Untrue</ENAMEX> in that none of it's true, or that some of
it's true?"

            "Untrue untrue."

            "Yes, but what I'm saying, what I'm asking, is
whether any of it's true."

            "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">No.</ENAMEX>"

            "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">No?</ENAMEX>"

            "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">No.</ENAMEX>"

            "Date rape is bad."

            "Yes."

            The rumor that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX> was
heatedly denying was that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jamie Tarses</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX>'s entertainment
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">division</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> Magazine cover subject, would be leaving the
network. In an entirely unrelated development, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX> and parent company <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Disney</ENAMEX>
have come under fire for a promotion run by their KLOS-FM radio station, in
which morning disc <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">jockeys</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brian</ENAMEX> offered dark gardening implements to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">callers</ENAMEX>. The implements were referred to as "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Black Hoes</ENAMEX>." (I don't have a joke
here; I just wanted to give it more publicity.)
