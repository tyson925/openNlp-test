            I didn't want to go to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malaysia</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Malaysian</ENAMEX>
government would surely expect me to deliver a stronger endorsement of its
heterodox economic program than I was prepared to offer. And, of course, it
would try to use me politically--to provide a veneer of respectability to a
regime that has lately developed the habit of putting inconvenient <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in
jail. But sometimes an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> has to do what an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> has to do. Since I
had been the only high-profile <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> to advocate the economic heresy that
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malaysia</ENAMEX> had put into practice, sooner or later I would have to face the music.
And so <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last month</TIMEX> I agreed to spend a day--including a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">90-minute</TIMEX> "dialogue"
with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prime minister</ENAMEX>--at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Palace of the Golden Horses</ENAMEX>, a vaguely <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vegas</ENAMEX>-style <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> outside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuala Lumpur</ENAMEX>.

            Some background here:
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Malaysian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prime Minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mahathir Mohamad</ENAMEX> has been the wild <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asian</ENAMEX>
crisis, blaming all his problems on manipulations by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speculators</ENAMEX>,
denouncing the prescriptions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Monetary Fund</ENAMEX> as part of a
Western conspiracy to recolonize <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX>, and so on. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early days</TIMEX> of the
crisis, his position seemed absurd, and it was easy to make fun of him--which I
did, right in 
                  Slate
               . But eventually it stopped being so easy to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dismiss Mahathir</ENAMEX>'s views. For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> thing, the crisis turned out to be worse than
anyone had imagined possible, and anyone with an open mind began to suspect
that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMF</ENAMEX>'s initial policies had been misconceived. For another, while the
vast conspiracy <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mahathir</ENAMEX> envisaged was a figment of his imagination (I know the
supposed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conspirators</ENAMEX>, and they aren't that smart), a few hedge funds really
did engage in concerted manipulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>'s markets in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX> of
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mahathir</ENAMEX> still has a distorted view of the way the world works--more on
that below--but then so do the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">free-capital-market faithful</ENAMEX>.

            Where do I fit in? In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer of 1998</TIMEX>, I began to
reconsider my own views about the crisis. The scope of global "contagion"--the
rapid spread of the crisis to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> with no real economic links to the
original <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victim</ENAMEX>--convinced me that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeffrey Sachs</ENAMEX> were right
in insisting that this was less a matter of economic fundamentals than it was a
case of self-fulfilling prophecy, of market panic that, by causing a collapse
of the real economy, ends up validating itself. But I also concluded that the
threat of further capital flight would prevent <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asian</ENAMEX> economies from simply
reflating, that is, increasing public spending and cutting interest rates to
get their economies growing again. And so I found myself advocating temporary
restrictions on the ability of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> to pull money out of crisis
economies--a curfew, if you like, on capital flight--as part of a recovery
strategy.

            Now, it turned out that
just at the time that I went public with those views, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mahathir</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisers</ENAMEX>
were secretly working out a plan to impose capital controls as part of a
recovery strategy. According to what I have been told, my own public statement
played a small role in the final decision; essentially, some of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mahathir</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisers</ENAMEX> were worried by the absence of any support for such controls among
mainstream <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX>, but the appearance of my <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August</TIMEX> manifesto in
Fortune silenced the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doubters</ENAMEX>. Almost surely, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malaysia</ENAMEX> would have gone
ahead with the plan anyway; but I had, inadvertently, found myself one of the
few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">outsiders</ENAMEX> to express any kind of support. I quickly put out an open letter
to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mahathir</ENAMEX> warning that the controls should not be abused, used as a cover for
; but I know from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> started referring to the
"<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krugman-Mahathir</ENAMEX> strategy" of recovery via capital controls. And so I really
could not avoid going to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malaysia</ENAMEX> to discuss those controls, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> after they
had been imposed.

            I  arrived at a moment of celebration. When the controls
were put on, many Western <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> predicted disaster: a collapse of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">economy</ENAMEX>, hyperinflation, rampant black markets. It didn't happen. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Two days</TIMEX>
before I arrived, the latest statistics had confirmed that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malaysia</ENAMEX> was in fact
experiencing a fairly strong economic recovery. The actual implementation of
the controls had been careful and selective, and important economic
reforms--such as strengthening the banking system--had, if anything,
accelerated after the new policy was introduced. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A few days</TIMEX> after my visit,
restrictions on removing money from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> were eased and hardly any money
was pulled out. So, I guess the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Malaysians</ENAMEX> expected me to join them in a mutual
admiration society. Surely they were disappointed when I expressed some
skepticism about the payoff from the controls.

            But the truth is that
while <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malaysia</ENAMEX>'s recovery has proved the hysterical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponents</ENAMEX> of capital
controls wrong, it has not exactly proved the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">proponents</ENAMEX> right. For there is a
recovery in progress throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Korea</ENAMEX>, which did not impose
controls (though it did get an early and crucial rescheduling of its foreign
debt) has bounced back with stunning speed; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Thailand</ENAMEX> is growing, too; even
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indonesia</ENAMEX> has bottomed out. In general, the market panic of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997-98</TIMEX> was, it
turns out, coming to an end just about the time that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malaysia</ENAMEX> decided to make
its big break with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">orthodoxy</ENAMEX>. You can argue that the controls may have allowed
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malaysia</ENAMEX> to recover faster, with less social cost, than it would have
otherwise. But the vindication that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mahathir</ENAMEX> probably imagined for himself--a
triumphant recovery in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malaysia</ENAMEX>, while its more orthodox <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> continued to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">languish</ENAMEX>--hasn't quite played out.

            What, then, are the lessons of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malaysia</ENAMEX>'s recovery? In our
staged "dialogue"--which was played out in semi-public, in front of a
disturbingly obsequious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred or so</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">businessmen</ENAMEX>--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mahathir</ENAMEX>
continued to sound a minor-key version of the conspiracy theme, insisting that
capital controls were necessary to protect small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> against the evil
designs of big <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speculators</ENAMEX>. That's an unfortunate emphasis: While there are big
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speculators</ENAMEX>, and they do sometimes make plays against vulnerable economies,
they are not the main reason that controls sometimes make sense. In general,
controls should be imposed to prevent panic rather than conspiracy, and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> who panic are, if anything, more likely to be respectable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bankers</ENAMEX> and
wealthy domestic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> than nefarious rootless cosmopolitans. (Indeed, even
the occasional market manipulation by big <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speculators</ENAMEX> wouldn't be possible if
it weren't for the possibility of generating a panic among other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX>; it
is a familiar point in the academic literature that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>-type speculative
plays can work only if the economy is vulnerable to self-fulfilling crisis in
the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> place.) And the emphasis on big foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speculators</ENAMEX> may encourage
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malaysia</ENAMEX> to control too much for too long. Panic is a sometime thing, but hedge
funds ye will always have with you.

            Nonetheless, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malaysia</ENAMEX> has
proved a point--namely, that controlling capital in a crisis is at least
feasible. Until the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Malaysian</ENAMEX> experiment, the prevailing view among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pundits</ENAMEX> was
that even if financial crises were driven by self-justifying panic, there was
nothing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> could do to curb that panic except to reschedule bank
debts--part, but only part, of the pool of potential flight capital--and
otherwise try to restore confidence by making a conspicuous display of virtue.
were the watchwords. The alternative--preventing capital flight directly, and
thereby gaining a breathing space--was supposed to be completely impossible,
with any attempt a sure recipe for disaster. Now we know better. Capital
controls are not necessarily the answer for every <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> that experiences a
financial crisis; sometimes confidence can be restored without the need for
coercive measures, and even when calming words fail, "burden sharing" by banks
and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lenders</ENAMEX> will often be enough. But it would now be foolish to rule out
controls as a measure of last resort.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mahathir</ENAMEX> can therefore claim a partial vindication for his
economic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heresies</ENAMEX>. That is not a political endorsement. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">right-wingers</ENAMEX> have
claimed that anyone with a good word for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Malaysian</ENAMEX> capital controls (me in
particular) is also in effect an accomplice in the imprisonment, on what
certainly sound like trumped-up charges, of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mahathir</ENAMEX>'s former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heir</ENAMEX> apparent
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anwar Ibrahim</ENAMEX>--an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocate</ENAMEX> of more conventional policies. Well, I still
remember <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the days</TIMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">left-wingers</ENAMEX> used to claim that anyone with a good word
for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chile</ENAMEX>'s free-market reforms had bloodstained hands, because he was in
effect endorsing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Augusto Pinochet</ENAMEX>. The point is that economics is not a
morality play. Sometimes bad <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> make good policies, and vice versa. And the
job of economic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> is, or ought to be, to assess the policies, without
regard to who makes them.

            The objective fact is that whatever you think of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mahathir</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malaysia</ENAMEX> has gotten away with its economic apostasy. You can question
whether that apostasy was necessary, but you cannot claim that it has been a
disaster--and you cannot disguise the fact that those who predicted disaster
were letting politics and ideology cloud their judgment.
