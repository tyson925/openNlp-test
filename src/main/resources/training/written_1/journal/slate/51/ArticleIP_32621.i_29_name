            It will be hard to frolic through the next
millennium with bones that have turned to sawdust. That is the fate that awaits
those of us, we are told, who don't consume the escalating amount of
calcium--now at a quart of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk</ENAMEX> a day or the equivalent--endorsed by public
health <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Just two years ago</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Academy of Sciences</ENAMEX> increased
its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> recommendation for calcium by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 percent</NUMEX> for older <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>. Another
upward revision and we will all have to be attached to udders with an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX>.
Strange, then, that most of the world's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, who rarely if ever drink milk
and who get just a small percentage of the calcium we are told is vital, have
not devolved into boneless heaps of protoplasm. Even stranger, in many of these
dairy-avoiding <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> get through life with far fewer of the
age-related hip fractures that plague <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>.

            This paradox has led a small number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX>
to become dairy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doubters</ENAMEX>, questioning the wisdom of the calcium recommendations
of the public health <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">establishment</ENAMEX>. For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> thing, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doubters</ENAMEX> say, our diet
is so fundamentally flawed that trying to protect our bones by taking in loads
of calcium is like trying to fill a tub with no stopper by turning up the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">faucets</ENAMEX>. The problem is this: In general, world dietary patterns show that
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> consume large amounts of calcium are also countries
where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> eat extravagant amounts of animal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, places such as the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX> and northern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. These <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> also suffer among the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">world</ENAMEX>'s highest rate of fractures due to osteoporosis, the disease
characterized by weak, porous bones. "The correlation between animal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>
[intake] and fracture rates in different <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">societies</ENAMEX> is as strong as that between
lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> and smoking," says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">T. Colin Campbell</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> of nutritional
biochemistry at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cornell University</ENAMEX>.

            Our bodies contain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">pounds to 4 pounds</NUMEX> of calcium, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99 percent</NUMEX> of which is in our bones and teeth,
the rest circulates in the blood where it is necessary for nervous-system
function. Eating animal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, which is high in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur</ENAMEX>-containing amino
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">acids</ENAMEX>, requires the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> to buffer the effects of those amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>. It does so
by releasing calcium from the bones, literally peeing them away. But this
leaching of calcium should be offset if the balance of calcium to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> in
the diet is within a reasonable range. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Heaney</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX> at
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Creighton University School of Medicine</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">proponent</ENAMEX> of high dairy
consumption, found in a study he co-authored that the "single most important
determinate of the rate of bone gain" in young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> was not the amount of
calcium consumed but the ratio of calcium to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. But it's a difficult
balance to strike when it's common for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> to eat double the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> we
need, with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70 percent</NUMEX> of it coming from animal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>.

            Could there be some other dietary factor at work as well?
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Retired Harvard</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> of nutrition <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark Hegsted</ENAMEX> thinks there may be. He
believes calcium consumption may be at the root of our bone problems, but his
heretical hypothesis is not that we don't get enough calcium but rather that we
get too much. In an article in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal of Nutrition</ENAMEX> he writes,
"[H]ip fractures are more frequent in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> where dairy products are
commonly consumed and calcium intakes are relatively high. Is there any
possibility that this is a causal relationship?"

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hegsted</ENAMEX> explains the way
such a mechanism would work. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> adapts to low calcium intake by
efficiently using what is available. Conversely, high calcium consumption
causes the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> to decrease the amount of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mineral</ENAMEX> that is absorbed,
excreting the excess. That's why <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> with low calcium consumption
manage to form healthy skeletons, and high calcium <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> don't develop
bones like mastodons. But what happens over time, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hegsted</ENAMEX> suggests, is that the
inefficient <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> may permanently damage their abilities to effectively use
dietary calcium and to conserve calcium in the bones later in life. As we age,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> naturally goes from building bone to losing it. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hegsted</ENAMEX>'s hypothesis
explains why high dairy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> so often end up with rampant bone loss. He
cites studies of rural <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Gambian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> who don't drink <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk</ENAMEX>, get about
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">one-quarter</ENAMEX> of the calcium we're told to consume, yet rarely have osteoporotic
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fractures</ENAMEX>. "It will be embarrassing enough if the current calcium hype is
simply useless; it will be immeasurably worse if the recommendations are
actually detrimental to health," he writes.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cornell</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campbell</ENAMEX> says our fate could be different if we
would take a lesson from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> (fortunately he's a nutritionist, not a
political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientist</ENAMEX>). He has spent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last 20 years</TIMEX> studying the health and
dietary habits of rural <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> and comparing them to those in the West. These
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> consume <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than half</NUMEX> the calcium we're told is necessary, virtually
all of it from plant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>, in particular leafy green <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetables</ENAMEX>. They have
one-fifth the incidence of hip fracture of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>. Although they consume
more calories per day than we do, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only about 10 percent</NUMEX> of their diet is from
animal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>. On average, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diets</ENAMEX> are <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70 percent</NUMEX> animal-based.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campbell</ENAMEX> has what could
be called the unified field theory of bones and breasts. He explains the mortal
consequences of diets high in dairy, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, and fat. Early in life, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> consume lots of these, which leads to relatively dense bones, high levels
of estrogen, and early sexual maturation. The age of menarche has been dropping
for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX> in this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> and now often occurs <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">as early as age 10</TIMEX>. In rural
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> don't usually begin menstruation until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 15</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> have
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only about two-thirds</NUMEX> of the amount of circulating estrogen that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX> women
do, which helps account for their far lower rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX>, says
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campbell</ENAMEX>.

            Estrogen helps maintain bone, so most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>'s skeletons are
fine until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">menopause</TIMEX>. Then estrogen levels drop, in the case of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX> women
faster and lower than their <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterparts</ENAMEX>. "Now they're vulnerable,"
says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campbell</ENAMEX>. "That all suggests that the factors that cause osteoporosis are
rather similar to the ones that cause <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX>."

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> very different sets of studies support his
theory. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> compares bone density of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japanese</ENAMEX>
get almost all their calcium from soy, the bones of small cooked <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetables</ENAMEX>. They also have <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 40 percent</NUMEX> the rate of hip fracture of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> diet is similar to ours and so is their hip fracture rate.
Before menopause, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> do indeed have denser bones than the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX>. But following menopause, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> end up losing more bone
than the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX>. And a spate of recent studies in this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> has found that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> with the highest measured bone density, a much-desired goal according to
the literature on osteoporosis, have a significantly increased incidence of
<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campbell</ENAMEX> says views such
as his are not more widely known because, "Unfortunately, we are absolutely
drowned in information coming out of the dairy industry. ... Our national
nutrition policies are corrupted by the influence of the dairy industry."

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">proponents</ENAMEX> offer a variety of responses as to why
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">osteoporosis</ENAMEX> is far less common in the nonmilk-drinking world. One is that the
theories of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doubters</ENAMEX> could be characterized as demented ravings, probably
induced by dairy <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">deficiency</ENAMEX>. Another boils down to: "We're <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>. If we
were rural <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gambians</ENAMEX>, sure we'd be eating primarily <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beans</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetables</ENAMEX>, so thank goodness we aren't." The public health <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX>'s version
of the line, "Take my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>, please," is "Tell <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> to eat kale <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> times
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a week</TIMEX>."

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk</ENAMEX> advocates
rightly point out that physical activity, particularly the kind that requires
weight-bearing, is crucial to bone growth and maintenance. For example, while
we have turned our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bathrooms</ENAMEX> into <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palaces</ENAMEX> of comfort, lots of the world's
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> still squat over holes, which makes it difficult to finish reading the
business section, but is a real bone <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">builder</ENAMEX>. Another theory holds that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asian</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> in particular have better designed hips than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Caucasians</ENAMEX>, making them like
inflatable punching toys that can't be knocked down, thus less likely to suffer
hip fractures. The problem with this theory is that recent studies show that
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> diet is rapidly becoming more <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Westernized</ENAMEX>. Guess what, so is the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> rate of osteoporosis.

            But most of all, they say, forget population statistics and
instead look at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX>. Indeed, there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozens</NUMEX> of clinical
experiments showing that high doses of calcium either arrest bone loss or even
build bone in older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fine</ENAMEX>, say the dairy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doubters</ENAMEX>, if calcium is the
answer, then it should both prevent and cure osteoporosis, but it doesn't. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">doubters</ENAMEX> also argue that these laboratory studies, which usually run from two
to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four years</TIMEX>, may just be seeing a short-term effect. That is, there is some
initial bone-building response by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> to large calcium doses, but it may
be a temporary and unsustainable change.

            Which <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camp</ENAMEX> is right has
enormous public health consequences. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Eight million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 million</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> have osteoporosis. The disease is responsible for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 1.5 million</NUMEX>
fractures <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annually</TIMEX>, with a direct cost of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$14 billion</NUMEX>. Of those, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300,000</NUMEX> are
hip fractures; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one-third</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 50</TIMEX> who break their hips never
walk independently again, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 percent</NUMEX> die within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> from related
complications. With an aging <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, and in the absence of some plumbing
apocalypse that will cause <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> to adopt a squatting posture to relieve
themselves, the incidence and cost of osteoporosis can only rise.

            In a way, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> are voting with their stomachs on the
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk</ENAMEX> issue and unintentionally siding with the dairy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponents</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Milk</ENAMEX>
consumption has been falling for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX>. It is now <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about half</NUMEX> what it was in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1945</TIMEX>. Other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beverages</ENAMEX> have displaced it--in the case of young people
especially, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">soft drinks</ENAMEX>. Soft <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drinks</ENAMEX> are loaded with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">phosphorus</ENAMEX>, which is an
essential and widely available nutrient. The problem is that too much
phosphorus itself causes calcium to be lost from the bones. Then there's excess
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">salt</ENAMEX>, another component of the average diet and a bone-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">killer</ENAMEX> as well.

            The battle between the vegetable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocates</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dairy</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocates</ENAMEX> over the nutritional choices of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> is like symphony
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">orchestras</ENAMEX> dueling with opera <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> over the entertainment dollars of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teen-agers</ENAMEX>. While they're fighting, they forgot to notice the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> is at
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Pie</ENAMEX> . So it turns out that no matter who is right, the calcium
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doubters</ENAMEX> or the calcium <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocates</ENAMEX>, that shattering sound you will hear as the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21 st century</TIMEX> progresses will be <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>'s bones.
