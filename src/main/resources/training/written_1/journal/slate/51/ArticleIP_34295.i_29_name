            Murderous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gangs</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Timor</ENAMEX>, deadly bombings in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caucasus</ENAMEX>, scary tumors in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cardinal</ENAMEX>

runaway parade floats plowing into the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX> and yet not crushing a single
presidential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX>--so much news and so little time, the effect of the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> schedule on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News Quiz</ENAMEX>--which, incidentally, you can play all week
without paying <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> sales tax or showering or even getting out of your
pajamas: Such is our end-of-<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> malaise. Or perhaps it's just a perverse
disappointment that the anxiously anticipated NQ3C problem was no problem at
all. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX>'s publication of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News Quiz</ENAMEX> question No. 300 resulted in no fiery
eruption on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Strom Thurmond</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Greenspan</ENAMEX>'s ... well, never mind. I'm sure
we all did the best we could, although many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>, absorbed with the
idea of burning heretics, seem to have confused the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C of E</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RC</ENAMEX>, so
let's all reread <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Barchester Towers</ENAMEX> and study up on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gordon</ENAMEX> riots,
with our trousers down around our ankles.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">schoolmasters</ENAMEX> want the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> to lift the
ban on their fundamental human right to hit <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> with a stick.

            On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sept. 1</TIMEX>, school beatings were banned from
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>'s private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>, bringing them in line with state-run <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> where
caning was outlawed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13 years ago</TIMEX>.

            "I believe the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> should not intervene in
how <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> bring up their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>. This is dictatorial and an example of the
nanny <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philip Williamson</ENAMEX>, headmaster of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> Fellowship
School in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Liverpool</ENAMEX>, which is leading the protest. "It's a slippery slope.
First you can't thrash them, next you can't give them a good boot in the ribs,
then no summary executions of the really impertinent ones," he did not add, nor
did he emphasize his point by menacingly slapping his palm with the "Fellowship
Stick," as he does not call it since it does not exist.

            A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokeswoman</ENAMEX> for
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Education</ENAMEX> was unimpressed with the spanking-obsessed
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">schoolmasters</ENAMEX>. "The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Union</ENAMEX> is itself against corporal punishment so it
is unlikely to uphold any arguments that the new provision against caning is an
infringement of human rights,'' she said
