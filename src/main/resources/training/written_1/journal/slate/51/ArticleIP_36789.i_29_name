               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Randy</ENAMEX>'s Wrap-Up
            

            The temptation is to write a sneering comparison of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rural</ENAMEX> and urban life. You know: fresh air/fresh ideas; you have to drive at
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">least 20 minutes</TIMEX> to get anywhere/you already are somewhere; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pizza</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hut/pizza</ENAMEX>--that sort of thing. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">And</ENAMEX>, incidentally, sneering comparisons are a
big part of the next round of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SATs</ENAMEX>. Bring a No. 2 pencil and a look of
disdain.)

            Another way to go was present you with an old
favorite series or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>, like this <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX>, S ...; and this <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14, 18, 23</TIMEX>,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28, 34, 42, 50</TIMEX> ...

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">A third</NUMEX> plan was to note that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>
refused to grant a permit for an anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Klan</ENAMEX> rally because, since it had just
banned a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Klan</ENAMEX> rally, there was no need for anyone to express an opinion on the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Klan</ENAMEX>. This would have been hard to tie in to the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Series of Cities</ENAMEX> question, but
no harder than it was for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> to tie it in to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">First Amendment</ENAMEX>. I'm
pretty sure we both could have pulled it off through some kind of sneering
comparison. But it sort of takes the edge off my urban boasting.

               Over <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">6 Billion</NUMEX> Served
Answer
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX> completes the list in ascending order of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">world</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> largest metropolitan areas, coming in with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 28 million</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Population buffs</ENAMEX> know
that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX> marked the arrival of the world's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> billionth <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>. (So if you
had <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Oct. 12, 1999</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slovenca Vladic, Sarajevo</ENAMEX>, in the pool, come by and collect
your <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prize</ENAMEX>.) Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> fun facts from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Earth Action Network</ENAMEX>:

            

               It took all of human history to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1800</TIMEX> to reach the first <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">billion</NUMEX>.

               The world's population has doubled since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1960</TIMEX>.

               <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Baby</ENAMEX> No. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 billion</NUMEX> was born in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</TIMEX>, and he still leaves his stuff all over
the floor, unless he was born in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX>, in which case he probably has
no stuff. And no floor.

               <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Twenty percent</NUMEX> of the world's population owns <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80 percent</NUMEX> of its wealth, a
gap that is widening.

               Rates of growth are declining except in the poorest parts of the world,
particularly <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX>.

               In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX>, half the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> is under <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>.

               <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Africa</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> for every <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>.

               Family planning has been successful in slowing the rate of growth, but
there is resistance from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> where some <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> oppose these programs.
