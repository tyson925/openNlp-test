               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Randy</ENAMEX>'s Wrap-Up
            

            When you live an isolated life at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>
or in a maximum security <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prison</ENAMEX> or in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Patricia Duff</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX>, you are bound to be
out of touch. That's one argument against letting money buy access to power.
Even if he remains uncorrupted, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> will be immersed in the concerns
only of the wealthy and will lose all feeling for the lives of everyone else.
It is an argument for requiring those who run the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">subway system</ENAMEX> to come to work
on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX> and not in a limo, for public <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> to send their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> to
public <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>, and for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dentists</ENAMEX> to work on their own teeth with some kind of
complicated mirror system and a stiff shot of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bourbon</ENAMEX>. Some of these arguments
make sense.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> measure of attachment to ordinary life: Does
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> carry a wallet? I wrote to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jimmy Carter</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 1980</TIMEX>, asking
this question. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel M. Chew</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of presidential correspondence,
couldn't--or wouldn't--say.

            "However, you might like to know that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">President</ENAMEX>
and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> pay for all of their personal expenses. I would imagine they use
checks rather than cash for such purposes.

            "Since <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carter</ENAMEX>'s appearance in stores
would attract undue attention, merchandise is sometimes brought to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> by invitation. In an effort to avoid appearing to be partial to selected
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">competitors</ENAMEX>, no details about brand names or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> are made public."

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> used a cordless electric
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">screwdriver</ENAMEX> to help assemble a computer desk at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Coleman</ENAMEX> Place <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Elementary</ENAMEX>
School in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Norfolk</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Va.</ENAMEX>, to demonstrate--I dunno--cordless electric
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">screwdriving</ENAMEX>?

            It was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Labor Day</TIMEX>; he was laboring--indeed he wore a
hard hat to assemble what was basically IKEA furniture--and he wanted to
dramatize his call to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> to fund the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> or upgrading of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6,000</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> spent <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about five minutes</TIMEX> at his task,
failing to complete it; the desk was finished by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">volunteers</ENAMEX> from a construction
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trade</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">union</ENAMEX>.

            "I'm pro-business, but
I'm pro-labor, too. I don't think you can help the economy if you hurt the
working <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>," he said. "But I'll try. I've hurt them pretty bad so far. By
continuing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX>'s policies, the richest <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1 percent</NUMEX>--<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX> like me--now have as
much after-tax income as the bottom <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">100 million</NUMEX>!" he did not add.

What?

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. What does he "feel an urgency" to do to the
weak?

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. For him, there is only one thing deserving of
hate. What?

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. What kind of moment are we at in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
history?

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>. What is happening to the nature of work?

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>. At what rate is the world changing?

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>. Does the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Jones</ENAMEX> measure a young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX>'s
smile?

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>. Does the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Jones</ENAMEX> measure a young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX>'s first
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">handshake</ENAMEX>?

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>. Does the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Jones</ENAMEX> measure a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandmother</ENAMEX>'s
pride?

            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>. How many kinds of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> are there?

            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>. Which kind is Bill

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. Complacency.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. Strengthen them.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. Hate itself. (But partial credit if you said the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX> fall lineup.)

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. A special moment. (Not that you could tell from
those jerks at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX>.)

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>. It's changing. (But don't expect anything better
from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC</ENAMEX>.)

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>. A dazzling rate. (Unlike a certain form of mass
entertainment.)

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>. No.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>. No.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>. Yes. Oh, wait, no. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sorry</ENAMEX>. I dozed off there for
a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>.)

            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>. "There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> kinds of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX>, maybe
more." (Maybe <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a zillion</NUMEX>?)

            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>. The good kind. I
think that's No. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. (And those little upstarts <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fox</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WB</ENAMEX> and UPN:
innovation, my ass.)

            

               Clarification
            

            While nothing in the
