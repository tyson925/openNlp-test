            <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Argentina</ENAMEX> used to be a place of legendary political
irresponsibility, where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generals</ENAMEX> in funny hats declared war on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Margaret</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populist politicians</ENAMEX> who promised paradise consistently delivered
hyperinflation instead. But over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past 10 years</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carlos Menem</ENAMEX> has
steadily turned the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>'s reputation around. Inflation has been eliminated,
with the peso securely pegged to the dollar. An absurdly inefficient system of
protected markets and money-losing public <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporations</ENAMEX> has been liberalized and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">privatized</ENAMEX>, producing a fair bit of unemployment but a huge surge in
productivity. And <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">as recently as five or six months ago</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> was the
darling of the business press, praised for its success in riding out the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">world</ENAMEX>'s financial storms.

            As usual, however, good
press was the sign that things were about to take a turn for the worse. For a
variety of reasons, including the devaluation in neighboring <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brazil</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Argentina</ENAMEX>
has been sliding into a moderately severe recession and with it a growing
budget deficit, just as a presidential election approaches. And in apparent
desperation over his lag in the polls, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eduardo Duhalde</ENAMEX>, the Peronist
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX>--the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX>, in other words, of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Menem</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX>, which brought
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Argentina</ENAMEX> its unaccustomed stability--startled everyone by announcing his
intention to discuss possible debt relief for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Argentina</ENAMEX>. Not with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX>,
mind you, but with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pope</ENAMEX>. (The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pope</ENAMEX> has recently joined the call for debt
forgiveness for poor <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nations</ENAMEX>, but he was surely talking about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fourth World</ENAMEX>
economies such as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mozambique</ENAMEX>, not relatively well-off places such as
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Argentina</ENAMEX>.)

            You have to admit that it is pretty funny. Surely the Monty
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Python</ENAMEX> cast is about to leap into view, shouting "Nobody expects the
<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Spanish Inquisition</ENAMEX>!" But somehow, the markets didn't appreciate the humor: The
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Buenos Aires</ENAMEX> stock market plunged, and the interest rate on <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Argentine</ENAMEX> bonds
soared.

            The odds are that this
whole affair will soon blow over. But even assuming that the peso holds and
that things don't fall apart, there is still a serious lesson in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Argentina</ENAMEX>'s
current travails--namely, that you can scratch <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> more supposed economic
panacea off your list. For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Argentina</ENAMEX> has been the role model for those who
believe that a credibly stable currency is all you need to promote prosperity.
And its troubles--especially the contrast with the unexpectedly good news from
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brazil</ENAMEX>--are therefore a reminder that, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Maynard Keynes</ENAMEX> pointed out way
back in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1920s</TIMEX>, a strong currency and a strong economy are by no means the
same thing.

            Now, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Argentina</ENAMEX> does, by law (the so-called "convertibility
law"), have an undeniably strong currency. A peso is worth <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a U.S. dollar</NUMEX>, and
that promise is made credible by the legal requirement that every peso in
circulation be backed by a dollar's worth of foreign exchange reserves. In
other words, short of actually abandoning its own currency in favor of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
dollar--a measure that has been discussed quite a bit lately--<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Argentina</ENAMEX> has
done everything possible to make that currency credible and secure. This
"currency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX>" system was introduced in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX>, when hyperinflation was a
recent memory and most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> expected it to return in due course, and you can
make a reasonable case that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Argentina</ENAMEX> should stick with its currency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> for
some time to come. (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Domingo Cavallo</ENAMEX>, who as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">finance minister</ENAMEX> was the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX>
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX>, suggested <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few months</TIMEX> back that it should endure for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a decade</TIMEX> or
so.) But you can no longer brush off the argument that the system is a sort of
economic straitjacket, one that is becoming increasingly onerous.

            The problem, you see, is
that the same rules that prevent <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Argentina</ENAMEX> from printing money for bad
reasons--to pay for populist schemes or foolish wars--also prevent it from
printing money for good reasons such as fighting recessions or rescuing the
financial system. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Argentina</ENAMEX> came very close to financial collapse in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX> when
it turned out that the convertibility law left no leeway to rush cash to
troubled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX>. It has since established various safety nets to prevent a
repeat of that crisis, but some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observers</ENAMEX> doubt whether those nets are really
strong enough. And now the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> faces what is basically a garden-variety
recession, the sort of thing that happens to every economy <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">now and then</TIMEX>--except
that unlike the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, or even a similar-sized First World <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> such
as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australia</ENAMEX>, it cannot try to cushion the slump by lowering interest rates and
pushing more money into the system.

            Now, these problems with a rigidly fixed exchange rate are
not news. But for a while, managed to convince themselves that they weren't
significant. They argued that as long as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> themselves followed stable
policies--and as long as the economy was sufficiently "flexible" (the
all-purpose answer to economic difficulties)--there would be few serious
recessions.

            But it turns out that
history does not stop just because the currency is stable. And faced with a
politically inconvenient recession, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peronists</ENAMEX> find that there is nothing
they can do. They cannot print money. They cannot even borrow money for some
employment-generating public spending, because <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal indiscipline</TIMEX> would
undermine the peso's hard-won credibility. You can understand why <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Duhalde</ENAMEX> might
be tempted to appeal to a higher authority.

            Of course, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Argentina</ENAMEX>'s economic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> still believes that
its system is better than the alternatives. The more sensible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocates</ENAMEX> of
currency boards and, if necessary, dollarization, have always based their views
less on hope than on fear--fear that any attempt to fight a recession by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">devaluing</ENAMEX> would lead instead to a surge in inflation and a financial collapse.
But, as it turns out, their fears may have been almost as overstated as their
hopes. When <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brazil</ENAMEX>--whose economic history is nearly as dismal as
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Argentina</ENAMEX>'s--finally devalued in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January</TIMEX>, the predicted hyperinflation never
arrived and neither did the financial meltdown. Indeed, it is starting to look
as if the collapse of the real was just what the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> ordered.

            The serious lesson of the antics in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Argentina</ENAMEX>,
then, is that the big issues of monetary economics--fixed vs. flexible exchange
rates, whether <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> should have independent currencies at all--are still
wide open. It's an eternal controversy, and not even the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pope</ENAMEX> can resolve
it.
