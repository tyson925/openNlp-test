Wrap-Up
            

            Like cartoon
superheroes, each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> has but a single attribute, generally as useless as
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Green Lantern</ENAMEX>'s illuminability, or greenability, or whatever freakish power
he had. Has? Had? Is he still running? <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Forbes</ENAMEX> is rich. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pat Buchanan</ENAMEX> is
cruel. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George W.</ENAMEX> is hollow. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Gore</ENAMEX> is wooden. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elizabeth Dole</ENAMEX> lacks
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">spontaneity</ENAMEX>, which is a lot like being wooden only if you poured a few drinks
into her, she'd loosen up, but he'd dissolve in some hideous yet unspectacular
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chemical</ENAMEX> reaction. But just as most comic book <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> move on to other forms
of literature (despite <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Art Spiegelman</ENAMEX>'s unconvincing plea that "they're really
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">illustrated</ENAMEX> novels"), most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> in a mature democracy demand more from
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> than a packaged personality and a glib slogan. Wait, sorry, excuse
me--as it turns out, no, they don't.

Schweitzerian Answer
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John R. Kasich</ENAMEX> stuck around after a meet-and-greet
to help his hostess bury a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX>.

            Backing out of the driveway to go get <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supporters</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> long shot, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Linda Kaiser</ENAMEX> ran over her Shetland
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sheep dog</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Magic</ENAMEX>. Not wanting to delay <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kasich</ENAMEX>'s march to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kaiser put Magic</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">corpse</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">barn</ENAMEX>.

            After the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guests</ENAMEX> had
departed ... well, let <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Linda</ENAMEX> tell it: "I killed my <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> and he buried him. He
said, 'If I ever told my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> I left without burying this <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX>, we'd be
divorced. Get a shovel.' He's human, a nice <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>. He revealed himself as a
real <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>. I can't imagine <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elizabeth Dole</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George W. Bush</ENAMEX> burying my
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX>."

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AG</ENAMEX>
(from under the covers): What I hear you saying is that anyone who talks about
how important it is for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> to stay together and be strong ought to also
be supportive of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> in this situation.
