               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Randy</ENAMEX>'s Wrap-Up
            

            This question generated,
by far, a record number of "similarlies" all focused on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pat Buchanan</ENAMEX>'s
politics. Unavoidable, I suppose. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cartoons</ENAMEX>, sitcoms, and political campaigns
conjure up <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> with a single, instantly recognizable characteristic.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Daffy Duck</ENAMEX> is, well, daffy; Phoebe from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Friends</ENAMEX> is, OK, well she's daffy
too; and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pat Buchanan</ENAMEX> is ... OK, never mind. But to sustain him as a viable
comic foil through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next November</TIMEX>, we'll need to observe him in a more
particular and nuanced way, or pray that he develops webbed feet, like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phoebe</ENAMEX>,
and a quirky sex appeal, like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daffy</ENAMEX>. There's something about that <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">duck</ENAMEX>. I
wonder if he's ever considered joining a new political <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX>.

            
               Is <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">It Hard To Run in</ENAMEX>
Those <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jackboots Answer</ENAMEX>
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jörg Haider</ENAMEX> will be in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday, Nov.</TIMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>, to run in the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">New York City marathon</ENAMEX>. He will be wearing number <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5777</TIMEX>.
Despite protests, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">race officials</ENAMEX> have declined either to eject <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Haider</ENAMEX> or to
reroute the event to keep him out of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Williamsburg</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hasidic</ENAMEX> neighborhood in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brooklyn</ENAMEX>.

            Although it is, of
course, impossible to know how the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> will deal with this potentially
volatile confrontation, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mayor</ENAMEX> has already praised the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> for their
wisdom, restraint, and all around good looks in handling the situation, and
dismissed those who disagree as "publicity-seeking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">idiots</ENAMEX>." Or perhaps he
hasn't.
