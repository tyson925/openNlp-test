            The
cover story concludes, as previously predicted, that the abortifacient <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RU-486</ENAMEX>
will revolutionize the politics of abortion. The pharmaceutical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> that

developing lucrative lifestyle <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> to treat impotence, baldness, wrinkles,

            The
cover story forecasts that within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six years</TIMEX> Latinos will
become the predominant minority in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, due to booming
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immigration</ENAMEX> and birth rates. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanics</ENAMEX> will alter the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, since they are

cover story warns that <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">smallpox</ENAMEX> poses a catastrophic threat to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX>. The highly contagious virus was declared eradicated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1979</TIMEX>, and
