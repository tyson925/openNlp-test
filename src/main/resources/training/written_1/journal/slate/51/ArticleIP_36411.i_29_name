            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">West Side</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beverly Hills</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Calif.</ENAMEX>

            Just when I was planning a somewhat self-pitying
final entry (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Working</ENAMEX> title: "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Next Time, Less Stuckey, More Nookie</ENAMEX>"), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Elizabeth</ENAMEX>
showed me a side of her I hadn't seen before, a warm, affectionate side. Out of
the blue <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">last night</TIMEX>, she asked if we could go out drinking, and--well, let's
say I think I finally broke through to her. It began with a point I made about
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">urban</ENAMEX> sprawl--how when you drive across the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, you realize the issue is
to a large degree phony. There's plenty of space! We should stop worrying! <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">E.</ENAMEX>
seemed to loosen up right away. She even put her hand on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mine</ENAMEX>. I always heard
you could score if you talked policy to her. Not that we had sex. But I will
say I have high expectations for the future. If only the trip had lasted <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one</TIMEX>
more day.

            On the final drive across the desert into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Angeles</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">E.</ENAMEX> seemed as if she had blossomed. Suddenly, after wearing sweatpants
and T-shirts for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five days</TIMEX>, she put on this skimpy little black dress. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Perfume,</ENAMEX>
too. We sped across the desert, the futon on the roof threatening to blow off,
in order to make an appointment she'd made at a ritzy hairdressing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">salon</ENAMEX>. She
said, "I feel so sad this is ending. I'm going to miss you so much." We even
had a road-trip bonding moment. She said she was tired of being an elusive
commitment-phobe, and was ready to start a long-term relationship.

            We pulled <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to 2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Rodeo Drive</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">only five minutes</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">E.</ENAMEX> didn't want me to use the valet, because, as she diplomatically put
it, "with all this stuff, we look like the fucking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clampetts</ENAMEX>." I told her I'd
see her later that <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> to unload her things. She said that "didn't work" for
her, but we arranged to see each other <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX>--"late." I mentioned
again that I'd probably be driving back in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a week or so</TIMEX>, and that it would be
fun if she could come. She smiled. I think she may say yes.
