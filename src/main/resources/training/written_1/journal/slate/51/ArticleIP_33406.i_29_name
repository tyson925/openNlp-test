                  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Editor</ENAMEX>'s note: This week <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate</ENAMEX> introduces
an improved version of "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Fray</ENAMEX>," our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> feedback forum. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fray</ENAMEX> now
features threaded discussions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate</ENAMEX> articles. If you'd like
to discuss something you've read on the site, scroll to the bottom of that
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">article</ENAMEX> and click on "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Post a Message</ENAMEX>." (You can also click on "Comment on This
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Article</ENAMEX>" from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Utilities</ENAMEX> dropdown at the top and bottom of a page.) Or, if
you'd rather just lurk, click on "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Read Messages</ENAMEX>" at the bottom of a page to
find out what everyone else had to say. In the future we'll incorporate the
most insightful postings from <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Fray into</ENAMEX> "E-mail to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Editors</ENAMEX>," and
eventually we'll replace E-mail to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Editors</ENAMEX> with "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Best of the</ENAMEX>

               Why Grades Don't
Matter
            

            While <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven E. Landsburg</ENAMEX>'s "" gives interesting
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">insight</ENAMEX> into the psychology of grade inflation, his economic angle is warped at
best. As someone <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</TIMEX> out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dartmouth College</ENAMEX>, I can tell you that never
have my college grades or those of any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> with whom I've spoken had the
slightest effect on salary. Even those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> of mine who interviewed with
large financial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX> while still in college were never accepted or rejected on
the basis of their grades. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anderson Consulting</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smith Barney</ENAMEX> seem much more
interested in hiring middle-of-the-pack <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">majors</ENAMEX> who happen to have good
interpersonal skills and dedication than math <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whizzes</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.0</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPAs</ENAMEX>.
Interviewing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">talent</ENAMEX> and "well-roundedness" (that bugbear of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">universities</ENAMEX>) make the difference.

            This is not to say that academic achievement isn't
important to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employers</ENAMEX>. But it is ludicrous to suggest, as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Landsburg</ENAMEX> does in
his <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jane</ENAMEX> example, that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employers</ENAMEX> assign tasks and corresponding
salaries based on grades. Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employers</ENAMEX> often do, for better or worse,
give respect to which college an employee graduated from, grades simply do not
enter the picture. Moreover, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> themselves in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">their late 20s</TIMEX>--those who
were in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">graduate</ENAMEX>'s very position <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few years ago</TIMEX>--do most of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interviewing</ENAMEX> and hiring, especially in these larger <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>. Wise to what
really makes a good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX> at that age, they're much more likely to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hem</ENAMEX> and
haw about that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> you spent watching the tube instead of taking a good
internship than they are to have doubts about your D in organic chemistry.

            Even if grades did have
the link to salaries, which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Landsburg</ENAMEX> suggests they do, no <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> with
integrity would let this enter his mind. Speaking of the role of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> in
his book <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">What Is Called Thinking</ENAMEX>? <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin Heidegger</ENAMEX> tells us what any
good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> from kindergarten on up knows: "The real <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> lets nothing else
be learned than learning." No, not knowledge for its own sake, but knowledge
for the sake of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intellectual</ENAMEX>, moral, spiritual, even physical
growth. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX>, or business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> is always more professional for
continuing to pursue these issues outside of his or her profession. This seed
can be sown by good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professors</ENAMEX> regardless of what kind of grades they give. To
follow <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Landsburg</ENAMEX>'s reasoning would not only be to turn <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>'s best
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">universities</ENAMEX> into technical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>, it would be to ignore this fundamental
purpose of higher education.

               Is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pope</ENAMEX> a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heretic</ENAMEX>?
            

            I have just read <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael McGough</ENAMEX>'s "." It seems to
me to really miss the point. The real point is that his papacy dramatically
diverges from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that of the past 1,650 years</TIMEX>, and his theology is anathema to a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">great</ENAMEX> deal of theology that has been considered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catholic</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1,650 years</TIMEX>. It is
this divergence from traditional theology's most basic teachings that offends
traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catholics</ENAMEX> so much. The insistence on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mass</ENAMEX> in the vernacular is by
far the least objectionable to me: It is the new <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mass</ENAMEX> itself that offends
deeply against the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age-old</TIMEX> traditional teachings, not the vernacular languages.
There are many too many divergences to mention here. They range from
theological importance of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> magnitude to common practices that
traditionally supported the theology being taught.

            This <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pope</ENAMEX> often violates what was taught for many
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">centuries</ENAMEX> as holy tradition without any kind of respect for those of us who
lived under the old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>. It was a mortal sin to worship with non-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catholics</ENAMEX>
before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vatican</ENAMEX> II. Mind you, not just something wrong, but something that would
separate you from God and send you to hell if death came before confession.
Now, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pope</ENAMEX> himself attends <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lutheran</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">services</ENAMEX> as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participant</ENAMEX>!
You can see why many of us do not see this as progress!

            If traditionalists
sometimes sound bitter, it should not be something at which to wonder: <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">From</ENAMEX>
being called all sorts of unpleasant names, to overt discrimination, public
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">humiliation</ENAMEX>, and ostracism, traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catholics</ENAMEX> have every reason to distrust
and dislike the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vatican</ENAMEX> II apparatus. And count me among those who do.

"<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blair Witch</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Lessons for Hollywood</ENAMEX>" that says the reason the movie was
so big was because of the word-of-mouth theory and the slow, gradual opening. I
do not deny that this was the perfect way to sell the movie, considering
the scary witch story behind it; however, I think <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Surowiecki</ENAMEX> is missing
the whole point. Please remember what is going on in the movies <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>. I go to
the movies and see a bunch of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX>, guts, and sex. I love black-and-white
movies because back then, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> were required to write a story that had
meaning and hire <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actors</ENAMEX> who could act . The writing was so good
that there was no need to shock the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> with eye-catching filth and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stupidity</ENAMEX>. This movie was good because it was believable and because it was
psychological instead of eye <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">candy</ENAMEX>. Think about that for a change.
