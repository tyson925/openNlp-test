Wrap-Up
            

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> things we know about the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Swiss</ENAMEX>.

            First, they're boring, in a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cheese</ENAMEX> and chocolate
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> that makes the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> a lovely place to massage your money. Everyone
(especially <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brent Curtis</ENAMEX>) knows what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harry Lime</ENAMEX> says in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Third Man :</ENAMEX>
"In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30 years</TIMEX> under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Borgias</ENAMEX> they had warfare, terror, murder, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bloodshed</ENAMEX>, but they produced <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michelangelo</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leonardo da Vinci</ENAMEX>, and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Switzerland</ENAMEX> they had brotherly love--they had 500 years of
democracy and peace, and what did that produce? The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cuckoo</ENAMEX> clock."

            <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, they're a refuge, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Stoppard</ENAMEX>, in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Travesties</ENAMEX> --<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Zurich</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War I</ENAMEX>, home to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lenin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joyce</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tzara</ENAMEX>: "Oh,
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Switzerland</ENAMEX>!--unfurled like a white flag, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pacific</ENAMEX> civilian <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Switzerland</ENAMEX>--the
miraculous neutrality of it, the non-combatant impartiality of it, the
non-aggression pacts of it, the international red cross of it--entente to the
left, d√©tente to the right, into the valley of the invalided blundered and
wandered myself when young--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carr</ENAMEX> of the Consulate!"

            Of course <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carr</ENAMEX> was quite dotty, and neutral does
not mean <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pacific</ENAMEX>, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John McPhee</ENAMEX> makes clear in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">La Place de la Concorde</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Suisse</ENAMEX> , his book on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Swiss</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX>, our <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> bit of alpine lore: Their
armed neutrality includes universal military training. Every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> has a gun,
and none of your sissy <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pistols</ENAMEX>; these are assault <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">rifles</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israeli</ENAMEX>
defense <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> are based on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Swiss</ENAMEX> model, the hedgehog, designed to extract
a high price from any invader--<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">artillery presighted</ENAMEX> on every important <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX>,
shelter space for every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizen</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cow</ENAMEX>, cool <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saab</ENAMEX> fighter <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planes</ENAMEX> whose pilots
train to take off from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">highways</ENAMEX>.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> things--those
red-handled multi-blade ... <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> ... <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> things--the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Swatch</ENAMEX>. And the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">sixth</NUMEX>
thing we know--the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alps</ENAMEX>. Numbered bank accounts would be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX>.

            
               Neutral
Answer
            

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Swiss</ENAMEX> want to make sure <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> coming in are
not abusing the law.
            

            <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">More than 70 percent</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Swiss</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> approved
tougher rules restricting asylum-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">seekers</ENAMEX> and rejected a proposal for maternity
leave, presumably concerned that some incoming <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX> might abuse the law.

            The new law limits <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">refugees</ENAMEX>' rights to appeal
individual persecution, and it speeds up the process of ejecting those without
identity papers.

            Although <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Swiss</ENAMEX> law requires new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> to take an
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eight-week</TIMEX> leave, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Swiss</ENAMEX> have rejected financial assistance for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> four
times since the maternity leave law was enacted in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1945</TIMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Levrat</ENAMEX> works for an
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX> called Aid to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Refugees</ENAMEX>.

Dissent
            

            I beg to differ, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Randy</ENAMEX>!
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the favorite movies of my youth, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tony Randall</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Dreyfus</ENAMEX>
vehicle called <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Sub a Dub Dub</ENAMEX> , a k a Hello Down There , features
the amusing antics of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researcher</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> in their undersea
lab-home. Or perhaps you consider this movie to be evidence for your statement,
not against it? Pshaw!

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matthew Singer</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Savvy Traveler</ENAMEX>
            

            You will recall that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Calvin</ENAMEX>, the granddaddy of fundamentalist <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Protestant</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">preachers</ENAMEX>, founded his
theocracy in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Geneva</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Switzerland</ENAMEX>. This has left more of a mark than you might
expect. A <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">North American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> of mine was driving from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lyon</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Geneva</ENAMEX>. A few
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">miles</ENAMEX> after he crossed the border, his little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> asked, "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dad</ENAMEX>, what happened to
all of the billboards with naked <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ladies</ENAMEX> on them?" It was an acute observation:
The prudish <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Swiss</ENAMEX> countryside did indeed lack for any of the casual skin that
covers <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>.

            
               Misplaced
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Modifiers Extra</ENAMEX>
            

            Which of these
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adjectives</ENAMEX> appear in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> piece describing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George W. Bush</ENAMEX> at
his <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Hampshire</ENAMEX> campaign appearance, and which are from the World
Book <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Encyclopedia</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1960</TIMEX>) article on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">beaver</ENAMEX>?
