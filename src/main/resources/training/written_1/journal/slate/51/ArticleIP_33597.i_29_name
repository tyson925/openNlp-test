            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Quiz participant</ENAMEX> Harald
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amodt</ENAMEX> began his response with the observation, "It's the inclusion of farm
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> that makes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> wonder if this spectacle involves sex or violence." As
dubious as that sentiment might at first appear, a cursory look through his
fellow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>' answers shows that he's quite right: As far as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News Quiz</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> are concerned, those are the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> activities associated with
livestock. (Which, I'm sure, must make this page especially attractive to
prospective 
                  Slate
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">advertisers</ENAMEX>. I'm not sure if this means that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PETA</ENAMEX> ought to spend more on those banner ads, or if it means that they should
save their money. Probably the latter.) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Randy</ENAMEX> may be back a little sooner than

lot, on <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> glance, like "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hannah Arendt</ENAMEX>," who, I'm fairly sure, never
advocated sex with or violence to <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, at least, not in her published
works. And what else did we learn from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Quiz</ENAMEX>? A quick recap. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Canadians:</ENAMEX>

Instead of stabbing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bulls</ENAMEX>, the matadors will tag them with velcro
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">banderillas</ENAMEX> . Or is it the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">banderilleros</ENAMEX> who use the

            With the current furor
over the MPAA ratings system, perhaps it's time we turn to an alternative: the
