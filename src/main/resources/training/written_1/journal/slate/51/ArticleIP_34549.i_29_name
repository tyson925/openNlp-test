            When the larva hit the
omelet pan,
Curling, warping, maybe even
Sizzling a bit, I wanted more
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> to connect my ruined home-
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fries</ENAMEX> to the moths I'd been applauding
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">All summer</TIMEX> into dust. But when
I saw its kin threading up the collar
Of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Colavita Extra Virgin Olive Oil</ENAMEX>,
I scrubbed the cupboards with all
The <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Formula</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">409</NUMEX> to be found, finding
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Larvae</ENAMEX> in the flour, in the corn
Meal last used in the late-eighties,
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">creamy-style Skippy</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Basmati</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX>,
The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sesame seeds</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Aunt Jemima Lite</ENAMEX>.
I swabbed, I purged, I itched
The way I'm itching now to get this right
So you'll scratch too. Do you
Believe your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> merely feels
When it blinks and recoils, figuring
It may have eaten grubs, or do
You think, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Freud</ENAMEX> did, that each
Twitch or catch in the throat
Constitutes a thought? I marvel
How the body we're wired to adore
Disgusts us when we cast it
Out into the world. Spit
Repeatedly into a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">juice glass</ENAMEX>, drink it.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Every day</TIMEX> you drink <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred</NUMEX> times
This half-cup of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">saliva</ENAMEX>. We get
Our lessons in otherness where we can.
How else could I stare into the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">porridge</ENAMEX>
Of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX>'s diarrhea, swallowing
To keep from puking into it, yet grateful
She's still mine enough to let me check?
Or when we add our stink to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stranger</ENAMEX>'s
Stink from the next <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stall</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> stinks
Stink <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than one</NUMEX>, don't they?--and isn't this
How mind and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body mate</ENAMEX> when we're in love?
