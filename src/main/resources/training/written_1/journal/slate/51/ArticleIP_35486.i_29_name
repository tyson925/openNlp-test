            The Borders around the corner, which would never
dream of selling dirty books, is stocking its register display <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</TIMEX> with
another kind of smut: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weather Porn</ENAMEX>. There's Storm of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Century</ENAMEX> ,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isaac</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Storm , The Perfect Storm , When the Wind Blows</ENAMEX> , and
my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">favorite</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Nature on the Rampage</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kamasutra</ENAMEX> for weather nymphos.
Nature on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rampage</ENAMEX> 's cover promises "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hurricanes</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Droughts</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wildfires</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tornadoes</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Floods, Heat Waves, Blizzards</ENAMEX>. Also <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Volcanoes</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Earthquakes</ENAMEX>,
and even <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Comets</ENAMEX>!" ( Even comets! ) Inside are titillating photos--houses
bitten in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> by tornadoes, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> swallowed in snow <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX>, etc.--and details to
arouse even the most jaded weather fetishist. Did you know that several
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> are killed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every year</TIMEX> when lightning strikes a phone pole, courses
through the phone line, and electrocutes them as they are making a call? Tip:
Use a cordless.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mother Nature</ENAMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vanessa del Rio</ENAMEX> of this weather bordello, has never seemed more fascinating
than she seems <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX>'s flood of natural disaster
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">movies-- Volcano , Twister , Asteroid , The Flood</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">etc.</ENAMEX>--ebbed just in time for the real thing: earthquakes in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Turkey</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX>,
a drought on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Coast</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Hurricane Floyd</ENAMEX> and its allied floods. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>
have followed all this obsessively, with weather Web sites reporting record
traffic in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the days</TIMEX> before <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Floyd</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">landfall</ENAMEX>. Is there anyone who can't explain
the Richter scale or distinguish between a Category 4 hurricane and a Category
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>?

            With all this talk of upheaval (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">"Nature's Bedlam</ENAMEX>," as
Nature on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rampage</ENAMEX> likes to call it), you'd think we were suffering a
plague of chaos--record numbers of Category 5 hurricanes, epic tornadoes,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">droughts</ENAMEX>, and the like. It's true that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, with its endless
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">coastline</ENAMEX>, vast climatic variation, massive fault lines, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozens</NUMEX> of active
volcanoes, is exposed to more than its share of Mother Nature's fury. But the
number of natural "events" nationwide and worldwide remains constant. (Some
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">meteorologists</ENAMEX> speculate that we are entering a busy hurricane cycle, but the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jury</ENAMEX> is still out.)

            <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> are more alert
to Mother Nature's rage in part because more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are in its way. According
to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">139 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> live in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">regions</ENAMEX> threatened by hurricanes.
Earthquakes, floods, and volcanoes endanger <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> more. Because property
follows <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, natural disasters have become more destructive: A storm that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rips</ENAMEX> through <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> shreds many more <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> than it would have in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1970</TIMEX>.
According to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Science Foundation</ENAMEX>, natural disasters now cause about
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$100</NUMEX> in damage per <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> per year, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> times as much as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a generation ago</TIMEX>,
even accounting for inflation.

            It's no accident that <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">anxiety</ENAMEX> about nature is surging
during a time of domestic tranquility and (relative) world peace. Weather is a
form of war, God's conflict with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>. Weather is defined by martial
metaphors--"fronts," "clashing" air <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">masses</ENAMEX>, "striking" storms. (<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">War</ENAMEX>, curiously,
is full of meteorological metaphors: a "hail" of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bullets</ENAMEX>, the "fog" of battle.)
Everyone needs an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enemy</ENAMEX>. It's easy to understand why we replace vanishing
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mafiosi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commies</ENAMEX> with asteroids, hurricanes, and volcanoes. Natural disaster
books dominate best-seller lists for the same reason: In an age without great
wars, these are our war narratives.

            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">paranoia</ENAMEX> about the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth Mama</ENAMEX> also owes
something to millenarianism, both religious and environmental. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pat Robertson</ENAMEX>
has blamed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Orlando</ENAMEX>'s nasty weather on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Disney World</ENAMEX>'s hospitality to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gays</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">millennial</ENAMEX> Web pages find biblical significance in every blizzard or
quake. Greeniacs, too, view natural disasters as retribution. Hot Zone
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Preston</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alfred Hitchcock</ENAMEX> of germ terror, has described
murderous jungle viruses this way: "The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX> is mounting an immune response
against the human species. ... Mother Nature is going to get even."

            Gaia <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">theorists</ENAMEX>, who
contend that the planet is a superorganism in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">creatures</ENAMEX> unconsciously
regulate the atmosphere in order to ensure favorable conditions for life, also
believe Mother Nature is on the warpath. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Lovelock</ENAMEX>, who proposed the Gaia
theory, writes that "Gaia ... always keep[s] the world warm and comfortable for
those who obey the rules, but [is] ruthless in her destruction of those who
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transgress</ENAMEX>. Her goal is a planet fit for life. If <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> stand in the way of
this, we shall be eliminated."

            But the most important reason why Mother Nature seems more
powerful <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these days</TIMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX>. The ascendance of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Weather Channel</ENAMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA Today</ENAMEX> weather page, and weather Web sites (click for an earlier

                  Slate
                piece on the weather <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Web</ENAMEX>) have turned weather into national
entertainment. We can (and do) view weather <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">satellite</ENAMEX> photos of any spot on
Earth with a click, hear forecasts <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24/seven</TIMEX>, and watch live footage of weather
disasters on television. There is an endless appetite for weather. It is more
important than sports, more dramatic than the news, and always changing.

            (The media fuel weather
obsession partly because we can now do something about the weather, not
just talk about it. TV <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stations</ENAMEX> send barrages of warnings about storms,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hurricanes</ENAMEX>, tornadoes, floods, blizzards. These warnings undoubtedly save
lives: Natural disasters may cause more property damage in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>,
but they kill fewer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>.)

            The blanket coverage of Mother Nature exacts a price:
weather fatigue. The more she's covered, the less people care about her, and
the more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX> hyperbolize. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">All three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">newsmagazines</ENAMEX> turned their Hurricane
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Floyd</ENAMEX> articles into jeremiads about worsening weather. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> warned of a
future of "supercanes," "hypercanes," and "megastorms" that would make <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Floyd</ENAMEX>
look like a spring shower.

            The final reason for our Mother Nature obsession is
politics. As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jodie T. Allen</ENAMEX> in 
                  Slate
                in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>, a primary function
of any disaster is to funnel <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pork</ENAMEX> to important <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">choppers</ENAMEX> in for commiseration and photo ops. The woebegone <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> congratulate
themselves for their fortitude. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Guard</ENAMEX> is called out to do whatever
it does (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guard</ENAMEX>?). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> busts the budget caps to protect the poor sodden
folk. Then the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">victims bank</ENAMEX> the cash and return to their flood plain or tornado
alley. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Economists</ENAMEX> call this moral hazard. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Politicians</ENAMEX> call it constituent
service. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end</TIMEX>, it seems, Mother Nature is just another welfare <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mom</ENAMEX>,
ruining <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> and taking <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">billions</NUMEX> of tax dollars to do it.
