            When my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ralph Cohen</ENAMEX> announced that his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>
was pregnant, I asked what path he hoped his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> would follow. "It doesn't
matter," said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ralph</ENAMEX>. "If he's happy, I'll be happy." Then, after a thoughtful
pause he added, "My personal preference is <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shortstop</ENAMEX>. But anything he wants to
do is fine with me." Then, after a longer pause: "As long as it's in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">infield</ENAMEX>."

            That's the difference between ordinary altruism,
where you care about other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>'s happiness (though perhaps not as urgently
as you care about your own), and what I'll call "imperfect altruism," where you
reserve the right to care about how others achieve their happiness.

            We all feel altruistic toward our own future
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">selves</ENAMEX>. That's why we make current sacrifices for future rewards. But which
kind of altruists are we? Traditional economic theory says we're the ordinary
kind--we want to be happy in the future, though perhaps not as urgently as we
want to be happy in the present. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Laibson</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> of political
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">economy</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard</ENAMEX>, is one of a few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">iconoclasts</ENAMEX> who disagree. Nobody doubts
that we are imperfectly altruistic toward others. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Laibson</ENAMEX> argues that we can be
imperfectly altruistic toward ourselves. And just as imperfect altruism toward
your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> can cause conflict in your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, imperfect altruism toward your
future self can cause conflict in your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soul</ENAMEX>.

            Here's an example:
Everyone knows that a taste for expensive pleasures can ruin your life. But a
taste for anticipating expensive pleasures can ruin your life in a far
more interesting way. If your greatest joy in life is looking forward to
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX>'s extravagance, you've got a problem: <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tomorrow</TIMEX> is a moving target. On
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX>, you plan a lavish <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX>; when <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> arrives, you indulge
your preference for anticipation by postponing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> till <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX>. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">postponements</ENAMEX> continue until you die and leave a large estate.

            The tragedy here is not that you never get to spend your
money. The tragedy is that you never even get to anticipate spending
your money, because you're smart enough to foresee the whole sequence of events
even before it unfolds. If you love looking forward to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> and if you know
you love looking forward to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX>, then you can never look forward to a
party. Maybe this was what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bertolt Brecht</ENAMEX> meant when he said his life had been
ruined by intelligence.

            The solution, if you can manage it, is to plan a
party that can't be postponed. Pay the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">caterer</ENAMEX> well in advance, and be sure to
choose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> who will penalize you heavily for a last-minute cancellation.

            I suffer from a minor but
aggravating form of this affliction. I avoid reading really good books, because
it robs me of the pleasure of looking forward to them. Of course, knowing this
about myself, I never get to look forward to them either. Air travel has been
my salvation. I force myself to read good books by trapping myself with them on
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">airplanes</ENAMEX>. If they ever upgrade those in-flight <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazines</ENAMEX> into a plausible
reading alternative, I'll be ruined.

            My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ray Heitmann</ENAMEX> suffers from the equal and opposite
problem. Instead of looking forward to extravagance, he likes to anticipate his
own future frugality. He particularly enjoys believing that after a certain
age, he won't spend resources to prolong his own life. But he's painfully aware
that the "certain age" keeps getting redefined so it's always safely in the
future. Therefore, he's looking for ways to limit his own future freedom of
choice.

            If <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ray</ENAMEX> cared only about
his own future happiness (or, to put it another way, if <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ray</ENAMEX> were perfectly
altruistic toward his future self), then you could fairly accuse him of
inconsistency: Limiting your choices can't make you happier. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ray</ENAMEX> cares also
about how he achieves his future happiness, which makes him an imperfect
altruist, but a consistent <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>. If your altruism is imperfect, you can want
your future self to throw a party (or to read a book or to forgo expensive
medical care, or for that matter to save money or to quit smoking), even though
you know your future self would prefer otherwise.

            When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dorothy Parker</ENAMEX> lamented that "I hate writing, but I
love having written," she was expressing the sort of routine tradeoff between
current costs and future benefits that fits right into the traditional economic
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">framework</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Laibson</ENAMEX>'s imperfect <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">altruists</ENAMEX> face a far subtler problem--they're
not just weighing costs and benefits, they're engaged in games of strategy
against their future selves.

            That suggests a new
answer to a question I raised in this space <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few months ago</TIMEX>, namely "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">" My</ENAMEX>
suggestion then was that the lock resolves a conflict between you (who believe
that a hot fudge sundae is worth the calories) and your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mate</ENAMEX>, or potential mate
(who believes otherwise). According to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laibson</ENAMEX>, the conflict is not between you
and your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mate</ENAMEX>, but between you-<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> and you-<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX>. I don't know which
theory is right, but I do know that the door locks remain inexplicable unless
you are in conflict with someone . If all you want for your future self
is happiness and if there's no <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> involved, there can be no good
reason to restrict your future options.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Professors</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Per Krusell</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anthony Smith</ENAMEX> point out that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Laibson</ENAMEX>'s theory makes some surprising predictions about the way <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> save.
Suppose you want to be frugal in the future. If you're a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pessimist</ENAMEX> and don't
trust your future self to be frugal, then you might as well spend all your
money <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> so it doesn't fall into the hands of that future spendthrift. But
if you're an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">optimist</ENAMEX> and expect to practice future self-control, you'll be
inclined to save your money and pass it along into your own future good hands.
Either behavior is self-reinforcing from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one year</TIMEX> to the next. So--contrary to
what we're told by orthodox economic theory--<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> with exactly the
same preferences and exactly the same opportunities can adopt dramatically
different attitudes toward saving.

            If you enjoy contemplating your own future
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">extravagance</ENAMEX> (as opposed to frugality) then Krusell/<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX> reasoning suggests
something even more bizarre: The more you expect to be extravagant in the
future, the more you'll save to finance that future extravagance. But as soon
as you realize you're a "saver," you'll lose confidence in your future
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">extravagance</ENAMEX> and figure you might as well spend your money <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>. At that
point, you realize you're a "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spender</ENAMEX>" and you go back to saving. Your
expectations about the future, and the behavior that stems from them, could
fluctuate wildly.

            Why would human beings have <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Laibson</ENAMEX>-style
preferences in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> place? Here's a wild speculation. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Laibson</ENAMEX>-style
preferences lead to visible attempts at self-control, and visible attempts at
self-control are reassuring to potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mates</ENAMEX>, hence favored by natural
selection. If that speculation stands up to some reasonable tests (say a
computer simulation of resource competition among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> with evolving
preferences), it could tie the two refrigerator-lock theories together into a
single neat package.
