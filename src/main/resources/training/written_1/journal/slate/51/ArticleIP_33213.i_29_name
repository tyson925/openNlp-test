            "The
good lambs
in the yellow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">barn</ENAMEX>--the rest
housed in blue." By

            "the
rest," meaning those who
--the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guide</ENAMEX> explained--inevitably
arrive suffering. "For

            some
do," he added.
Soft.
Serious. This--like

            a new
lesson. As to
some among us, it was,
it seemed. The usual

            
stammer of heart the naive
tend to, in the face of what finally
is only the world. What

            must
it be, to pass
thus--clean, stripped--
through a life? What

            
reluctance the mind
shows on recognizing
that what it approaches

            is, at
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last</TIMEX>, the answer
to the very question it knows
now, but

            too
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late</TIMEX>,
oh better to never to have never
put forward. What I

            mean
is we moved
closer,
in,

            to the
blue <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">barn</ENAMEX>'s
advertisement--
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">flaw,</ENAMEX>

            
weakness. We
looked in.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Three days</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four days</TIMEX>

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">old</ENAMEX>.
Few expected to
finish <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the evening</TIMEX> it was beginning to
be already. And the small

            crowd
of us
shifting forward, and--
in our shifting uniformly--it

            being
possible to see how between
us and any
field rendered by a sudden wind

            single
gesture--kowtow,
upheaval--there was
little difference. Some

            took
photographs; most
did a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stranger</ENAMEX> thing: touched
briefly, without

            
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">distinction</ENAMEX>, whichever
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> stood immediately in
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">front of</ENAMEX>, next to. Less

            for
support than
as remedy or proof or
maybe--given the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lambs</ENAMEX> who

            
besides dying, were as well
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">filthy</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">waste</ENAMEX> and, negotiating

            the
dwindling contract
between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">flies</ENAMEX> everywhere)--

            maybe
the touching
concerned curbing the hand's instinct
to follow the eye, to

            confirm vision. Who
can
say? I was there--yes--but
I myself touched no one.
