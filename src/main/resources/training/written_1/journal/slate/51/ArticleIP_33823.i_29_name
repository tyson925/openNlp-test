            A
socio-political aftershock rumbles through <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Turkey</ENAMEX>. The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Aug. 17</TIMEX> earthquake "sent
tremors rippling through <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Turkey</ENAMEX>'s political and social world, triggering a
backlash against the traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> faith in an all-powerful <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>,"
reported <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toronto</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Globe and Mail</ENAMEX> . Although it is unlikely that the current
government will be brought down by the crisis, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> says it could lead to
"the grassroots development of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Turkey</ENAMEX>'s fragile democracy. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">volunteers</ENAMEX> who poured into the earthquake zone will not easily forget the power
they were able to mobilize."

            
Writing in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Herald Tribune</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mehmet Ali Birand</ENAMEX> called
for "massive economic-political support, reminiscent of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Marshall Plan</ENAMEX>."
Referring to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Turkey</ENAMEX>'s longstanding application for membership in the European
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Union, Birand</ENAMEX> said, "A special <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">fund</ENAMEX> needs to be established to get the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX>
economy up and running, not under the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> but this
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">campaign</ENAMEX> led by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX>. It is urgent that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Union</ENAMEX>
formally grant <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Turkey</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> status."

            
Meanwhile, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Independent</ENAMEX> reported that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKK Kurdish</ENAMEX> separatist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> has started to
withdraw its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Turkey</ENAMEX> into northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a week earlier</TIMEX> than
previously announced. A statement issued by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> declared, "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">To</ENAMEX>
unilaterally stop the war at this time of heavy disaster is the greatest
support to the state and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Turkey</ENAMEX>," since money spent fighting the PKK
should instead go to earthquake-recovery efforts.

            After
25 years of comparative neglect, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East Timor</ENAMEX> has found its way into the world's
papers <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</TIMEX> (see <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX>'s ). Writing in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Globe and Mail</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marcus</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gee</ENAMEX> said that of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> options in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Aug. 30</TIMEX> referendum--autonomy within
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indonesia</ENAMEX> or independence--the most likely outcome might not be the best.
"Becoming independent may end their oppression; it will not end their troubles.
In fact, it may only make those troubles worse." He added, "The independent
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nation of East Timor</ENAMEX> would be a flyspeck on the world map." Without <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indonesian</ENAMEX>
subsidies <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East Timor</ENAMEX> would be at the mercy of the international aid community
and susceptible to civil strife.

            
Another referendum is scheduled to take place <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sept. 16</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Algeria</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX>
are being asked to approve or reject a presidential reconciliation effort that
offers amnesty to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> convicted of actively supporting violence as long as
they did not actually commit acts of violence. To enhance <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Algeria</ENAMEX>'s chances of
peace, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Dawn</ENAMEX> said in an editorial
that the recent upsurge of political violence--<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 130</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have been
killed by armed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">extremists</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent weeks</TIMEX>--must "not be allowed to weaken or
derail" the peace efforts. At the same time, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> said, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Algerian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abdelaziz Bouteflika</ENAMEX> "must concentrate his efforts on removing one of the
primary causes of popular discontent and strife, namely, economic mismanagement
which has led to a high unemployment rate and declining living standards."

            The
kidnapping of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> mining <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineers</ENAMEX> in the central <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kyrgyzstan</ENAMEX> has caused a crisis in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>. According to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asahi</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shimbun</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hostage takers</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Islamic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rebels</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tajikistan</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mainichi Shimbun</ENAMEX> speculated that jealousy might have been a
motive for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> within <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tajikistan</ENAMEX> or other neighboring <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> envious of
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>'s generous aid program to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kyrgyzstan</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commentator</ENAMEX> suggested that "the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">culprits</ENAMEX> may well have deliberately targeted the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> knowing that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>
places top priority on human lives in settling [<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hostage</ENAMEX>] cases. ... Taking
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hostages</ENAMEX> could be aimed at getting a ransom as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX>, water and
food." Another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pundit</ENAMEX> questioned the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> aid <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s decision to declare
the area safe. Lax security has been blamed for other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hostage</ENAMEX>-taking incidents
involving <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nationals</ENAMEX>, such as the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four-month</TIMEX> seizure of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japanese</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Embassy</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lima</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Peru</ENAMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>, and this may have led to a perception of
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> as easy targets, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asahi Shimbun</ENAMEX> said.

            The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hindu of</ENAMEX>
Madras reports that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>'s hottest Web site is <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">soniagandhionline</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">com</ENAMEX>. Normally thought of as reclusive, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress Party</ENAMEX> is now accessible "with a vengeance." Stung by
accusations that it has fallen behind in the online competition, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>' main
political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rival</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BJP</ENAMEX>, said that it prefers a chat format for online
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">discourse</ENAMEX> and will have a site up and running soon.
