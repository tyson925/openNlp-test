               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Randy</ENAMEX>'s
Wrap-Up
            

            The problem with parades is the wrong thing
moves--the entertainment, not the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX>. That's why the piano is used so
seldom in parade music, and it's why we're a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> of fatties--all that
standing around waiting for some baton twirler to arrive. When the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vatican</ENAMEX>
finally brought the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Piet√†</ENAMEX> over to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, they didn't put
it on a float and trundle it down <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Main Street</ENAMEX>; they displayed it in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">reverential hush of the World's Fair</ENAMEX>. The statue sat; the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> moved,
gliding past it on conveyor belts the way <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michelangelo</ENAMEX> intended.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Macy's Thanksgiving Parade</ENAMEX>--and isn't a holiday
so much more festive when it has a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sponsor</ENAMEX>?--does both. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thanksgiving Eve</TIMEX>,
crowds stroll past the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">balloons</ENAMEX> while they're being inflated. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">The next morning</TIMEX>,
there's a traditional parade, with Huge <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pneumatic Licensed Characters</ENAMEX> dragged
past cold, immobile <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spectators</ENAMEX>, lined up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>-deep at the curb, unable to see
much beyond the frost-covered <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> in front of them, and the
occasional chunk of plummeting debris.

            So <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</TIMEX>, let's
switch from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gay Pride Parade</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Gay Pride Street Fair</ENAMEX>--good exercise, a
cultural celebration, and a chance to buy inexpensive socks. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Viva</ENAMEX>!

            "He's just not popular ."

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mayor</ENAMEX> himself sees the jeers not as political
protest but as psychological distress. "You should be able to march as the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mayor</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York City</ENAMEX> anyplace you want, and if <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> can't deal with their
own anger over that, that's really something emerging from inside them," he
said. "And the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boston Tea Party</ENAMEX>? Some kind of oedipal thing," he did not
add.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mayor</ENAMEX>'s surprise at being booed was not
entirely disingenuous. His policies toward the gay <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> have been
sufficiently benign to cost him some right-wing support in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> race.
Anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giuliani</ENAMEX> sentiment was particularly vigorous among <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanic</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African-American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gays</ENAMEX>. "Couldn't they be forced into some separate Minority <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gay</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Pride Parade?</ENAMEX>" he did not ask.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gay</ENAMEX> and straight New
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Yorkers</ENAMEX> can now come together to boo the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mayor</ENAMEX> following <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX>'s
announcement of yet another giveaway to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Warner</ENAMEX>--this time a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$28 million</NUMEX>
subsidy to the publishing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giuliani</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> has dispensed
more than <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2 billion</NUMEX> in tax breaks and electrical subsidies to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> large
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporations</ENAMEX>, squandering public money and shifting the tax burden to smaller
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>.
