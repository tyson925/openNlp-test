Wrap-Up
            

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> mock the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> mock the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Serbs</ENAMEX> kill the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Albanians</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Albanians</ENAMEX> kill the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Serbs</ENAMEX>--ah, that
crazy regional humor. But our <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-Southern</ENAMEX> jabs, above, are more than the
ordinary scorn of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX> vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX>, more than urban vs. rural. Most of our
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">jibes</ENAMEX> work a rich vein of educated vs. uneducated, which is another way of
saying rich vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poor</ENAMEX>. It's class warfare played out as a barnyard bestiality
joke. What those dumb hicks really lack is the wherewithal for a fine
university education that will lead to a job in the go-go tech sector.

            There is one detail of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern</ENAMEX> japes that has inverted its class <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Several centuries ago</TIMEX>,
incestuous liaisons were for the aristocracy, now they're farmyard fun. In the
former case, incest was a symptom of decadence, in the latter it's just rural
isolation and the lack of dating opportunities. Them <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX> don't need loftier
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">morals</ENAMEX>, they need a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Starbucks</ENAMEX>.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern Fried</ENAMEX>
Answer
            

            "You <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> down there in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alabama</ENAMEX> can go ahead and
pray over the intercom all you want."

            An opinion from a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-judge <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> from the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">11 th</ENAMEX> circuit allows <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> to conduct organized prayers in school
as long as they don't actively proselytize, and as long as school personnel
have no direct role.

            School <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> said one change will be that
pre-game prayers will now be conducted without the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coach</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chandler</ENAMEX> called the
decision, allowing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> to use state <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> to foster religion,
"hideously unprincipled." The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACLU</ENAMEX> is expected to appeal.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sean Fitzpatrick</ENAMEX>'s
Ichthys Follow-Up
            

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catholic</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Encyclopedia</ENAMEX> says:

            
               Among the symbols employed by the primitive <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christians</ENAMEX>, that of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> ranks probably <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> in importance. Its popularity was due principally to
the famous acrostic consisting of the initial letters of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> words
forming the word for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ichthys</ENAMEX>), which briefly but clearly described the
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">character of Christ and His</ENAMEX> claim to the worship of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">believers</ENAMEX>: Iesous Christos
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Theou Yios Soter</ENAMEX>, i.e. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus Christ</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Son of God</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saviour</ENAMEX>.
            

            You've probably seen the
bumper stickers of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish symbol inscribed</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> letters <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IX</NUMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TH</ENAMEX>)<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YS</ENAMEX> (iota
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">chi</ENAMEX> theta upsilon sigma). Lately there have been stickers in which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> has
sprouted feet and eyes and is inscribed "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Darwin</ENAMEX>." <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A couple of months ago</TIMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Atlanta</ENAMEX> I saw the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Darwinian</ENAMEX> whatever being swallowed by a larger <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inscribed</ENAMEX> "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TRUTH</ENAMEX>." And the beat goes on.

            
               Domain Name
Availability Extra
            

            Many a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> about to launch its Web site
discovers to its dismay that its name is already taken, part of the speculative
frenzy in domain names. In that case, they can either buy the name from its
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owner</ENAMEX> or, with ingenuity, devise an alternative.
