               The 
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX> agreed to an independent inquiry
into the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Waco</ENAMEX> incident. After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six years</TIMEX> of denials, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> confessed it
had fired incendiary tear gas devices at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Branch Davidian</ENAMEX> compound. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>
still says it's unlikely that these devices caused the fire. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Attorney General</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Janet Reno</ENAMEX> ordered federal marshals to seize videotapes from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> headquarters
on which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> reportedly can be heard discussing the use of these devices.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> suggested <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reno</ENAMEX>'s actions would damage an already

               Violence 
               broke out in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East Timor</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Pacific</ENAMEX>
territory voted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</TIMEX> on independence from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indonesia</ENAMEX>. Results are expected

                  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX>
                criticized <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indonesia</ENAMEX>, which is
still responsible for maintaining peace on the island, for failing to respond
to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">militias</ENAMEX>. The New
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">York Times</ENAMEX> warned that international intervention might become
necessary.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">league</ENAMEX>. When the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">league</ENAMEX> accepted their resignations, they sued to block their
removal. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">union</ENAMEX> accepted their removal in a settlement but claimed victory
because <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">league</ENAMEX> agreed to let an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">arbitrator</ENAMEX> decide whether to reinstate
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">umpires</ENAMEX>; and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) in any event, they'll be paid for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the rest of the season</TIMEX>.
Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">umpires</ENAMEX> disagreed, saying they'd rather be working .

The cryptic announcement by the toys' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX> sent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">collectors</ENAMEX> rushing to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX>. The anxious take: The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX>'s notorious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">quirkiness</ENAMEX> lends
credibility to the announcement. The cynical take: It's a
marketing ploy to jump-start demand. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Collectors</ENAMEX> warned

countered that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only three</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> initial suspects in the case were of
