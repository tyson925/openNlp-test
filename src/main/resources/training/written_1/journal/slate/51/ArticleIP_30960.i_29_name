Wrap-Up
            

            "<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Deranged</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">militias</ENAMEX>,
abandoned <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factories</ENAMEX>, and seething hostility to the poor, that is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Michigan</ENAMEX> to
me." So concludes the winning essay in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> ... No , wait, sorry.
That is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Michigan</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News Quiz</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>. But to the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1960</TIMEX> edition of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Book Encyclopedia</ENAMEX> , it is so much more. It is the wolverine <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>,
"although <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> believe there were never many wolverines there," notes a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cranky Willis Dunbar</ENAMEX>, author of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Book</ENAMEX> essay. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Michigan</ENAMEX> is also
celebrated as the "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Water Wonderland</ENAMEX>," because it has "<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> times as much
water-covered area as any <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>," a curious boast, giving the impression that
by the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> paragraph, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dunbar</ENAMEX> is straining to find nice things to say.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Michigan</ENAMEX>--surprisingly submerged! Indeed, being excessively water-covered is
what sends most <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> whining to the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> for emergency aid.
Still, it makes a nice license plate slogan--<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Michigan</ENAMEX>: more water-covered than
any of you bastards!--and it probably keeps down the wolverine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>.

            Owning a home strengthens, stabilizes, builds,

<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kosovo</ENAMEX> and ourselves to notice.

            As one of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the month</TIMEX>'s many activities, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Michigan</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Housing Development Authority</ENAMEX> sponsored an essay and drawing contest,

purchased a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX> through a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSHDA</ENAMEX> funding and loan program. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Michigan</ENAMEX>

contributed to the festive mood of the event.
