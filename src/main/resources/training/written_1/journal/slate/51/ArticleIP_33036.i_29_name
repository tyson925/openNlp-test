                  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mystery Men</ENAMEX>
                (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Universal Pictures</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> get a
few chuckles out of this comic book-based tale of B-team superheroes (the
Shoveler, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Furious</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bowler</ENAMEX>), but nobody guffaws outright. The most
enthusiastic: It "triumphs by being its smart, shambling self, though it takes
a while to get there" (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Corliss</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> ). Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> say the
tasty nuggets of fun are too few and far between: It "has moments of brilliance
waving their <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX> to attract attention in a sea of dreck" (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger Ebert</ENAMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicago Sun-Times</ENAMEX> ). (To check out the comic book the film was based on
and to watch the trailer, visit the official site.)

            

               
                  The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Thomas Crown Affair</ENAMEX>
                (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer</ENAMEX>). This
"slick, gaudily suave guilty pleasure of a movie" (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Ansen</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek</ENAMEX> ) gets mainly good reviews. In its favor: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) It's the first
movie in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a long time</TIMEX> to have a sexy and mature female <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lead</ENAMEX>, the 45-year-old
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rene Russo</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) It's the first decent movie of the summer not aimed at <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teens</ENAMEX>, a
"highly pleasurable popcorn movie for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>" (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Susan Wloszczyna</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> ). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) Its extravagance is fun (the story centers on a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">billionaire</ENAMEX> who
steals art for kicks). Not all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> are entranced by this remake of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1968</TIMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve McQueen-Faye Dunaway</ENAMEX> film. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe Morgenstern</ENAMEX> of the Wall Street
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal</ENAMEX> writes that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Russo</ENAMEX> and co-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">star</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce Brosnan</ENAMEX>'s sex scenes "spark so
little heat I found myself wondering if they'd give a damn for one another in a
down market." The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Janet Maslin</ENAMEX> concurs, calling the
romance "papier-mache." Side note: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ebert</ENAMEX> uses the bizarre sexual euphemism
"rumpy-pumpy" for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">sixth</NUMEX> time in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eight months</TIMEX> in his negative review in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicago Sun-Times</ENAMEX> . (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Click</ENAMEX> here to watch the trailer.)

            

               
                  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dick</ENAMEX>
                (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony Pictures Entertainment</ENAMEX>). Everybody loves
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dick</ENAMEX> , "a gaily funny, shrewdly inventive satire" (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lisa Schwarzbaum</ENAMEX>,
Entertainment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Weekly</ENAMEX> ) of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Watergate</ENAMEX> scandal told from the point of
view of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> teen-age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX>. Much of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cast</ENAMEX> is plucked from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TV</ENAMEX> comedy shows
such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Kids</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hall</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Saturday Night Live</ENAMEX> , so the humor
tends toward the broad and low. 
                  Slate
               's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Edelstein</ENAMEX> is
enchanted not just by the humor but also by the straight history: "Under its
slapstick shenanigans, this modest movie offers a convincing vision of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nixon</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> as a sordid buffoon show undone by a couple of painfully
earnest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">innocents</ENAMEX>." A handful of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> complain that the "nincompoopery is
difficult to sustain over the course of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an hour and a half</TIMEX>" (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michael</ENAMEX>
O'Sullivan, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> ). (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Click</ENAMEX> to read the rest of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edelstein</ENAMEX>'s

                (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buena Vista Pictures</ENAMEX>). Excellent notices
all around for this "psychological thriller that actually thrills" about a "sad
little hamster of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX>" (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schwarzbaum, Entertainment Weekly</ENAMEX> ) who sees
visions of dead <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">psychologist</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce Willis</ENAMEX> cast against type)
determined to help him. It is "virtually guaranteed to rattle the most jaded of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cages</ENAMEX>" (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Anderson</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los Angeles Times</ENAMEX> ). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cage</ENAMEX> is left
unrattled, though: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Holden</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> delivers an
uncharacteristically nasty write-up, calling it "gaggingly mawkish supernatural
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kitsch</ENAMEX>" that is "a garish hybrid of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simon Birch</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">What Dreams</ENAMEX> May
Come ." (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Click</ENAMEX> here to visit the official site.)

                  The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Autobiography</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Stalin</ENAMEX>
               , by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Lourie</ENAMEX>
(<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Counterpoint Press</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Critics</ENAMEX> find this novel, told from the point of view of
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX>'s most famous and ruthless <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dictator</ENAMEX>, a fascinating, chilling, and
surprisingly humor-filled work: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lourie</ENAMEX>'s "flat, ruthless prose ... is also
sometimes ruthlessly funny" (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lance Morrow</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> ). Some wonder at the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>'s desire to explore the mind of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who murdered so many, but most are
impressed with his results. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> fault, though, is that "this supposed
autobiography is missing what often makes an autobiography great: the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">memoirist</ENAMEX>'s obvious self-deception"(<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ken Kalfus</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times Book</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Review</ENAMEX> ). (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Click</ENAMEX> here to read the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> chapter.)

               , by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Basement Jaxx</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Astralwerks</ENAMEX>). Reviewers get
giddy over this <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">electronica duo</ENAMEX>'s latest: "more fun than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fatboy Slim</ENAMEX>,
more creative than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chemical Brothers</ENAMEX> ... takes house music to the next
level. Make that the level after next" (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rob Brunner</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Entertainment</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Weekly</TIMEX> ). It's blessed with "post-cool happiness" (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Hunter</ENAMEX>, the
Village <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Voice</ENAMEX> ), which makes it "an antidote for ennui, using hedonistic,
ass-wiggling enthusiasm and 'ain't-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">no</NUMEX>-mountain-high-enough' lyrical
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">proclamations" (M. Tye Comer</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMJ</ENAMEX> ). (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Click</ENAMEX> here to buy the CD and to listen to audio samples from the

Blues
               ,by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joyce Carol Oates</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dutton</ENAMEX>). Good reviews for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oates</ENAMEX>'
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">29 th</NUMEX> novel, which follows the way a small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> remembers its
teen-age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hero</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">John Reddy Heart</ENAMEX>. It "dramatizes how wanting and memory compete"
and explores how "lonely, unhappy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> mythologize their adolescence" (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">D.T.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Max</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times Book Review</ENAMEX> ). Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> marvel at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oates</ENAMEX>'
prolific output: "It's a wonder she hasn't run out of that all-too-scarce
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">literary fuel</ENAMEX>, imagination. But she hasn't" (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Linda Wolfe</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> ).
