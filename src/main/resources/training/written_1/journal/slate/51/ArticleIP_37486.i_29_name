            He
drank from a bottle and waded in the river.
He waded near the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX> and watched the light
Drain through the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> and set on the water
That told his fortune with floating sticks and leaves.
He saw his place arranged there before him,
A dinner service set on a table of glass
That he, the thrown rock of himself, might break,
His own reflection, the gray shadow of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>,
Its murky back twisting through stumps and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">weeds</ENAMEX>.

            Then
he heard her step through the forest, the sound
Of the steps preceding her through the leaves
Like the calling card of a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">doe</ENAMEX> approaching the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>,
Trying her footing across newly covered ground.
Backpacker, he thought, and put away his bottle,
Not wanting it a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stranger</ENAMEX>'s first sight of him,
Cheered it might be someone who liked a line of chatter,
He, not having spoken to anything but a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worm</ENAMEX>
All day in the forest instead of at work.

            He had been changing a
flat, a roofing nail
Pried from the tread with the edge of a dime,
Rolling the spare when he first heard the river
On the other side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> when his breathing slowed.
Having heard it, he wanted to see it at once,
To wade in his boots and drag a cast line
In the flat current moving toward him,
When she stepped into the clearing above the river,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yellow</ENAMEX> leaves on her arms and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> in her hair.
