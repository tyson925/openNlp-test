                (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DreamWorks SKG</ENAMEX>). Raves
for this dystopian dark-side-of-the-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX>-dream tale starring <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kevin Spacey</ENAMEX>
as a "suburban <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Travis Bickle</ENAMEX>--off his rocker, but happy about it" (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Owen</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gleiberman, Entertainment Weekly</ENAMEX> ), who experiences a massive midlife
crisis and falls in lust with his teen-age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spacey</ENAMEX> acts with
"heavenly finesse" (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Janet Maslin</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> ), and Annette
Bening as his high-strung <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> is "spectacular" (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike Clark</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA Today</ENAMEX> ).
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam Mendes</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Ball</ENAMEX>, are new to film--they're stage
and television <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">veterans</ENAMEX>, respectively--and many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> say that's why the film
feels so fresh. A handful of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> concede that while the film is technically
excellent, it's in no way groundbreaking; rather it's simply a collection of
"stale and reactionary ideas" being pawned off "under the all-purpose rubric of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'black</ENAMEX> comedy' " (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Edelstein</ENAMEX>, 
                  Slate
               ). (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Click</ENAMEX> to read the

                  Love of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Game</ENAMEX>
                (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Universal</ENAMEX>
Pictures). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kevin Costner</ENAMEX> heads back to the buffet for a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> helping of
<ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">baseball</ENAMEX>, this time as an aging <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pitcher</ENAMEX> in the last game of his career.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Costner</ENAMEX>'s performance may be decent, but most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> call this effort out at
the plate. Cutting back and forth between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Costner</ENAMEX> as he pitches a perfect game
and remembers his longtime <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girlfriend</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam</ENAMEX> "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Evil Dead</ENAMEX> "
Raimi nails <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the baseball half</TIMEX> of the film, but the romance is so awful that
"you will simply want to shoot yourself by the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> inning" (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Corliss</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> ). (Take a look at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kevin Costner</ENAMEX>'s high-school yearbook page

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vonnegut</ENAMEX>'s beloved novel, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> agree that the result is a "frenzied film
that seems both dated and dead on arrival" (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Travers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rolling</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stone</ENAMEX> ). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Holden</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> writes that it "looks
and feels like a frantic live-action psychedelic cartoon ... a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Waters</ENAMEX> film
divested of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camp</ENAMEX>." <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce Willis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stars</ENAMEX> as a car <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">salesman</ENAMEX> who experiences a
crisis of conscience; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nick Nolte</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barbara Hershey</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albert Finney</ENAMEX> round out
the rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cast</ENAMEX>. What went wrong? Skewering consumer culture might have been
novel in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1970s</TIMEX>, but <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these days</TIMEX> it feels like beating a dead horse. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Click</ENAMEX>

                (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fox; Thursdays</ENAMEX>; <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:30 p.m. ET</TIMEX>). Excellent
reports for this profanity-laced comedy about a nasty <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX> movie <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">producer</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> are unanimous that it's "<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the season</TIMEX>'s naughtiest, bawdiest, and
probably funniest new show" (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Shales</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> ). Just
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about every</TIMEX> review describes it as "edgy." Not only is it full of cursing,
ethnic jokes, prostitution, and the like, but it dares to have no laugh track
and a bastard as the protagonist: "the show is truly subversive and daring in
its scabrous attitude" (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caryn James</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> ). A few minor
complaints: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) The show is "a little in love with its own transgressiveness"
(<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Poniewozik</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> ). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) The show relies on "humiliation humor" and
Entertainment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Weekly</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ken Tucker</ENAMEX> predicts that the unlikability of star
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jay Mohr</ENAMEX> will sink the show. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Click</ENAMEX> here to find

                  A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Memoir</ENAMEX>
               , by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank McCourt</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Simon</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">& Schuster</ENAMEX>). The expectations for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McCourt</ENAMEX>'s follow-up to the best-selling
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Angela</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Ashes</ENAMEX> were high, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> are uniformly disappointed: It
"lacks the drama, the magic, the gentleness, the lilt of the first book"
(<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Deirdre Donahue</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA Today</ENAMEX> ). They're quick to point out that
'Tis , which picks up <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McCourt</ENAMEX>'s life at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 19</TIMEX>, once he has left <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ireland</ENAMEX>
for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>, is not a bad book, it's just not as good as the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>. McCourt
"seems less in control in this book and at times is powerless to keep himself
from becoming the stage <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Irishman</ENAMEX>, crying in his <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beer</ENAMEX>, milking sentiment until
it becomes false" (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Collier</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los Angeles Times</ENAMEX> ). (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Click</ENAMEX>

Destiny
               , by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pat Buchanan</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Regnery Publishing</ENAMEX>). The anticipated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reform</ENAMEX>
Party presidential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> gets harsh reviews from conservative
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">publications</ENAMEX>--and no reviews from liberal ones. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buchanan</ENAMEX> may be a compelling
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX>, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> attack his isolationist policies and revisionist history
(highlight: <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> would not have invaded <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> had <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">America</ENAMEX> stayed out of
<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrew Roberts</ENAMEX> writes in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buchanan</ENAMEX>'s thesis is "deeply flawed" and "does not stand up to close historical
scrutiny." <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert G. Kaufman</ENAMEX>, in a long review in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Weekly Standard</ENAMEX>
(which welcomes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buchanan</ENAMEX>'s departure from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Republican Party</ENAMEX>), paints
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buchanan</ENAMEX> as having gone over to the dark side: He's "a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of
the perpetual temptations of conservative thought." In regards to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buchanan</ENAMEX>'s
support of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Lindbergh</ENAMEX>'s isolationist anti-war campaigning, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kaufman</ENAMEX>
writes, "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buchanan</ENAMEX>'s defense of the morally and strategically indefensible is
remarkable." (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Click</ENAMEX> here to visit <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buchanan</ENAMEX>'s campaign <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX>.)
