               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Randy</ENAMEX>'s Wrap-Up
            

            In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News Quiz</ENAMEX> responses
and in the wider culture (if there is one), <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> is used as a metaphor for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ideology</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bread</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">roses</ENAMEX>; let them eat <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cake</ENAMEX>) and for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX>: Their
attitudes toward eating reveal something, well, distasteful about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">President</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calista Flockhart</ENAMEX>. It is also a metaphor for sex and never more
delightfully so than in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fowl</ENAMEX>-eating scene in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tony Richardson</ENAMEX>'s movie of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Jones</ENAMEX> . There is, however, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> place I can think of where the
equation is reversed so that sex is a metaphor for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tampopo</ENAMEX> ,
when the incredibly attractive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> in white are not actually in a gourmet
frenzy, sex is simply food carried on by other means. And it really makes you
hungry. If that's the appetite I mean.

Answer
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Doolittle</ENAMEX> is listing the free eats Majority
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Whip</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom DeLay</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>, serves up at his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> to fellow <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> during
late-night sessions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX>, just one of the ways he has become, according
to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marshall Whitmann</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heritage Foundation</ENAMEX>, "the most powerful majority
whip in the history of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX>."

            And he's handing out more than ribs. The basis of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DeLay</ENAMEX>'s power is ladling out cash to those who please him. The chief
fund-raiser for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Republican Congressional Committee</ENAMEX>, he raises more
than half the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>'s money. And those who supply the funds are not neglected
either. As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alison Mitchell</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marc Lacey</ENAMEX> report in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> ,
"<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DeLay</ENAMEX> has long had a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen</ENAMEX> cabinet of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lobbyists</ENAMEX> who meet with him
regularly."

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DeLay</ENAMEX> is now launching a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$25 million</NUMEX> fund-raising
campaign to fight trade <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unions</ENAMEX> through the innovative method of establishing a
nonprofit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporation</ENAMEX> that can raise unlimited cash without disclosing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX>,
a plan his fellow <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">congressman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chris Shays</ENAMEX> calls, "unbelievably
sick."

            In a rare case of
bipartisan agreement, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Obey</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wash.</ENAMEX>, notes, "To me, the worst thing in
politics is anonymous, under-the-bedclothes money," he said. "Along with some
of the things I've seen in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> shower <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>," he did not add.

            I guess we've all had one drink too many and
embarrassed ourselves at a funeral. Or borrowed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> funds that we had every
intention of returning, so there was really no reason to call the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX>. But
would you know how to treat the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">corpse</ENAMEX> at someone else's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">synagogue</ENAMEX>, or

               The Behavior
            

            

               Join the line of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewers</ENAMEX> and view the body silently and somberly. ( No
cutting ahead saying, "I just have this quart of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk</ENAMEX>.")
               

               Look reverently upon the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> and do not touch it. ( Especially not with
cooking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">utensils</ENAMEX>.)
               

               A moment of silent prayer. ( During which you can think about where to go
for lunch. Like he'd mind. He's dead.)
               

               Look upon it somberly for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a few moments</TIMEX>. ( Then look upon him with a big
goofy grin on your face and sing him a medley of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cole Porter</ENAMEX> tunes. He would
have wanted it that way.)
               

               Stand quietly and then move on. (Pretty much the way the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mayor</ENAMEX> orders
all <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">New Yorkers</ENAMEX> to behave in every situation.)
               

               A kiss is appropriate, but no tongue unless you were close before death.
OK, I just made that one up. But wouldn't that make the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">funeral</ENAMEX> weirdly
exciting?

               This is optional, but if it is a memorial service, there will be no <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> to
view. ( With their excellent system of national health, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadians</ENAMEX> never
die.)
