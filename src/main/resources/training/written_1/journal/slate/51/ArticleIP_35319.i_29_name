"Nihilism"? Try Tragedy.

            The heart of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edelstein</ENAMEX>'s
negative assessment (and "rank" seems to be a negative word indeed to summarize
a movie that draws a great deal of praise in the course of the review) seems to
be his assertion that "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">American Beauty</ENAMEX>" is:

            
               ... [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX>]aying
that our only hope is to cultivate a kind of stoned aesthetic detachment
whereby even a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> with his brains blown out becomes an object of beauty and a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signpost</ENAMEX> to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Higher Power</ENAMEX>. But to scrutinize a freshly dead <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> and not ask
how it got that way--or if there's anyone nearby with a gun who might want to
add to the body count--strikes me as either moronic or insane or both. The kind
of detachment the movie is peddling isn't artistic, it isn't life--it's
nihilism at its most fatuous. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> Beauty is New Age
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nihilism</ENAMEX>.
            

            I suggest that Mr.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edelstein</ENAMEX> take a closer look at the end of the movie. He might notice that ONLY
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ricky Fitts</ENAMEX>, a seriously damaged <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX>, is shown regarding the body with
aesthetic detachment. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> is frozen in fear when she enters the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>;
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lester</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>, who also apparently sees the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>, is consumed with horror and
revulsion at her own murderous intentions. Other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> are only shown
reacting to the sound of the gunshot. Nor does the film suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lester</ENAMEX>
shares <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ricky</ENAMEX>'s world view. The montage of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lester</ENAMEX>'s memories at the end of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">film</ENAMEX> is hardly nihilistic: He remembers the closest relationships in his past
life with wonder and gratitude. At the moment of his death he is looking
lovingly at a photograph of his former self and his young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, not at a
plastic bag whirling in the wind.

            In short, I see no evidence that the filmmakers
wanted to endorse <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ricky</ENAMEX>'s nihilistic detachment. As a matter of fact, his eerie
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">self-possession</ENAMEX> is depicted as a tragic dislocation from life itself, a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pitiable</ENAMEX> response to his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>'s brutality. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edelstein</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critic</ENAMEX> of unusual
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sensitivity</ENAMEX> and sophistication, simply fails to realize that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">makers</ENAMEX> of
"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">American Beauty</ENAMEX>" show an appreciation of moral and ethical complexity that
equals his own.

            I hope he will
reconsider his harsh conclusion.

            There is a huge difference between a fast-moving
experimental science and a more theoretical field. In molecular biology, which
I know best, the editorial process is nothing like that described for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">economics</ENAMEX>. An article cannot take more than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several months</TIMEX> to transit from
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> writing until publication or it will be completely out of date, as there
are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a half dozen</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> working on closely related experiments who will have
reported *their* results. Moreover, new information is new; it does not have to
knock over a theoretical predisposition to be "news" and thus publishable.

            In the clinical literature, this kind of
examination of "hypothesis confirmation" is fairly common, and there is
certainly some wobble. A series of clinical trials can reach different
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">conclusions</ENAMEX>, and a meta-analysis that pools information from multiple trials
can lead to a conclusion different from a large "definitive" clinical trial.
But that's a signal for further empiricism, not a theoretical point that there
is no way to get better evidence or improve certainty that one is "right."
There is certainly publication bias in that the probability of publication is
higher for positive results (improved clinical outcome, for example) than no
results.

            But what has this got to
do with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Sokal</ENAMEX>? I can't make the leap from a largely rhetorical field of
analysis to experimental fields that report new data. The line of argument
seems to be that since hypotheses in academic economics have not been confirmed
means that the same would be true for all fields whether theoretical or
experimental, and therefore fields that rest on empirical evidence must be
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">castles</ENAMEX> in the sky. The analogies are not strong enough to allow leaps of faith
that long.

            An interesting phenomenon related to that discussed
in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven Landsburg</ENAMEX>'s article concerns the truth of hypotheses published in
scientific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX> that are then reported in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX>, weekly news
magazines, and discussed on television news shows. Although I don't have any
systematic data on this, I suspect that the trend that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Landsburg</ENAMEX> describes
would be amplified in the following way: if you read in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX> about a
theory that has been published in a prestigious scientific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journal</ENAMEX>, it is even
more likely to be wrong than an article that is published in a prestigious
scientific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journal</ENAMEX> that is not widely reported. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Reporters</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> decide
what hypotheses are newsworthy and likely to evoke interest in their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX>
and, for the same reasons discussed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Landsburg</ENAMEX>'s article, this selection
criteria are not especially effective at selecting the true scientific
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypothesis</ENAMEX>.

            An example of this can be seen in the scientific
research program that I discuss in my book <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Mismeasure of Desire: The</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Science</ENAMEX>, Theory and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ethics of Sexual Orientation</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxford University Press</ENAMEX>,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> studies concerning the origins of male homosexuality done in the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last decade</TIMEX> garnered a great deal of attention in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LeVay</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neuroanatomical</ENAMEX> study, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hamer</ENAMEX>'s genetic study and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bailey</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pillard</ENAMEX>'s twin
studies). Together the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> have been widely understood as establishing that
sexual orientation is genetically determined. However, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LeVay's</ENAMEX> study was done
on a small and perhaps atypical sample and it has not be replicated, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hamer</ENAMEX>'s
study has been disconfirmed by other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">labs</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bailey</ENAMEX>'s latest and more
systematic twin study undermines his early ones. Although the original studies
received a great deal of attention and are widely accepted, the serious
problems with them have not been discussed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX>.

            Although it is easier to
disconfirm a hypothesis than to establish one, disconfirmations are much less
likely to be deemed newsworthy. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Readers</ENAMEX> of media reports of scientific
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypotheses</ENAMEX> need to read with especially critical and skeptical eyes.

            You'll all have to
forgive me but I just don't seem to understand what is so "hip" about some
white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> with a name like "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Heather Renee French</ENAMEX>," who comes from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kentucky</ENAMEX>
and works for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">charities</ENAMEX> based on a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> for her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>. Kind probably,
average definitely, attractive moderately, but hip? I've been living in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Korea</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few years</TIMEX> now, so perhaps I'm not as on the ball when it comes to
such matters but if this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> is "hip" in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX> then I may seriously
consider citizenship right here where I am.
