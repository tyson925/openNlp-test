            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">John</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">F. Kennedy Jr.</ENAMEX> was laid to rest. The ashes of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kennedy</ENAMEX>, his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister-in-law</ENAMEX> were scattered at sea. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los Angeles Times</ENAMEX> attributed
the crash to a piloting error by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kennedy</ENAMEX>, but a tidal wave of eulogies
(including this one from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> ) blamed a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">curse</ENAMEX>
on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kennedy</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clan</ENAMEX>. Other explanations: The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> cited

that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kennedy</ENAMEX> had been obliged to schedule the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Vineyard</ENAMEX> landing by his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> , and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fortune</ENAMEX> says that Wall Street is blaming <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morgan Stanley</ENAMEX> for making JFK
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jr.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister-in-law</ENAMEX> work <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">late</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jerusalem Post</ENAMEX> pointed to a
"novelty-seeking and risk-taking gene discovered in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX>" (see "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International</ENAMEX>
Papers" for ). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Kelly</ENAMEX> asks <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> why "we lard
up the sorrow with this great and gross festival of national media blah-blah about

               <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> gathered support for a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$792 billion</NUMEX> tax-cut plan.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GOP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> appeased <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">moderates</ENAMEX> by agreeing to condition the cuts on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yearly</TIMEX>
reductions in the federal debt. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Ways and</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Means</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Archer</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>, accuses <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX> of supporting
"big government 
                  on 
                  autopilot
               " and
argues that the cuts epitomize compassionate conservatism. But deficit-hawk
ex-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sens.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam Nunn</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Warren Rudman</ENAMEX> assert in the same pages that the surplus
should be used to pay down the deficit . <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> warned, "I
will not allow a risky plan to become law."

            

               The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> spent <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">hundreds of millions of dollars</NUMEX> on projects
unapproved by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>. According to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> , a
congressional report accuses the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> of funding a top-secret <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX>
program, an <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$800 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">satellite</ENAMEX>, a high-tech missile defense system
previously rejected by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>, and other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">unapproved</ENAMEX> purchases. The report
expresses shock at the flagrant illegality of the expenditures. "Do we get it
right <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100 percent</NUMEX> of the time? Of course not," the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> responded.

            

               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ehud Barak</ENAMEX> pledged to strike peace deals with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Syria</ENAMEX> and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Palestinians</ENAMEX> within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15 months</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Syria</ENAMEX> responded by asking radical
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Palestinian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Damascus</ENAMEX> to end their attacks on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX>. His meetings

                why <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israelis</ENAMEX>
are . In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Kissinger</ENAMEX> warned <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israelis</ENAMEX>
not to leave the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> out of the peace
process, while an op-ed piece in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israeli</ENAMEX> paper <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ha'aretz</ENAMEX> cautioned
that congressional <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX>, under the sway of the right-wing <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israeli</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Likud</ENAMEX>
Party, will "throw spikes into the newly energized peace train."

            
Security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> quelled student protests in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX>. Young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> had
staged protests, thrown <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stones</ENAMEX>, and set police <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicles</ENAMEX> on fire. Pro-government
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conservatives</ENAMEX> rallied right back. "" compares the uprising to civil war and the
fall of the Iron Curtain, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Iranian</ENAMEX> newspaper <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Neshat</ENAMEX> argues that
revolution is "neither possible nor desirable." The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> '
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Friedman</ENAMEX> calls them both wrong, saying <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Iranians</ENAMEX> simply want the
government "to get out of their lives so they can freely partake of the
prosperity, cultural options, and opportunities that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s
world-without-walls offers."

            

               <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diplomats</ENAMEX> will try to soothe tension between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> abandoned its "<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>" policy, which implied
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>'s sovereignty over and eventual reunification with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX>. "Don't
underestimate the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>'s firm determination to uphold national
sovereignty, dignity, and territorial integrity," warned the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> Foreign
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ministry</ENAMEX> in response. An editorial from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xinhua</ENAMEX> news <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> vilified
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee Teng</ENAMEX>-hui for venturing down "a dead <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">alley</ENAMEX>" and swimming
against the "historical tide" of unification. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Weekly Standard</ENAMEX>
argues that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> should back <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> with words now and, if necessary, military
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">force</ENAMEX> later, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> reports that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">envoys</ENAMEX> will
pressure him to back down. The Wall Street
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal</ENAMEX> predicted that the spat will blow over when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> steps down in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eight months</TIMEX>.

            

               The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> agreed that a new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> should supervise nuclear weapons
research. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> would report directly to the secretary of energy.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Sponsors</ENAMEX> of the plan said it would institute accountability for security
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">breaches</ENAMEX>, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> reportedly prefers an even stronger independent
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agency</ENAMEX>.

            

               <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> enacted the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>'s strictest ban on assault
weapons. It eliminates loopholes that previously allowed gun
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturers</ENAMEX> to evade restrictions by renaming or slightly altering their
weapons. Another new law restricts gun <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapon</ENAMEX> purchase per month.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los Angeles Times</ENAMEX> gives its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blessing</ENAMEX> , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> reports that
the ban bodes well for tighter gun control in other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>.

            

               <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Forbes</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">N.Y.</ENAMEX>, defected to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Democratic Party</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> reports that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democratic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> courted <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Forbes</ENAMEX>, a conservative who opposes abortion
and gun control, in a drive to claim the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> seats they need for a majority.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Republican Congressional Committee</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chair</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Davis</ENAMEX> denigrated <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Forbes</ENAMEX>'
decision by likening it to "many of his past actions, inconsistent and
erratic." <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jodi Kantor</ENAMEX> in 
                  Slate
                how <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Forbes</ENAMEX> made the
move, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Brooks</ENAMEX> explains in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> why: "party
loyalty and gratitude are never allowed to get in the way of the epic personal
drama that exists in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politician</ENAMEX>'s own mind."

            

               
                  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> passed compromise <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>' rights
legislation.
                <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> defeated a plan to let <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> sue
their HMOs but approved more access to emergency care and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX> protested that the reforms would apply to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fewer than one-third</NUMEX> of the
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">161 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> with private insurance. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> awards
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GOP</ENAMEX> "a clean win on an issue of prime importance to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX>" but foresees an election-time brawl. "<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> we saw what
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'compassionate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conservativism</ENAMEX>' pretends to be," harrumphed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barbara</ENAMEX>

managed care has bought <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> votes and that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> will die as a
result.

            

               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cigars</ENAMEX> will carry warnings similar to those on cigarettes. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Trade Commission</ENAMEX> said the current
absence of labels implies "that cigars are a safe alternative to
cigarettes." Industry <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">honchos</ENAMEX> protested that "cigar <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">smokers</ENAMEX> are mature,
well-informed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> who smoke on an occasional basis."

            

               <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX> want <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerry Springer</ENAMEX> to run for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democratic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Columbus</ENAMEX> area have discussed the idea with Springer
and the state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX>. Politics has become entertainment, a political consultant
shrugged to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Associated Press</ENAMEX>.

            

               A generic drug may prevent death by <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart failure</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Researchers</ENAMEX>
announced that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spironolactone</ENAMEX>, a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40-year-old</TIMEX>, inexpensive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medication</ENAMEX> used to
treat water retention, cut death from congestive <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart failure</ENAMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 percent</NUMEX> in
experimental trials. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twenty million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> suffer from this heart condition
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">worldwide</ENAMEX>. Half of them die within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five years</TIMEX> of diagnosis. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New England</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal of Medicine</ENAMEX> rushed the story to
press.

            

               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX> introduced iMac laptops. The iBook, pictured here , can function like a
cordless phone, allowing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> to connect to the Internet while roaming up to
<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">150 feet</NUMEX> from a telephone jack. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> predict it will fuel sales of laptops
to the home market in general and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>'s turnaround in particular.

            

               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hewlett-Packard</ENAMEX> chose a female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">CEO</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carleton S.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fiorina</ENAMEX> will be the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">CEO</ENAMEX> among the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> biggest publicly
held <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> among the Fortune 500. The Wall Street
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal</ENAMEX> says the choice proves that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H-P</ENAMEX> "is serious about continuing to
revamp its stodgy image," while a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> editorial calls it
evidence that the glass ceiling "is at least cracking."

            

               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Cone</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Yankees</ENAMEX> pitched a perfect game. It
was the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">16 th</NUMEX> perfect game in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Major League Baseball</ENAMEX> history. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Daily News</ENAMEX> boasted of "<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Yankee</ENAMEX> magic," fueled by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yogi Berra</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Don Larsen</ENAMEX>'s presence at
the game. Even the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canadian Globe and Mail</ENAMEX> 
               agreed .

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Lawrie</ENAMEX> won
<ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">golf</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Open</ENAMEX>. Lawrie, ranked <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">159 th</NUMEX> in the world,
began the final round <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> strokes back but advanced to a three-way playoff when
tournament <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jean Van de Velde</ENAMEX> choked away a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-stroke lead on the
final hole. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Associated Press</ENAMEX> effused that "the most stunning collapse in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">golf</ENAMEX> gave way to the greatest comeback in the history of major
championships." The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scottish Press and Journal</ENAMEX> celebrated the triumph of
its native
