            An , and it must perforce be answered. The charge?
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fiddling</ENAMEX>. No, not the fiddling of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nero</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nashville</ENAMEX>. The matter is more
serious.

            For those not in the
academic racket, or with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> long out of college or not long out of diapers,
it might seem a trifling matter. But to anyone with an abiding interest in
higher education, the stakes don't get much higher. Because the fiddling charge
arises in the context of college rankings . In the hushed groves of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">academia</ENAMEX>, few things cause more consternation than an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">outsider</ENAMEX> using numeral
measurements to gauge academic performance--even though <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">colleges</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">universities</ENAMEX> rely on similar measurements to rate their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">applicants</ENAMEX>.

            Here's the deal. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">educators</ENAMEX> say it's absurd to think
that the intangibles of a college education can be reduced to mere numbers, and
they're right. But for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than a decade</TIMEX> now, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. News & World</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Report</ENAMEX> has been providing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> a way to assess the most
important factor in choosing a college: academic excellence. Obviously, that's
not the only thing to think about when selecting a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>. But <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> find the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX>'s assessments useful. And it's a measure of the
seriousness with which they're taken that deans and admissions <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> compete
fiercely to better their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>' rankings from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year to year</TIMEX>.

            Comes now the fiddling
business. Writing in the pages of 
                  Slate
               , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce Gottlieb</ENAMEX> is
admirably forthright in his condemnation. "[<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>]he <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. News</ENAMEX> "
he writes, "fiddled with the rules" in preparing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX>'s college rankings.
The provocation for the charge? <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">This year</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> ranked the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institute of Technology</ENAMEX> first among national <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">universities</ENAMEX>, up from the No. 9
position just <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year ago</TIMEX>. "This was dramatic," Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gottlieb</ENAMEX> writes, "since
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caltech</ENAMEX>, while highly regarded, is not normally thought of as No. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>."

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fair</ENAMEX> enough. We welcome challenges to our methodology and
use them to refine and improve our rankings. To Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gottlieb</ENAMEX>'s gimlet eye,
however, there is mischief afoot. In awarding the No. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> slot to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caltech</ENAMEX>, he
writes, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> generated a sense of "surprise" by toppling last
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>'s "uninteresting three-way tie among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yale</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Princeton</ENAMEX>" for
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> place. "Nobody's going to pay much attention" to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX>'s rankings,
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gottlieb</ENAMEX> writes, "if it's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yale</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Princeton</ENAMEX> again and again,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>." Ergo, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> "fiddled" the thing to generate a bit of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">buzz</ENAMEX>.

            The charge bears
examination. Never mind that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gottlieb</ENAMEX>, a former 
                  Slate
                staff
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX>, is currently enrolled at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard Law School</ENAMEX>. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">One</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> and one's
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother abjure</ENAMEX> questions of motive.) But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gottlieb</ENAMEX> is a self-described
student of econometrics, which our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Webster</ENAMEX>'s defines as "the use of
mathematical and statistical methods in the field of economics to verify and
develop economic theories." Put aside for a moment that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. News</ENAMEX>
rankings have virtually nothing to do with economic theory. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> may posit that
a mind used to grappling with the kudzu of econometrics is more than up to the
task of dissecting something as relatively straightforward as college
rankings.

            How is it, then, that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gottlieb</ENAMEX> falls so short of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mark</ENAMEX>? The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX>'s methodology for determining the rankings is based on a
weighted sum of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> numerical factors. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gottlieb</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">econometrician</ENAMEX> somehow
manages to misapprehend even the most basic of these. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX>, he says,
rates <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> on "average <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> size." Wrong. It's the percentage of classes
with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fewer than 20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> and the percentage of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> or
more. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. News</ENAMEX> , says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gottlieb</ENAMEX>, also rates <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> on the "amount of
alumni giving." Sadly, the econometrician gets it wrong once again. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">magazine</ENAMEX> ranks <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> on the rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alumni</ENAMEX> giving--the percentage of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alumni</ENAMEX> who donate money to their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>.

            But that is to cavil. It
is not until he is well launched on his wrongheaded bill of particulars that
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gottlieb</ENAMEX> makes an interesting concession. "I can't prove that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
News keeps changing the rules simply in order to change the results," he
writes. No matter. The charge is leveled, and like a parched <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> finally led to
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gottlieb</ENAMEX> keeps drinking and drinking.

            Summing up, at long last, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gottlieb</ENAMEX> concludes that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">success</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX>'s rankings "actually depends on confounding most
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">peoples</ENAMEX>' intuition" about which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">colleges</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">universities</ENAMEX> are the best. Had he
bothered conducting even the most rudimentary research, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gottlieb</ENAMEX> would have
seen that the charge is without merit. Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past 10 years</TIMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991-2000</TIMEX>), the
top <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> national <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">universities</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. News</ENAMEX> rankings have remained
remarkably consistent. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Eleven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> have been in the top <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every single year</TIMEX>
for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a decade</TIMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Every year</TIMEX> the top <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> have varied from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the previous year</TIMEX>'s top <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>
by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one or fewer</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past five years</TIMEX>, the top <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> have been exactly
the same top <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>. Yes, the "uninteresting" triumvirate of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yale</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Princeton</ENAMEX> has been there all along. So have <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> like the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Massachusetts</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institute of Technology</ENAMEX> and others that virtually any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX> would number among
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s best <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX> of higher education. And, yes, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gottlieb</ENAMEX>, so has
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caltech</ENAMEX>.

            These are data even an
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">econometrician</ENAMEX> should be able to understand.

            

               
                  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce</ENAMEX>
                
               
                  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gottlieb</ENAMEX> replies:
               
            

            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">One week ago</TIMEX>, I wrote an in these pages criticizing
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. News</ENAMEX> ' "best <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">colleges</ENAMEX>" rankings. I had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> gripes. First, that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. News</ENAMEX> fiddles with its rankings to improve newsstand sales. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>,
that the rankings suffer from a serious conceptual flaw.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brian Duffy</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Cary</ENAMEX> have written a rebuttal,
to which I have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> objections.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Duffy/Cary</ENAMEX> response is padded with references
to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nero</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nashville</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Webster's dictionary</ENAMEX>, but neglects to even address my
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> gripe. This is especially odd since this charge--that the rankings are
cargo-cult statistical research--seems the more damning of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>.

            Does their silence mean
they grant the point?

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. Their comments also show a willful or
inadvertent misunderstanding of my first gripe. They essentially say there's
nothing necessarily fishy about changes--like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caltech</ENAMEX> going from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">No. 9</NUMEX> to No.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>--that surprise <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fair</ENAMEX> enough, but totally beside the point. I'm not
saying there's something fishy about any <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX>-place jump--I'm saying
there's something clearly fishy about this particular jump.

            Specifically, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX>'s methodology
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">section</ENAMEX> rejected the very statistical procedure--known as
"standardization"--which <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> propelled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caltech</ENAMEX> to the top of the list.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> said that standardization would be unfair. Now, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years later</TIMEX>,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> performs a complete about face-- with no mention of their
previous stance !

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Duffy/Cary</ENAMEX>'s explanation for the flip-flop is that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. News</ENAMEX> "welcomes" suggested improvements, presumably including the
idea of standardizing variables. The idea that they switched to this technique
because it was suggested to them--by whom, I wonder?--is preposterous. They
were surely aware that it was an option in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>, when they explained why it was
an inferior technique. Furthermore, "standardization" is not some
will-o'-the-wisp notion whose stock rises and falls upon weekly pronouncements
from what <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Duffy/Cary</ENAMEX> call "the hushed groves of academia." It is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Statistics</ENAMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">101</NUMEX> idea, known to anyone who's ever opened an introductory textbook.

            So what can explain the flip-flop that propelled
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caltech</ENAMEX> to the top? Perhaps we should follow the money. In their rebuttal,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Duffy</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cary</ENAMEX> do not dispute that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. News</ENAMEX> benefits financially when
the rankings change.

            Moreover, the magazine
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) dishonestly implies that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caltech</ENAMEX>, rather than the ranking formulas, have
changed with the headline "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Caltech Comes Out on Top"</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) employs linguistic
trickery to downplay how much the methodological flip-flop helped <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caltech</ENAMEX>; and
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) fails to mention that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caltech</ENAMEX> probably declined in quality <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> if the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. News</ENAMEX> standards are taken seriously. Put simply, the "fiddling"
theory explains the facts better than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Duffy/Cary</ENAMEX>'s assertion that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News</ENAMEX> strives for the truth.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. In addition to supposedly mimicking "a parched
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> finally led to water"-- what on earth does this mean? --I stand
accused as a "self-described <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> of econometrics." At <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> glance, I was
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">baffled</ENAMEX>.

            For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> thing, nowhere in the article do I use the
word "econometrics." And the only statistical example I give is about
<ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">baseball</ENAMEX>.

            Then I remembered my
phone conversation about methodology with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. News</ENAMEX> ' resident
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">statistical</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Morse</ENAMEX>. He began our interview by asking me about my
statistical background, presumably to know where to begin his explanation. I
replied that I'd taken several econometrics <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX> as an undergraduate and had
spent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> working at a statistical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">consultancy firm</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">D.C.</ENAMEX>,
called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mathematica Policy Research</ENAMEX> . At the time, he seemed rather
pleased to hear this and flattered me that few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX> had similar grounding
in statistical theory.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Duffy/Cary</ENAMEX> end by noting that "even an
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">econometrician</ENAMEX>" can see that the top <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> on their list don't change much
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">from year to year</TIMEX>. This is meant to disarm my conclusion that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. News</ENAMEX>
fiddles with the rankings to confound our intuition and sell <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazines</ENAMEX>.
However, as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Duffy/Cary</ENAMEX> are well aware, it's perfectly possible to keep the top
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">colleges</ENAMEX> static, and still generate buzz by, say, moving No. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> up to No.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>.

            Lastly, they seem especially proud of the fact that
the top <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> contains all those <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> we intuitively feel are the "<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s
best." Well, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> question: If the rankings just confirm intuition, then why buy
them in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> place? Could it be to see who is No. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX>?
