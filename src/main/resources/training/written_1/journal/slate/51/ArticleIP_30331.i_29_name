Little did I realize, when I typed the charmed words "paper shredder," how much
I missed them. And, judging by your replies, you do too. And so my gift to you:
a piece of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oliver North</ENAMEX> e-mail obtained by that wonderful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Security Archive</ENAMEX>. (If you like this sort of thing, it has published an
entire book of it.)

            

               3/28/86
From: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oliver North</ENAMEX>
To: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fawn Hall</ENAMEX>
Subject: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Movie</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Contras</ENAMEX>

               
Originally classified secret; now unclassified.

               A
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> of mine in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">N.Y.</ENAMEX> is leading <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stockholder</ENAMEX> in a movie production <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> and
sent one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principals</ENAMEX> to me to help package a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2 million</NUMEX> budget for a
feature film called "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Contras</ENAMEX>." It will be a credible work about a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jewish Kid</ENAMEX>
who gets thrown in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">jail</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nicaragua</ENAMEX>, is freed by a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Contra</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> and eventually
sides with them for the right reasons. There is a script currently being
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">edited</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Nouri</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Flashdance</ENAMEX>) will be the male lead; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Brunner</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Force</ENAMEX>, Missing in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Action</ENAMEX>) will do the screenplay and probably direct. There are
a number of stupid films in the works on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Central Amer</ENAMEX>. that all come out on the
wrong side. I think we should help these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> out if possible. I have met
them and they are serious, talented and well-connected in the industry. There
is no better way to grab those hearts and minds we need.

            

            The script, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Calf</ENAMEX> , never got shot. But what can you expect? Look what
those <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bastards</ENAMEX> did to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Stern</ENAMEX> and The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chimp Channel</ENAMEX> . See below.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Artificial Holiday Answer</ENAMEX>
            

            All are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Father</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Day</TIMEX> gifts advertised in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> .

            

               The paper shredder (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$39.99</NUMEX>) "offers peace of mind" and a tangible way to
say, "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dad</ENAMEX>, you've got something to hide."

               The leather picture frame (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$75</NUMEX>) says, "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dad</ENAMEX>, you're not ashamed of your
sadomasochistic pornography."

               And the underwear (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$9.37</NUMEX>) says, "Oh, lordy, I'm
picturing my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> naked, although forbidden to do so by the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bible</ENAMEX> and good
sense."

costumed chimps with dubbed human voices, has been plagued by trouble on the

bottle of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> and a bottle of beer" on the set. "Through improv comedy, I was

taking," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stern</ENAMEX> told <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daily Variety</ENAMEX> . "I was

comedy." <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scott</ENAMEX> is said to have demanded more sophisticated jokes involving
farting costumed monkeys.
