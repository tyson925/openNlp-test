            Throw out your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealer</ENAMEX>'s
telephone number--why take risks when your <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">supermarket</ENAMEX> is selling <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>? OK,
not real <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>, but nutritional supplements , which are winning over our
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">drug-abuse</ENAMEX> dollar. Corner <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> now stock <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint Johnswort, Snapples</ENAMEX> come
spiked with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ginseng</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">juice bars sprinkle ginkgo</ENAMEX> on smoothies. Supplements
are an <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$8.9 billion</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> business now, bigger than the domestic box office of
movies. Largely unregulated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Food and Drug Administration</ENAMEX>, these
over-the-counter compounds are legal for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12-year-olds</TIMEX> to buy. But can they get
you wasted? Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX> I ran up a tab at my local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Nutrition</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center</ENAMEX>--a chain with booming sales growth largely because it rounds up the
usual supplements. After sampling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GNC</ENAMEX>'s wares, I checked my findings against
the wisdom of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ray</ENAMEX>
Sahelian, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">M.D.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> who swears by supplements, has
tried them all, and has authored several books on the matter. Here's what I
learned:

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint</ENAMEX>

               Johnswort
            

            
               For
               : Mild to serious
<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">depression</ENAMEX>.

            
               How 
               it works: It's a
flower. Studies suggest it (like everything halfway fun <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these days</TIMEX>) plays with
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neurotransmitter</ENAMEX> levels, boosting serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine.

            
               My 
               findings: The bottle
recommended <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">three 300-milligram</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pills</ENAMEX> per day. I took <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>. On the
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the third day</TIMEX> (it takes a while for the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> to rev up), I felt a
sudden rush of well-being. I was reading a good book and eating a great
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sandwich</ENAMEX>, and admittedly this in itself may account for my good cheer. But it
felt more profound--what should have been just a sandwich was a

                  sandwich
               , what should have been just a book was a

                  book
               . Does that make sense? It did at the time.

            By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Day 4</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">manic</ENAMEX> rushes were kicking in. At
unpredictable moments I'd become hypersocial, expansive, and breathtakingly
productive. It was not unlike a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocaine</ENAMEX> high (er, I'm told). That is, a
surprise <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocaine</ENAMEX> high that strikes at random. I'd be in a meeting with my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boss</ENAMEX>
and suddenly I was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robin Williams</ENAMEX> circa <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1980</TIMEX>. These Wort flashes were sort of
delightful the first few times, but I grew to fear them--I couldn't predict
when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wort</ENAMEX> would attack. And along with the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">manic</TIMEX> highs came troughs of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fragility</ENAMEX> and moodiness.

            Hoping to push the envelope, I eventually doubled
my dosage. Result: a jaw-clenching headache of unfathomable depth, coupled with
horrid, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">abyss-gazing</ENAMEX> doubt and need. I quit <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next day</TIMEX>.

            
               The doc 
               says: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sahelian</ENAMEX>'s a
big <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fan</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Wort</ENAMEX>. He thinks it works almost as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Prozac</ENAMEX>, without the
side effects or high price. "Doesn't it add a little magic to the world? It's
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">great</ENAMEX> to take when traveling--the things you see become more special." I'd
guess he means something like my 
                  sandwich
                moment. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sahelian</ENAMEX> says
that since I wasn't depressed to start with, taking the maximum dosage of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wort</ENAMEX>
pushed me into mania. He starts <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> off with one pill a day, and only goes
to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> for extreme depression. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oops</ENAMEX>. Although I'm not depressed, I may try a
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-per-day regimen in the future--maybe I could be even happier .

It's "nature's sleeping pill."

            
               How 
               it works: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Melatonin</ENAMEX> is a
natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormone</ENAMEX> (produced by the pineal gland) that seems to regulate your
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">internal</ENAMEX> clock.

            
               My 
               findings: I get insomnia,
so I was excited about melatonin. The bottle suggested <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">one 3-milligram</NUMEX> tablet
before bedtime. I obeyed, but nothing happened: I was still sleepless. Instead,
I felt sluggish <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the entire next day</TIMEX>. Results were no better on subsequent
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">nights</TIMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">A few nights</TIMEX> in, I had a vivid nightmare. I was at a picnic where
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> played a game--a game in which they attempted to flay each other using
hand-held metal hooks, stripping skin away from their ribs and spines. I quit
the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next day</TIMEX>.

            
               The 
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">doc</ENAMEX> says: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> milligrams a
night is waaaaay too much. He recommends <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a half-milligram to 1 milligram</NUMEX>, one
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hour</TIMEX> before bed, no more than once a week . Vivid dreams are common
("dreams like you've never dreamed before," says the doc, and I concur), but so
is restful sleep.

               Kava

               Kava
            

            
               For
               : <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Anxiety</ENAMEX>.

            
               How 
               it works: Who knows?
It's a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> from the pepper <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, and its roots may affect your limbic
system.

            
               My 
               findings: I bought kava
in liquid extract form, to be taken with an eyedropper. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">label</ENAMEX> said <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
milliliters <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX>. I took <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> milliliters all at once. No dice. Then
I took <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> milliliters all at once. Less dice, if that's possible. Finally, I
took <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> milliliters all at once--<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> times the suggested dosage. Beyond a
teensy sense of detachment and some mild balance problems, I still felt
nothing.

            
               The 
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">doc</ENAMEX> says: Sahelian
(<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Kava: The Anti-Anxiety Herb</ENAMEX> ) tells me that with kava the
brand makes a huge difference. Indeed, on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lycaeum</ENAMEX> "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trip</ENAMEX>
Reports " page, one "psychonaut" recommends "Waka-grade <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Kava</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fiji</ENAMEX>."
Mine came from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nature</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Way Products</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Springville</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Utah</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sahelian</ENAMEX> says: "If
you're not anxious, you won't notice much. But those who like it really
like it. It's great if you're nervous going on a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> or to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dentist</ENAMEX>, or
before a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX>. Some use it as an alternative to <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the evening</TIMEX> martini." A
mischievous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> swears that if you slug back a whole bottle you'll act like
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dopey</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dwarf</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a few hours</TIMEX>, but I cannot confirm at this time.

               it works: <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Again with the</ENAMEX>

               My 
               findings: I don't have
<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX>. I also don't have <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">depression</ENAMEX>, but that never stopped me before. The
bottle said <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100-milligram</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pills</ENAMEX> per day. I took <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX>. I
felt nothing.

            
               The 
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">doc</ENAMEX> says: Despite the
slobber of media excitement dripped all over SAMe in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last few months</TIMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Sahelian</ENAMEX> prefers <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint Johnswort</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wort</ENAMEX> is much less expensive and he thinks
it works better. When I sounded disappointed about SAMe, he offered this tip:
"If you want to feel something, try taking <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three or four</NUMEX> pills in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX>
on an empty stomach." I tried <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the next morning</TIMEX>. More nothing.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">colds</ENAMEX>.

            
               How 
               they work, allegedly:
Ginseng improves adrenal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">gland</ENAMEX> function, ginkgo helps circulation, and
Echinacea boosts white blood cells. They're all herbs.

            
               My 
               findings: I bought
Siberian <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ginseng gum</ENAMEX> and chewed a bunch but felt no particular vitality. So,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Pros</ENAMEX>: none. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cons</ENAMEX>: acrid aftertaste, acrid duringtaste, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> vitality increase,
and I had to find somewhere to spit it out. If you want to try <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ginseng</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Siberian</ENAMEX> is supposedly the best (as opposed to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asian</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>). I also took
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ginkgo</ENAMEX>. I also felt nothing. As for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Echinacea</ENAMEX>, I've used it successfully a few
times, though not in a controlled study. The key is to take it just as you're
getting a cold--it appears to head it off. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Friends</ENAMEX> have reported similar
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">success</ENAMEX>.

            
               The 
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">doc</ENAMEX> says: Sahelian
seemed less enthusiastic about these. He says effectiveness varies dramatically
between brands, and that ginkgo shows more impact on older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, improving
focus and alertness.

               Conclusion
            

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Wort</ENAMEX> can be fun, and it might save you a bundle
on your <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Prozac</ENAMEX> bill. I'm willing to give melatonin another shot, too--at
reduced dosage. But basically this stuff is all weak <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sauce</ENAMEX>. If you're looking
for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> to improve your "mood" or "mental <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">alertness</ENAMEX>," don't throw out your
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealer</ENAMEX>'s number just yet: The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> that come closest to achieving these worthy
goals remain highly illegal or must be prescribed by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX>. The success of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GNC</ENAMEX> and the nutritional supplement industry illustrates how eager our culture
is to embrace mood-altering <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>--as long as they don't actually work.
