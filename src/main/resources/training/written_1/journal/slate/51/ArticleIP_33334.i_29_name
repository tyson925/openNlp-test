            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kelvin Lancaster</ENAMEX> died <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last month</TIMEX>. He was an
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX>, famous within the profession (when an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> uses the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">adjective "Lancastrian</ENAMEX>," he isn't talking about the Wars of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Roses</ENAMEX>), but
largely unknown beyond it. I can't claim to have known him personally: I was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years old</TIMEX> when his famous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> on the theory of the "<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> best" was
published (click to read more about it), and we probably met <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">only four or five</TIMEX>
times. But nonetheless there was a time, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of decades ago</TIMEX>, when we were
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">comrades</ENAMEX>-in-<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX>--when he and I, along with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several dozen</NUMEX> other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, helped
make a revolution in economic theory.

            That revolution went unnoticed among the wider
public, even among those who follow (or think that they follow) economic
thinking. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Warsh</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boston Globe</ENAMEX> wrote an excellent series of
articles about some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">revolutionaries</ENAMEX>, and he's in the process of
finishing a book-length treatment. But other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalists</ENAMEX> ignored the story, or
if they did write anything got it wrong, preferring camera-ready fantasies in
which heroic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">outsiders</ENAMEX> challenged an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">obtuse Establishment</ENAMEX>. I've tried elsewhere
to correct some of the myths (click to read my article on the power of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biobabble</ENAMEX> and to read about the legend of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brian Arthur</ENAMEX>), but maybe <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lancaster</ENAMEX>'s
death is a good occasion for me to wax nostalgic, to recall what actually
did happen.

            To understand the
revolution, you need to grasp <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> related dichotomies. One is that between
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">constant</ENAMEX> and increasing returns; the other between perfect and imperfect
competition. Constant returns is the assumption that if you increase your
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inputs</ENAMEX>, your output will grow by the same amount--e.g., if you double your
inputs you will also double your output. Increasing returns, on the other hand,
says that doubling inputs will more than double output. Perfect
competition is the assumption that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producers</ENAMEX> are like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wheat</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX>, who take
the price of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wheat</ENAMEX> as a given--and not like, say, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>, which must decide what
to charge for an iMac and can choose within limits to raise that price if it is
willing to accept a reduction in sales.

            Perfect competition and constant returns go together like
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cookies</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk</ENAMEX>; without constant returns, the assumption of perfect
competition becomes very hard to swallow. The reason, basically, is that when
there are increasing returns an industry will tend to become dominated by at
most a few large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">players</ENAMEX>, and these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX> are bound to realize that they have
some price-setting power. They are also likely to realize both that it is in
their common interest to agree, at least tacitly, to set prices high, and that
it is in their individual interest to cheat on that agreement and undercut
their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">rivals</ENAMEX>. Is the eventual result a stable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cartel</ENAMEX>, a perpetual price war, or
an irregular alternation between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>? Hard to say. But what has long been
clear to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> is that increasing returns normally lead to imperfect
competition, and that imperfect competition can be a messy and intractable
subject.

            That recognition, in
turn, led the profession to spend <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about a century</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a half</TIMEX>--from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">David</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ricardo</ENAMEX> until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1970s</TIMEX>--concentrating its theoretical energy on models that
assumed constant returns and perfect competition, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> tended to
avoid questions where increasing returns or imperfect competition were
self-evidently crucial. In so doing they were neither foolish nor dogmatic:
Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX>, I think, understood that increasing returns are sometimes
important, and a few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> did try to take them into account. (In my
specialty, international trade theory, increasing-returns analysis is usually
dated from a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1925</TIMEX> paper by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Princeton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Graham</ENAMEX>; the first
fully worked-out mathematical model was published by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">R.C.O. Matthews</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1950</TIMEX>.)
But useful theorizing in complex subjects such as economics is always a matter
of choosing the right strategic simplification, and for a long time it seemed
that the clarity of constant-returns/perfect-competition analysis justified its
violence to reality. Even now, one can say--and I did, back in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>--that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">95</NUMEX>
percent of the time, it would be a blessing if <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> could understand
what's right about the constant returns model, not what's wrong with it.

            By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1970s</TIMEX>, however, patience with constant-returns
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">economics</ENAMEX> was wearing thin. Exactly why is hard to say. I don't think you can
claim that returns were less constant or competition less perfect in the real
world of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1975</TIMEX> than they had been in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1955</TIMEX>, or even <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1925</TIMEX>. More likely, the
driving force was the field's internal intellectual logic: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Economists</ENAMEX> had
answered most of the interesting questions they could ask in the old framework
and found that constant-returns economics was running into, well, diminishing
returns. And so they were finally ready to try something different.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kelvin Lancaster</ENAMEX> was one
of those who was driven to increasing returns. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s</TIMEX> he had introduced a
seemingly obvious but highly useful twist to the analysis of consumer behavior
by pointing out that what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> often want is not so much a specific
product as a particular bundle of characteristics. To take a modern example,
what business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">travelers</ENAMEX> care about in their notebook computers are low weight,
long battery life, and high computing power, rather than the logo on the case.
There are trade-offs among these good things; what differentiates one notebook
from another is where in this "characteristics space" they are located. But in
that case, why doesn't the market produce every possible notebook? (Much as I
love my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hewlett-Packard Jornada</ENAMEX> handheld, I'd prefer a machine with a slightly
better word processor, for which I would happily sacrifice something else.) The
answer, of course, is increasing returns: To proliferate varieties (and hence
to produce each variety at a smaller scale) means to increase costs.

            Now at this point <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lancaster</ENAMEX> found himself up against the
usual problem: Increasing returns mean imperfect competition, and in general
imperfect competition is nasty stuff. But somehow, circa <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1974</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> went
through a shift in mindset. My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleague</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Solow</ENAMEX> likes to say that there
are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> kinds of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX>: those who look for general results and those who
look for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">illuminating</ENAMEX> examples. And more or less suddenly fell into the second
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX>; they decided that while a general theory of how imperfect competition
must work was never going to happen, it was OK to focus on interesting
examples of how it might work. How does the market for an industry with
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lancaster</ENAMEX>-type differentiated products function? It could be dominated by a
single <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX> that proliferates products to deter potential <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">competitors</ENAMEX>--OK, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dick</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schmalensee</ENAMEX> wrote up that story. Or it could be "monopolistically competitive,"
each variety produced by a different <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX>--OK, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Salop</ENAMEX> wrote that up in one
version, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike Spence</ENAMEX> in another, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avinash Dixit</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe Stiglitz</ENAMEX> in yet another.
The point was to find stories that hung together, not determine once and for
all which was right.

            It's hard to convey, if
you weren't there, just how liberating this was. Once they decided it was OK to
tell illustrative stories rather than produce theorems, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> could write
about exciting topics that had been off limits: predatory pricing, strategic
investment to get the jump on competition, technological races, struggles to
define industry standards. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jean Tirole</ENAMEX> published his landmark
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">textbook The Theory of Industrial Organization</ENAMEX> , just about every idea
about the "new economy" that trendy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> proclaim as a radical departure
from conventional economic thought was, well, already in the textbook.

            Among other things, someone was bound to notice that the
interaction between increasing returns and product differentiation could help
explain some puzzles about international trade--like why most trade is between
seemingly similar <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late '70s</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> independently wrote
up that insight: the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Norwegian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Victor Norman</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lancaster</ENAMEX> himself, and
yours truly; and the "new trade theory" was born. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A few years later</TIMEX> economists
such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Romer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philippe Aghion</ENAMEX> applied related ideas to technological
change and economic growth, giving birth to the "new growth theory"; and the
ripples spread ever outward.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alas</ENAMEX>, golden ages do end. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1990s</TIMEX>, the
thrill of increasing-returns economics was fading. It wasn't just the
inexorable working of the law of diminishing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">disciples</ENAMEX>. There was a deeper
problem: The new ideas were immensely liberating, but at some point you can get
too liberated. In international trade, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> started to joke that a
smart graduate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> could come up with a model to justify any policy;
similar sentiments were felt in many <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">fields</ENAMEX>. In short, we all got tired of
clever analyses of what might happen; and throughout economics there was a
shift in focus away from theorizing, toward data collection and careful
statistical analysis.

            But it was a golden age--a time of
innovation and intellectual excitement, when all of economics seemed up for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reinvention</ENAMEX>--and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kelvin Lancaster</ENAMEX> was one of those who made it so. Let us honor
his memory.
