            Once again, 
                  Slate
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> are
attacking our book even though they haven't read it. The book, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow</ENAMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36,000</NUMEX> , which will be out in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early September</TIMEX>, explains the reasons for the
stock market's rise <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between August 1982</TIMEX>, when the Dow Jones industrial average
stood at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">777</NUMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, when it's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 10,000</NUMEX>. During <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">nearly this entire</TIMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ascent</ENAMEX>, financial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalists</ENAMEX>, academic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX>, and Wall Street <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX>
have claimed the market was heading for a fall. After all, just look at
price-to-earnings ratios and other measurements of valuation, goes the
conventional wisdom. They're too high!

            What my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">co-author</ENAMEX>--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kevin Hassett</ENAMEX>, a former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reserve</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> whose work has been widely published in scholarly
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">journals</ENAMEX>--and I offer in our book is a new model for pricing stocks, one that
is consistent with the market's performance and with the basic principles of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">finance</ENAMEX>. Our starting point is that the value of a stock, like that of any
other asset (a rental <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">condo</ENAMEX>, a bond), is determined by the amount of cash it
puts into your pockets over time. With stocks, that amount has been
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sky-high</ENAMEX>--and will continue to be, we believe, until shares are bid up by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> to where they should be. That proper level is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 36,000</NUMEX> on the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow</ENAMEX>.

            This argument is laid out at length in an annotated
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX>-page book, which also includes extensive advice on how to implement an
investing strategy based on the theory.

            In 
                  Slate
                on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 9</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">"</ENAMEX>"), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Krugman</ENAMEX>
rehashed the criticisms made in 
                  Slate
                by and before him. Our
response to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Krugman</ENAMEX> is the same as our response to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gottlieb</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Crook</ENAMEX>: You're
accusing us of making an assertion we don't make.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krugman</ENAMEX> wrote that our theory is based "on a simple
misunderstanding of corporate accounting"--that "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX> can eat their seed
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">corn</ENAMEX> and plant it too." What he means is that, while we rely on the growth in
cash flowing to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> as justification for higher stock prices, that cash
is needed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporations</ENAMEX> themselves. In other words, we "double-count"
by using reported corporate earnings for our calculations. But we don't.
Nowhere in the book do we claim that free cash flow is equal to earnings. In
fact, we say that it would be an "egregious error" to make such a statement or
to use it in calculations of stock values. Instead, what we have written from
our <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 1998</TIMEX> piece in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> to our book--and
have repeated, without provoking objection, at academic conferences from
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Princeton</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX>--is that the measure of cash is somewhere between the lower
bound of dividends and the upper bound of earnings. In the book, we discuss
simple ways to determine cash flow as a percentage of earnings. (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Hint: The</ENAMEX>
answer is far from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100 percent</NUMEX>.)

            The thrust of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Krugman</ENAMEX>'s piece is the irony that
stocks have kept rising, just as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glassman</ENAMEX> predicted, so that "the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> who had
no idea what he was talking about gave what turned out to be good advice." This
twisted argument--that we are right in practice but wrong in theory--has become
the last refuge of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who simply do not understand what has been happening
in the stock market over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past two decades</TIMEX> and who cling to an old paradigm
that recent history has clearly repudiated.

            We have written a
serious book--one that will launch a debate over discovering a new and useful
model for determining the true value of stocks. But see for yourself. Don't
read premature reviews of a book that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reviewers</ENAMEX> haven't read. Just hang on.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Timothy Noah</ENAMEX> writes in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chatterbox</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">"</ENAMEX>") that the
fuss over the poisoning deaths of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">800,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> at a cost of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$15 million</NUMEX> in
taxpayer funds in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Environmental Protection Agency</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chemical</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manufacturers Association</ENAMEX> high production volume (HPV) chemical testing program
is about "a whole lot of nothing." Every national animal protection
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>--representing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 10 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>, and
all of which have asked <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Gore</ENAMEX> to re-examine the program--would
beg to differ.

            So might the environmental, consumer, and public
interest group <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX>'s food quality advisory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> who recently
resigned in protest, stating that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> "dithered in endless, fruitless
debate" rather than "doing anything about toxic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemicals</ENAMEX> that have been around
since <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX>" (the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28, 1999</TIMEX>). So might any
number of public policy right-to-know <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> for whom the design and
goals of the HPV program are "obscure" ( <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Right-to-Know News</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Jan. 8</TIMEX>,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>).

            What they would tell <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noah</ENAMEX> is this: The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> has the
knowledge and the ability right now to prioritize the high production
volume chemicals and protect us from the most hazardous ones. But the agency
has launched unthinkingly into this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s most massive animal testing
program, rather than make the effort to collect the substantial amount of
existing data on these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemicals</ENAMEX>, centralize it, and make it accessible.

            Spurred on by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX>'s
rushed schedule for the testing program, even <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> admit they are not
able to develop a scientifically defensible testing strategy. According to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">whistleblower</ENAMEX> calls <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PETA</ENAMEX> has received from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>, the HPV program is
taking much needed resources from important, effective (and authorized) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX>
programs. In fact, after all the money is spent and all the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> have been
killed, what the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX>, the environment, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> will be left with is:
a whole lot of nothing .

               Over and Under the
Line in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oregon</ENAMEX>
            

            Almost everyone misunderstands the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oregon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Health</ENAMEX>
Plan, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cyrus Sanai</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">"</ENAMEX>") is no exception.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oregon</ENAMEX> led the way with an attempt at
explicit rationing--treating only the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> that were most likely
to benefit from treatment and increasing the coverage as money allowed. Most
everyone else in the world rations implicitly through a process known
as "queuing" in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX> by progressively increasing the length of time needed
to obtain services until the least hardy either get better, get discouraged, or
die. It is debatable which is the better procedure; it is not
debatable that resources are limited, that some form of rationing is
inevitable, and that virtually every scheme for financing medical care has run
aground on the shoals of excess demand in an ocean of insufficient
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> actually do get treatment for many of the
"noncovered services" in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oregon</ENAMEX>, and specifically, they get treated for anal
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fissures</ENAMEX>. It's just that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> usually doesn't get paid for treating them.
Many "below the line" procedures actually are covered on a case-by-case basis,
but it depends on the insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>'s policy (there are many private
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> administering the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oregon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Health Plan</ENAMEX>).

            To my knowledge, there has been little or no
movement of "the line" since the scheme was first written down. The federal
government has been very reluctant to grant the necessary waivers to allow the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oregon</ENAMEX> experiment to operate that way, so in reality, the number of diseases
covered has not changed very much. But the eligibility requirements change with
changing resource levels so that more or fewer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are covered by the plan
depending on how much money is available. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> pretty much expect to be taken
care of no matter what is wrong with them, and once they get their "insurance"
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">card</ENAMEX> the hemorrhoid sufferers generally will not defer to congestive heart
failure, for example, so the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oregon</ENAMEX> plan has a fatal flaw; the most basic flaw
of all--human nature.

            Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are uncomfortable with the idea of a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tax-supported</ENAMEX> planned suicide--but it is, among other things, an unintended
consequence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Americans with Disabilities Act</ENAMEX>. How can a publicly funded
program discriminate against <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> with disabilities? If it is legal, then
the law requires that it be funded. For what it is worth, there has been no
rush to exterminate a lot of unwanted <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oregon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Health Plan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX>. For <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one</TIMEX>
thing, there is something called <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Tort Law</ENAMEX> (malpractice) that discourages even
the most dyed-in-the-wool <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supporters</ENAMEX> of "death with dignity" from actually
prescribing any suicide <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocktail</ENAMEX>.

replies: <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Duncan</ENAMEX> is correct that the HMOs administering the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oregon</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Health Plan</ENAMEX> may elect to cover conditions below the funding line, and no doubt
many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> do treat such conditions at no charge or by combining treatment
with a condition falling above the line. But they don't have to provide such
treatment under the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Oregon</ENAMEX> system; that's the whole point of having the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prioritization</ENAMEX> list.
            

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Duncan</ENAMEX>'s information on the status Medicaid
demonstration waiver is outdated; the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oregon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Health Plan</ENAMEX> received its Section
1115a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicaid</ENAMEX> demonstration waiver from the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX> after
being required to reorder the prioritization list.
            

            
               The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> with
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Disabilities Act</ENAMEX> has a lot of strange things to answer for, but publicly
supported assisted suicide is not one of them. After the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Death with Dignity Act</ENAMEX>
survived a repeal attempt and court challenges, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oregon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX>'s office
concluded (correctly, I think) that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX>-assisted suicide was a medical
procedure eligible for inclusion in the prioritization list. However, it was
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">commission</ENAMEX> that decided that the "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Rx of No Return</ENAMEX>" merited position 263.
That there has not been a rush to fill these prescriptions, let alone publicize
the availability of this option, does not lessen the significance of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oregon</ENAMEX>'s
move as the logical intersection of health-care rationing and assisted
suicide.

            In general I agree with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eric Scigliano</ENAMEX>'s "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Letter</ENAMEX>
From <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>" (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">"</ENAMEX>") on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dale Chihuly</ENAMEX>; however, I think he's being unfair in a
few places.

            First, I think he makes far too big a deal over the
fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chihuly</ENAMEX> doesn't blow his own <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glass</ENAMEX>. Many sculptors run workshop
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">studios</ENAMEX> where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assistants</ENAMEX> do the actual casting and assembling of the large
works. I'm not sure how many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Burghers of Calais</ENAMEX> were actually
cast by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rodin</ENAMEX>, and I don't think it particularly affects how I should regard
the statues. If <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scigliano</ENAMEX> thinks that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chihuly</ENAMEX>'s real crime is to imply that he
still blows glass, then he should say so directly.

            I'm also not sure it's
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fair</ENAMEX> to lay all of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest</ENAMEX>'s sins at <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">the feet</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amazon.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">com,</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Starbucks</ENAMEX>. While making his case that the nouveau riche are responsible for
Chihuly-mania, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scigliano</ENAMEX> also cites <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tacoma</ENAMEX> as ground-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> for the phenomenon.
Last time I checked, there weren't too many stock-option <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">millionaires</ENAMEX> living in
