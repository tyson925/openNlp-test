               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Randy</ENAMEX>'s
Wrap-Up
            

            Unlike a modern
corporate logo designed by professional graphics <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, where minimalism and
self-justifying folderol are key, a government seal ought to embody clutter and
boneheaded symbolism. The seal of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Republic</ENAMEX>'s home <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Missouri</ENAMEX> is perfect.
It's got bears! <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> of them, standing up (rampant). The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">1960 World Book</ENAMEX>
says that means <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Missouri</ENAMEX> supports itself and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, although it
looks more like a poster for animal boxing, which might be the state sport of
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Missouri</ENAMEX>. (Formerly the state sport was catching and returning runaway <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">slaves</ENAMEX>.)
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bears</ENAMEX> are holding up what might be a dinner plate that says, "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United We</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stand Divided We Ball</ENAMEX>," indicating a surprisingly open marriage or that the ink
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">smeared</ENAMEX>. In the middle of the dinner plate (or is it a base drum?) there is a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">crescent moon</ENAMEX> (or a set of cattle horns, symbolic of a self-deluding <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cow</ENAMEX> who
thinks she could beat a bear in a fair fight, but I don't like her chances).
Below the moon (or cow) is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sheep</ENAMEX> (or dog) who also seems ready to rumble, and
to the right of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sheep</ENAMEX> (or dog) is an eagle with a cloud above its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX>, or
maybe a cartoon balloon showing what the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eagle</ENAMEX> is thinking (it's tough to make
out), probably something very funny, indicating that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eagle</ENAMEX> hopes to get its
own comic strip <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">some day</TIMEX>. Also shown are a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stars</ENAMEX>--<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 or 25</NUMEX>, one of them
could be a dust speck--symbolizing something to do with the sky or <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> time
or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">celebrities</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">spaceships</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">celebrities</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">spaceships</ENAMEX> like in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Star</ENAMEX>
Wars . There are a helmet and some ferns or laurel, some kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">leaves</ENAMEX>, and
a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> motto, "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salus Populi Suprema Lex Esto</ENAMEX>," which, if I remember my <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Latin</ENAMEX>,
means "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Best People in This State Don't Have To Obey the Traffic Laws</ENAMEX>."
That's a lot more than you get out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nike</ENAMEX> swoosh. Or swish.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Russell Clark</ENAMEX> gave the town <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30 days</TIMEX> to
eliminate the "<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>" that adorns the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8-year-old</TIMEX> city seal, as well as
its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trucks</ENAMEX>, flags, street signs, and stationery. He noted that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> "is
exhibited extensively throughout southwest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Missouri</ENAMEX> to denote <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX>-owned
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX>."

            The case was brought by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACLU</ENAMEX> on behalf of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jean</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Webb</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wiccan</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> was represented pro bono by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Legal</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Foundation</ENAMEX>, a "<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> public interest law <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX>."
