            Actually, the article fails to include one critical
fact: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zack Exley</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> parody site was not set up to express opinions--or even
to parody <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Exley</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cybersquatter</ENAMEX> who demanded <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$20K</NUMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>
campaign for the rights to the domain name. When they refused, he set up an
anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> site. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> even claims to be non-partisan. This is just a case of
electronic blackmail that the media <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blowhards</ENAMEX> want to turn into a free-speech
case.

            Personally, I think the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> camp is acting like
brats that didn't get everything they wanted at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX>. As I'm sure y'all
know, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> campaign purposely combatted the possibility of competing with
mock spoof sites like gwbush.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX> by BUYING domain names (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 60</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX>, from what I got
from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek</ENAMEX> article). Some examples (and go ahead and try them):
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">georgebushbites</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">com, www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">georgebushblows</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX>, georgebushsucks.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">com,</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bushbites</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">com, www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bushsux</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">com</ENAMEX>. All these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> will
automatically lead into <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Dubbawya</ENAMEX>'s Web site (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">georgewbush</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">com</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neat</ENAMEX>, huh?

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GWBush</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX> and another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zack Exley</ENAMEX> site squeaked by
this, and since the campaign couldn't buy it, they decided to get rid of it.
Funny, I thought that politics and campaigning were about freedom of speech and
the ability to compete. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">campaign</ENAMEX> has a sweet monopoly on that.

            If you would like more information, you should go
to the site that is actually handling this case: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rtmark</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">com</ENAMEX>. It has everything from the cease
and desist letter to any articles remote to the subject.

            How ingenious of 
                  Slate
                to
publish a sales pitch under the guise of analysis. This column is tantamount to
having an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX> account exec go on <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">World News Tonight</ENAMEX> to deliver a special
report on why <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Drew Carey</ENAMEX> gives you more bang for your media buck.

            The impact of the Web on the campaign is a worthy
topic, but a little more objectivity, please.

            Your comments about weather hysteria were generally
right on, but I felt your comments about the role of the Web in promoting that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hysteria</ENAMEX> missed the point. Access to weather information on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Web</ENAMEX> is a giant
leap forward in weather media because it allows <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to avoid the hype and
hysteria with which the general news media covers extreme weather. Check out
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">wunderground</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">com</ENAMEX>. The
information is straightforward, but interestingly displayed. I could track
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Floyd</ENAMEX>, read Weather Service bulletins, and follow satellite images without
having to suffer through moronic anchor-blondes screaming into microphones over
the sound of the wind. Weather sites on the Web eliminate the media <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">middleman</ENAMEX>,
and isn't that the point?

            A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conservative</ENAMEX> shows genuine compassion and he gets
called a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wimp</ENAMEX>!? Maybe he should have called a news conference and told the
wounded to "put some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> on it." Here's a news flash: <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Conservatives</ENAMEX> are human
too. They have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wives</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pets</ENAMEX>; they love and make love, have gardens, go
to church and make <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>.
