            They are ardent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">environmentalists</ENAMEX>. They adore
technology and understand it as no <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> before them did. They practically
invented the Internet. They don't vote: They distrust politics and prefer
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">voluntarism</ENAMEX>. They're skeptical of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporations</ENAMEX> and impervious to traditional
advertising. They're less racist and more multiracial than any group of
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> in history.

            They are, of course, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Generation Y</ENAMEX>, as trend-mongers
describe them <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>. But they are also Generation <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX>, as trend-mongers described
them <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six years ago</TIMEX>. And no doubt they are <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Generation Z</ENAMEX>, as trend-mongers will
describe them in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2015</TIMEX>. Generalizing about a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> is always bogus,
especially when most of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> aren't out of short pants yet. But no
matter. Fifty-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gen Xers</ENAMEX>, once hailed for their iconoclasm, have
been discarded as "cynical" and "sour." Supplanting them are the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">77 million</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sunny children</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gen Y.</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Generation Y</ENAMEX>--a ridiculous --includes those born
since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1981</TIMEX>.) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gen Xers</ENAMEX> were in their <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">20s</NUMEX> when they became media darlings. The
oldest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gen Y</ENAMEX> have just entered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">college</ENAMEX>, which means that for the
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time since the baby boom, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> is obsessed with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teen-agers</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Teens</ENAMEX> (and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25-year-olds</TIMEX>
masquerading as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teens</ENAMEX>) have kidnapped pop culture. Their movies--from
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Titanic to Scream to Cruel Intentions</ENAMEX> --have swallowed
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">multiplexes</ENAMEX>. Their melodramas own the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> and have turned their
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nymphs</ENAMEX>-- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dawson</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Creek</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Katie Holmes</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Party of Five</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jennifer</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Love Hewitt, Felicity</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keri Russell</ENAMEX>--into <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">superstars</ENAMEX>. Their music
rules, from <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Kid Rock to Eminem to Backstreet Boys</ENAMEX>. Even <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> have been
bewitched by the teen invasion. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times Magazine</ENAMEX> is fretting
about teen-age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX>' body image problems. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. News</ENAMEX> just ran a cover
story on "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Teen Brain</ENAMEX>." (Why are your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teen-agers sullen</ENAMEX> and irrational?
Because the parts of the brain that develop last are those that regulate
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">judgment</ENAMEX> and emotion. Also because they hate you.)

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> is global HQ for teendom, but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Americans</ENAMEX>
have not always fixated on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teens</ENAMEX> or even been aware of them. As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Hine</ENAMEX>
reports in his new book, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Rise and Fall of the American Teenager</ENAMEX> , the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">teen</ENAMEX> was invented in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 20 th century</TIMEX>. For most of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> history,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">adolescents</ENAMEX> (also a modern creation) inhabited the adult world as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">laborers</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apprentices</ENAMEX>. No one claimed that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teens</ENAMEX> were incapacitated by raging <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormones</ENAMEX> or
needed an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eight-year</TIMEX> respite to find themselves. The <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Great Depression</ENAMEX> minted
the American teen by exiling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> from the labor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> to high <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>. Only
after <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX> did high school become the universal, defining experience of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youth</ENAMEX>. For the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adolescents</ENAMEX> were artificially segregated from
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>, and developed their own culture of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX>, dating, and rock 'n' roll.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> was fascinated by teen-age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boomers</ENAMEX> not only because there were so many
of them, but also because they were so alien: The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> had never seen
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teen-agers</ENAMEX> before.

            We, however, have seen
and been <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teen-agers</ENAMEX>. So what explains our tyromania? <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Demography</ENAMEX> is part of it.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Generation Y</ENAMEX> is huge, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 percent</NUMEX> larger than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Generation X.</ENAMEX> By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2010</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35 million</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teen-agers</ENAMEX> will haunt <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">malls</ENAMEX> and chat <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX>, more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teens</ENAMEX> than there ever were
during the baby boom. The media cycle has also boosted <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Generation Y.</ENAMEX>
Trend-spotters need trends. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Yuppies</ENAMEX> were the stereotype of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the '80s</TIMEX>. The bleak
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early '90s</TIMEX> were defined by the allegedly darker and less materialistic Gen
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xers</ENAMEX>. Now the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> need a new plot line, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gen Y</ENAMEX> is providing it.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Generation Y</ENAMEX> is also booming because it is a cheerful story
for a cheerful age. Just as the slump of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the '90s</TIMEX> has been replaced by the
eternal boom, the cynical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pessimists</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Gen X</ENAMEX> have been vanquished by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cheery Ys</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the '80s</TIMEX>, writing about <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teen-agers</ENAMEX> meant writing about rising
pregnancy rates, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> use, and crime. Today, teen pregnancy, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> use, crime,
dropout rates, and sexual activity are down. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Church-going</ENAMEX> is up. Racism is out.
The "<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Earnestness</ENAMEX>" and the "<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Familism</ENAMEX>" are in. Rebellion is pass√©. At
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commentators</ENAMEX> gloat, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> are having real childhoods again. The school
massacres in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Littleton</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colo.</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jonesboro</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ark.</ENAMEX>, have barely soured the
mood. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> have focused on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>' passionate, unified response to the
killings.

            This incessant cheer is
inspiring inane predictions about what magnificent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gen Yers</ENAMEX> will
be. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Commentators</ENAMEX> opine that their childhood prosperity will make them generous
and idealistic. According to polls, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teens</ENAMEX> are optimistic. Pop <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prophets</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Strauss</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neil Howe</ENAMEX> call them a "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Hero</ENAMEX>" <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX>. But young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>,
especially <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teens</ENAMEX>, have always registered optimism. Even <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gen Xers</ENAMEX> were
optimistic when they were polled <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five years ago</TIMEX>. Of course <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gen Yers</ENAMEX> are peppy
now: Who wouldn't be? Let's see what they say when the economy dives the year
they graduate from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">college</ENAMEX>. And let's wait until most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gen Yers</ENAMEX> are capable of
rational thought. Most of them haven't reached puberty yet, and many are in
diapers.

            The most important reason for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s tyromania is
economic. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> seems obsessed with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youth</ENAMEX> because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporations</ENAMEX> are obsessed
with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youth</ENAMEX>: If they catch <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> early enough, they can cement their brand
preferences for life. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Networks</ENAMEX> are producing teen dramas so that their
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">advertisers</ENAMEX> can reach this impressionable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX>. Movies are pitched to
teen-age sensibilities because only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teen-agers</ENAMEX> go to movies again and again and
again. As far as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">marketers</ENAMEX> are concerned, <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Gen X</ENAMEX> is over: It has aged out of the
consumption game. But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Generation Y</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> are up for grabs: They are young, they
have monstrous amounts of cash to spend--the average teen has <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$94</NUMEX> a week of
disposable income!--and they'll be even richer when they grow up.

            It's unsurprising, therefore, that the people
pushing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gen Y</ENAMEX> boom hardest are not <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sociologists</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalists</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activists</ENAMEX>
but market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX>. The most quoted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gen Y</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pundits</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX> who work at
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Youth Information Network</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Teenage Research Unlimited</ENAMEX>,
which collect data on trendy brands. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TRU</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford Foundation</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gen Y</ENAMEX>
analysis.) Stories about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gen Y</ENAMEX> tend to shortchange <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>' views on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>,
school, and politics, and dwell instead on their favorite clothing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX>.

            (To cynical <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gen Xers</ENAMEX> such
as myself, this marketing talk seems both contradictory and fatuous. The market
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> instruct that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gen Yers</ENAMEX> are brand-conscious yet skeptical of
established brands, independent-minded yet conformist. They say things like
"This is the coolest generation ever." If you can use "viral marketing" and
"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Abercrombie & Fitch</ENAMEX>" in the same sentence, you too can be a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gen Y</ENAMEX> pundit.
Then again, if you could use "grunge" and "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> reform" in the same
sentence, you could have been a <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Gen X</ENAMEX> pundit.)

            The final reason for the teen renaissance is boomer
self-obsession. A pervasive theme of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Generation Y</ENAMEX> is that it is growing up just
as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boomers</ENAMEX> did: prosperous, happy, well-adjusted. If you consume teen
culture at all, you have surely noticed the remarkable number of sympathetic
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> around. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX>'s TV <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> are wisdom figures, not the adult buffoons
we have grown accustomed to. Similarly, articles about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gen Y</ENAMEX>--many written by
boomer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>--are fulsome about how well <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boomers</ENAMEX> are raising their tots, how
intimately <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> communicate, and how much <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> admire mom and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX>.
The "surprising fact" that pops up in almost every <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gen Y</ENAMEX> story is a survey in
which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teens</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> as their favorite role models. (I would bet that
every survey of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teens</ENAMEX> taken since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cain</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abel</ENAMEX> found that they named parents
as their favorite role models.)

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Boomers</ENAMEX>, whose self-absorption has long been
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ridiculed</ENAMEX>, have finally managed to get over themselves. They have found a new
object of their affection. They don't need self-love anymore. They've got
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Mini-Me</ENAMEX>.
