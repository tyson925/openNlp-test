               According to the
Times of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX>, around the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX>, something will happen on
Long <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Island</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> believe has a small but genuine chance of causing
"perturbations of the universe," which could destroy the world. What will
happen? ( Question courtesy of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jennifer Miller</ENAMEX>. )

               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Randy</ENAMEX>'s Wrap-Up
            

            There was much grumbling
in the ranks about this question but, if imperfect, it does rest on a solid
theoretical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">foundation</ENAMEX>. Odd <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">juxtapositions</ENAMEX> can produce comic results or former
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> who now stand among the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX>. Squirrels are funny. Indeed,
many small and furry <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> tend to be funny and, if you squint, resemble
genitalia taken disturbingly out of context and scampering about the place. The
ultra-orthodox tend to be funny, particularly when they wear unusual hats and
when they're not pelting you with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stones</ENAMEX>. A small, furry, ultra-observant
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dutchman</ENAMEX> in a big black hat is funny if he's not <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Stuyvesant</ENAMEX>, who, were he
alive <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, would probably stick with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Republican Party</ENAMEX>, but could perhaps
become funny if a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> squirrel bit him on the ass. At least that was the
theory. But with these things, you never know.

Away at So-Called "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Raves" Answer</ENAMEX>
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> drug <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX> enlisted young <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hasidic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>
flying from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> to smuggle <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MDMA</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ecstasy</ENAMEX>), a drug shown to cause
brain damage in squirrels.

            Those arrested were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> and New
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">York</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israeli</ENAMEX> is still a fugitive. No <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">courier</ENAMEX> has yet been arrested.

            Each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hasid</ENAMEX>--most of those involved are from
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Williamsburg</ENAMEX>--was given a plane ticket and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">around $1,500</NUMEX> to carry <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to 45,000</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tablets</ENAMEX>. Best excuse from a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hasidic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">courier</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Drugs</ENAMEX>?! We thought we were
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">smuggling diamonds</ENAMEX>! (I swear.)

            Each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">squirrel</ENAMEX>--the
research was conducted at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Johns Hopkins</ENAMEX>--may have shown that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MDMA</ENAMEX> damages parts
of the brain critical for thought and memory, many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>'s favorite parts.
This work is presumably as definitive as the LSD chromosome damage studies much
published in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Life</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1967 and 1968</TIMEX>. No squirrel has yet been
arrested.
