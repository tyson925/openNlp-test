            When I wrote my first textbook, the publisher
wanted to combat <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the second-semester</TIMEX> used book market by sewing a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$100</NUMEX> bill
into the binding of every <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">100 th</NUMEX> book. Every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> would tear his
book apart to see if he'd won. Printing with disappearing ink that lasts
exactly <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">semester</TIMEX> would also discourage the used book market. But instead of
running lotteries or using disappearing ink, most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publishers</ENAMEX> make used
textbooks obsolete by periodically releasing revised editions. Did I mention
that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fifth</TIMEX> edition of my textbook is forthcoming <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</TIMEX>?

            The naive answer to why <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publishers</ENAMEX> might want to
discourage the used book market is that they prefer to get paid every time a
student buys a book. But by that logic, you should never sell your <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> when
you can rent it: Why get paid only once when you could get paid <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every month</TIMEX>?
The logic is wrong because the sale price is likely to be far higher than the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</TIMEX> rent. And the logic is still wrong when applied to textbooks, because
the sale price for a book that can be resold is likely to be far higher than
the price of a book designed to lose its value.

            If a student is willing to pay, say, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$30</NUMEX> for a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">textbook</ENAMEX>, that same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> will be willing to pay <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$60</NUMEX> for the use of a
textbook that can be resold for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$30</NUMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the semester</TIMEX>. (For the sake
of simplicity, let's ignore the fact that the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$30</NUMEX> delivered <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few months</TIMEX> from
now is worth a little less than <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$30</NUMEX> delivered immediately.) And for a book that
can be resold twice, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">owner</ENAMEX>'s willingness to pay <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$60</NUMEX> means that the
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owner</ENAMEX> is willing to pay <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$90</NUMEX>.

            Now, if you're a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">publisher</ENAMEX>, is it more attractive to collect <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$30</NUMEX> apiece for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> books printed
with disappearing ink or to collect <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$90</NUMEX> for one book that's designed to last?
As long as it's cheaper to produce <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> book than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publisher</ENAMEX> should
opt for permanence.

            That's why <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> are generally skeptical about
allegations of "planned obsolescence." <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Every few years</TIMEX>, someone claims that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Electric</ENAMEX> knows how to make a light bulb <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last 1,000 years</TIMEX> but suppresses
the technology to keep us coming back for more light bulbs. Likewise, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ann</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Landers</ENAMEX> is forever publishing columns about how pantyhose are intentionally
designed to run so <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> will need a new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every two weeks</TIMEX>.

            But a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> who buys a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2</NUMEX>
pair of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pantyhose</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every two weeks</TIMEX> has demonstrated her willingness to spend <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$52</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> on pantyhose. If <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hanes</ENAMEX> could make a pair that's guaranteed to last a
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>, she'd buy it for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$52</NUMEX>. That would be a better proposition for Hanes
than having to make <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX> pairs to collect the same revenue. So the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ann Landers</ENAMEX>
theory makes no sense.

            Does that mean there's no such thing as planned
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">obsolescence</ENAMEX>? No, it means that planned obsolescence occurs only under special
conditions. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mistrust</ENAMEX>, for example, is a special condition. If a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">publisher</ENAMEX> says,
"Buy this book for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$90</NUMEX>, and you'll be able to resell it <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</TIMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$60</NUMEX>," a
student might well respond, "How do I know you won't bring out a new edition
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</TIMEX> and undercut my resale market?" Unless the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publisher</ENAMEX> can quell such
doubts, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> won't pay premium prices for books with lasting value, so
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">publishers</ENAMEX> won't provide them.

            (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Students</ENAMEX>, of course, are in some sense a captive
market, forced to buy the books their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professors</ENAMEX> assign. But there must,
nevertheless, be some upper limit on their willingness to pay; otherwise,
textbooks would sell for an infinite price. And whatever the upper limit is, it
will always be higher for a book that can be resold than for a book that
can't.)

            In most instances of
planned obsolescence, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> have demanded it, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX> have provided it as
a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">service</ENAMEX>. Maybe you'd rather not spend <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$52</NUMEX> on a pair of pantyhose that might
get lost at the laundry. Or maybe you don't have <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$52</NUMEX> in your pocket right now.
By letting you buy <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX> shoddy pairs at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2</NUMEX> apiece, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX> provides you
with the equivalent of either insurance (against the prospect of losing your
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">entire year</TIMEX>'s supply of hose at once) or a loan (by allowing you to spread out
your payments over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">an entire year</TIMEX>).

            What brings all this to mind is the recent controversy over
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monsanto Co.</ENAMEX>'s development of infertile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seeds</ENAMEX>--<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seeds</ENAMEX> that yield <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crops</ENAMEX> that
don't reproduce so that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX> have to buy new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seeds</ENAMEX> each year. From the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">farmer</ENAMEX>'s point of view, the opportunity to buy infertile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seeds</ENAMEX> can be a great
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">boon</ENAMEX>. Instead of paying <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$100</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seed</ENAMEX> that should <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last 10 years</TIMEX>, you pay <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$10</NUMEX>
for new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seed</ENAMEX> each year, which insures you against the possibility of a
disastrous and expensive crop loss.

            (Are you worried that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monsanto</ENAMEX> would charge just as much for the infertile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seeds</ENAMEX> as the fertile ones?
Don't be. Surely <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX> are willing to pay much more for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fertile seeds</ENAMEX> than
for infertile, and you can be sure that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monsanto</ENAMEX> fully exploits that
willingness.)

            Many high-yield hybrid seeds are infertile, though not by
design. Like mules, they're naturally infertile. Taking its lead from the
software industry, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monsanto</ENAMEX> had planned to convert this bug into a feature. But
in the face of considerable public pressure, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monsanto</ENAMEX> has agreed to stop
developing infertile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seeds</ENAMEX>.

            Much of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">opposition</ENAMEX> had nothing to do with
planned obsolescence and everything to do with concern that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monsanto</ENAMEX>'s
infertility gene might "leap" from its <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seeds</ENAMEX> to fertile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seeds</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">adjoining</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">farms</ENAMEX> and eventually render those fertile strains infertile. Such hypothesized
contamination is a legitimate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> and quite plausibly a sufficient reason
to applaud <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monsanto</ENAMEX>'s decision. But an unfortunate side effect is the lost
opportunity to provide some socially desirable planned obsolescence.
