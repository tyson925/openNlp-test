            Stories about <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">W. Bush</ENAMEX> invariably note that he has spent most of his life doing exactly what
his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>, former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George H.W. Bush</ENAMEX>, once did. This is not quite
right. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">W.</ENAMEX> has spent most of his life doing exactly what his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> did, but
doing it worse . He is a chip off the old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">block</ENAMEX>, chipped.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Poppy Bush</ENAMEX> starred at
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Andover</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">W.</ENAMEX> lazed his way through the prep <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> motored through
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yale</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two and a half years</TIMEX>, earning a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phi Beta Kappa</ENAMEX> key along the way. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son squeaked</ENAMEX> through old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eli</ENAMEX>. Poppy, like his own <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prescott Bush</ENAMEX>
before him, captained the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yale</ENAMEX> baseball <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> and joined the secret society
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Skull & Bones</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">W.</ENAMEX> wasn't good enough to play ball for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yale</ENAMEX>. And though he
joined <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Skull & Bones</ENAMEX>, he whiled away his <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">nights</TIMEX> with a much less refined
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX>, the hard-drinking frat <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brothers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DKE</ENAMEX>.

            The elder <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> enlisted in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1942</TIMEX>, became the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">service</ENAMEX>'s youngest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fighter pilot</ENAMEX>, flew <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">58</NUMEX> missions in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Pacific</ENAMEX>, was
shot down over enemy waters, and won the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Distinguished Flying Cross</ENAMEX>. The son
also became a fighter <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilot</ENAMEX>--for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texas Air National Guard</ENAMEX>. He spent the
<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Vietnam War</ENAMEX> flying "missions" over the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> scrub.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">W.</ENAMEX> followed his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>'s path into the oil <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX>.
Both abandoned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New England</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Texas</ENAMEX> to strike it rich. Both relied on
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rich</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> start, but whereas the old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> scored in his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">oilfields</ENAMEX>,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> struggled. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George H.W.</ENAMEX> ran for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> and won. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George W.</ENAMEX> ran for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> and lost. Come middle age, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> threw himself into public
service: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.N.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ambassador</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ambassador</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> threw himself
into <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">baseball</ENAMEX>, as an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texas Rangers</ENAMEX>.

            (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> tend to forget
the heroic life of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>. This was one of his unfortunate talents: He
could make the extraordinary seem mundane.)

            There are competing theories about what the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX>'s pale
imitation of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">résumé signifies</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, popular among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gov.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fans</ENAMEX>, is
that he's a late bloomer. It took him till <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">his mid-40s</TIMEX> to settle down, but now
that he has he is making up for his lost <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> and surpassing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> he has
so long trailed. After all, he has won a statewide race in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> twice. Poppy
lost both his statewide campaigns in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>. Junior has already vanquished
former <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gov.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ann Richards</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> who ridiculed his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX>. Now
he will topple <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Gore</ENAMEX>, half the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> that battered <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dad</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX>. The other,
less charitable, theory surmises that just as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">W.</ENAMEX> has tried to equal his father
and fallen short, so he'll find some way to choke in the presidential
election.

            It's far too early to take sides on this question
or to draw grand psychological conclusions about how the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> will shadow the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">son</ENAMEX>'s presidential campaign. But there is another way to look at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">W.</ENAMEX>'s knockoff
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">résumé</ENAMEX>: as a documentary of a generational change in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> politics.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brookings Institution</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">scholar Stephen Hess</ENAMEX>, author of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">America's Political Dynasties</ENAMEX> , notes
that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> political dynasties come in all sizes and flavors. In some, a
family from humble origins uses political success to make itself rich and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">snooty</ENAMEX>. In some, a dynasty is stolidly consistent across <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX>. The Tafts
of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX>, for instance, have been steady <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> burghers for more than a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">century</ENAMEX>.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">Bushes</ENAMEX> started as a noblesse oblige dynasty. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prescott</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> began his (forgettable) service as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senator</ENAMEX> only after a long career as a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gentleman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">banker</ENAMEX>. He viewed his political activity as an obligation, and he
instilled that sentiment in his son <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George</ENAMEX>. Poppy was dutiful in pursuit of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>, compiling the requisite experience almost mechanically, adding line
after line to his résumé until <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> had no choice but to elect him
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>. Politics was always a duty, never a pleasure. (Remember the horror
of hearing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Bush</ENAMEX> ingratiating himself with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> by calling them "my
main <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>" and the like?)

            But what began as
noblesse oblige has morphed into something different during this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">Bushes</ENAMEX> are a microcosm of the transformation of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> politics from
Northeastern elitism to Western populism. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX>'s failure to match his father
reflects this small-D democratization. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> the elder came of age when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">England</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> led the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX>, and patrician manners were boons to a
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX>. But in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">an era</TIMEX> when a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politician</ENAMEX>'s ability to communicate trumps
anything else and the balance of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> power has shifted west, the preppy,
Anglican ethos that defined the old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> is suspect. (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George W. Bush</ENAMEX> spent his
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1978</TIMEX> congressional campaign excusing his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>'s membership in the Trilateral
Commission.) In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s politics, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX>'s checkered <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">résumé</ENAMEX> signifies success.
By choosing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DKE</ENAMEX> over <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Skull & Bones</ENAMEX>, drinking over studying, baseball over
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Nations</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George W.</ENAMEX> compiled a record that suits our populist
age.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">W.</ENAMEX> has bartered the high-status accomplishments of his
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> for something more precious: regular guyness. He is warm and impulsive
where his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> was distant and calculating. Every story about the son
applauds his democratic instincts, his ease with all kinds of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, his
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ebullience</ENAMEX> and physicality, his informality. His passionate <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Methodism</ENAMEX> contrasts
with his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ancestors</ENAMEX>' chilly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Episcopalianism</ENAMEX>.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> dynasty, oddly, has followed the opposite
path. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Gore Jr.</ENAMEX> has outdone his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senator father</ENAMEX> in the calculus of political
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">achievement</ENAMEX>, but the veep is stiff and awkward and dutiful in a way that his
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">impulsive</ENAMEX>, backslappy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> never was. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George W. Bush</ENAMEX> jokes that his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>'s
idea of a perfect <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Gore Jr.</ENAMEX> This may be <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>'s choice in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>: the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George W. Bush</ENAMEX> who isn't <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George H.W. Bush</ENAMEX>, or the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Gore</ENAMEX> who is.
