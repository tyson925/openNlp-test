            We tried to hold off--honest we did. As a service
to civic sanity, 
                  Slate
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">earnestly</ENAMEX> intended to delay launching our
heavy election-year political coverage until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November 1999</TIMEX>. That would be a
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">full year</TIMEX> before the election, which ought to be enough time for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> to
read <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10-to-20</NUMEX> books on current issues, study the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platforms</ENAMEX>, listen
to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half a dozen</NUMEX> debates, and make the kind of thoughtful decision our Founding
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Fathers</ENAMEX> intended. Certainly no <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizen</ENAMEX> outside the media-political complex has
been complaining that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> of presidential politics is not enough.

            But we give in. The
presidential campaign is going full-throttle and the nomination races, at
least, might well be over by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> before the actual election. Others in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">media</ENAMEX> are covering the election as if it were a mere, say, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11 months</TIMEX> away. So
we will too, starting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</TIMEX>. (And if others in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> went and jumped
off a cliff, would we do it too? Yes, probably.) Although blame for this
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX> is ordinarily pinned on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">greedy</ENAMEX> for
attention, that have front-end-loaded the primary system, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> themselves
are also to blame, along with political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultants</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pollsters</ENAMEX>, and so on, all
of whom have a vested interest in the "permanent campaign" (a concept used in a
book title, if not actually invented, by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sidney Blumenthal</ENAMEX>, but not necessarily
invalid for that reason alone). Thanks to the election industry, politics are
now available year-round, like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">strawberries</ENAMEX>. And if you remember politics
tasting sweeter before it got industrialized, that's probably just your
imagination.

            Our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">correspondent</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacob Weisberg</ENAMEX>, has
spent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past year</TIMEX> writing cultural criticism under the rubric "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Browser</ENAMEX>."
He was hoping to spend <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few more months</TIMEX> gazing at paintings and reading novels
before lowering his sights, but now he has loyally abandoned art for life.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacob</ENAMEX> is already filing political analysis and reportage several times a week
under the rubric "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Ballot Box"</ENAMEX> (the latest addition to our collection of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boxes</ENAMEX>).
If you missed his amusing dispatches from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Iowa Straw</ENAMEX> Poll this past
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">weekend</ENAMEX>, it's .

            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Early next week</TIMEX>, we'll be launching "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>"
(catchy, don'cha think?), our official 
                  Slate
                election page. Among
its offerings will be:

            

               Links and an opinionated guide to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX>'s best political stories on the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Web</ENAMEX>.

               Links and shameless touting for all 
                     Slate
                  's current political
stories (whether they're the best or not).

               A <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> joke, crafted by the finest humor artisans from the freshest
material available.

               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark Alan Stamaty</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekly</TIMEX> animated cartoon.

               Our daily chart of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> prices in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iowa Electronic Market</ENAMEX>, graphed
against 
                     Slate
                  's own Pundits Index. Not to be confused with last
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">weekend</ENAMEX>'s bogus straw poll, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iowa Market</ENAMEX> (a product of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iowa</ENAMEX> business <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>) trades "stock" in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX>. It's slightly complicated
(click here
for an explanation), but the point is to see if the invisible hand of
capitalism can beat the gasbags at predicting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">election</TIMEX> results.

               Links galore to the campaign Web sites, media, and other useful stuff for
politics <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">junkies</ENAMEX>.

            

            Shortly after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Labor Day</TIMEX>,
we'll be launching a new column, "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Net Election</ENAMEX>," published by

                  Slate
                in conjunction with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Industry Standard</ENAMEX> , "the
newsmagazine of the Internet economy." 
                  Slate
                will supply a weekly
political analysis of the election as it's playing out on the Web, and our
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Industry Standard</ENAMEX> will supply a weekly business
analysis--who's buying ads on what <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX>, and so on. By common consent, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>
will be the Internet's <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> grown-up election: the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Web</ENAMEX> and
e-mail are expected to play a serious role. So maybe it's OK by us after all
that the whole thing is starting so early.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frayed Nerves</ENAMEX>
            

            "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Fray</ENAMEX>," 
                  Slate
               's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> discussion
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">forum</ENAMEX>, has been transformed, effective <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</TIMEX>: new technology, new user
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interface</ENAMEX>, new rules of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>. Our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> send us piles of clever and
insightful e-mail messages, responding to what they read in

                  Slate
               . Part of our purpose in redesigning <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Fray</ENAMEX> is to get more
of this brilliance out where it can be shared with other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> and possibly
incite an even more brilliant response. To that end, we have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) made <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Fray</ENAMEX>
free of charge and available to all 
                  Slate
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) created
discussion threads related to specific 
                  Slate
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">departments</ENAMEX> and
articles rather than general topics; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) provided links at the end of each
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">article</ENAMEX> allowing you to post a message reacting to that article and/or to read
how others have reacted or replied. Every posting can start a new discussion
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">thread</ENAMEX>, or extend an ongoing discussion, or "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> off" an ongoing discussion
to take it in a new direction. Especially wise or witty responses will be
reprinted or excerpted on the article page itself.

            The philosophical point
here is that many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> (we hope) would enjoy engaging in a vigorous
discussion of something they have just read but have no special interest in
joining an online "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX>," which is the usual emphasis of Web site bulletin
boards. If you want to join our <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX>, you're very welcome, and you can
treat The Fray like any other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BBS</ENAMEX>. Here is a
link to all our current discussions, including a general discussion, a
discussion for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fraygrants</ENAMEX> (regulars in the "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Old Fray"</ENAMEX>), and a discussion of
technical issues. But if you simply want to tell us how wrong we are about
something, you can skip all that and post a message from the offending page
itself.
