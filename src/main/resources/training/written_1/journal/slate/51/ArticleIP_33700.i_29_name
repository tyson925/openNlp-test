               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tim</ENAMEX>'s Wrap-Up
            

            The way I figure it,
there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> ways to go with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s question. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, as many of you did,
is to take the competition improbably downscale--mixing implausible amounts of
sex and/or violence into the competition. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oddly</ENAMEX>, given the results of
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News Quiz</ENAMEX>, few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> made the obvious leap and added farm
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> as well.) The other, largely neglected option: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Imply</ENAMEX> that the
competition, as currently configured, is improbably upscale. Perhaps the
pageant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">organizers</ENAMEX> could prune the readings from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ionesco</ENAMEX> and the madrigal
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">recital</ENAMEX>, or they could finally stop forcing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">contestants</ENAMEX> to defend their
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">theses</ENAMEX>. Or they could replace the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX>-translation portion of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the evening</TIMEX>
with--oh, I don't know, something frivolous. A swimsuit portion, or perhaps an
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">evening</ENAMEX> gown competition. Everyone likes evening gowns.

            The pageant's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">organizers</ENAMEX>
are cutting back on the number of performances from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> semifinalists to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>,
and they'll be backed by professional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dancers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">musicians</ENAMEX>. According to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA Today</ENAMEX> , pageant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">CEO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Beck</ENAMEX> has found that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewers</ENAMEX> get bored
watching the amateur talent routines. "You can flip to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 or 30</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stations</ENAMEX> and
find great entertainment," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beck</ENAMEX> says. "If, by great entertainment, you mean
programs starring <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dweezil</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ahmet Zappa</ENAMEX>, or the umpteenth <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Discovery Channel</ENAMEX>
special on <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sharks</ENAMEX>," he did not add. In other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA Today</ENAMEX> news, single

               Answer
            

            They are in the correct
order. Each film received a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">star</ENAMEX> less than the one that precedes it. Which
means that, to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger Ebert</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Booty Call</ENAMEX> was twice as good as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blue</ENAMEX>
Velvet . And that he walked out of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Usual Suspects</ENAMEX> saying, "It was
good, but it was no <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dances With Wolves</ENAMEX> ."
