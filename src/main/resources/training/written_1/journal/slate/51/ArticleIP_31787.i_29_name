            In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brent Staples</ENAMEX>' memoir <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Parallel Time</ENAMEX> , he
recounts a game he used to play while a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Chicago</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Staples</ENAMEX>, who is black, would pace the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> surrounding the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">campus</ENAMEX> after
dark. When he spied a white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> strolling toward him arm in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX>, he would
walk directly at them, at a normal pace. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> would first tighten their
grip on each other. Then, as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Staples</ENAMEX> continued to head toward them, they would
panic, release their grip, and scurry apart. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Staples</ENAMEX> would breeze between them,
without losing a step, without looking back. He called it "scattering the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pigeons</ENAMEX>."

            The "pigeons" feared
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Staples</ENAMEX> because of his blackness--they were using his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">race</ENAMEX> as a proxy for
potential criminality. Using superficial traits to infer deeper characteristics
in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> is common and need not be racist. Generalizing from what is easily
and quickly knowable to something that is hard to know for sure is what
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> think of as minimizing information costs. If the clouds turn dark
and ominous and it starts to thunder while you're out for a stroll, you can
find a phone and call the weather service, or you can ignore them on the
grounds that predictions about the weather are often wrong, or you can take
cover under the assumption that it's probably going to rain. But using race as
a proxy is sensitive, for good and obvious reasons.

            If skin color as a proxy for criminal intentions were a
precise tool--that is, if every young black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> strolling the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sidewalks</ENAMEX> were a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mugger</ENAMEX>--it would be hard to criticize. And if the implied generalization had no
validity--if a young black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">male</ENAMEX> was no more likely to be a mugger than anyone
else approaching on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sidewalk</ENAMEX>--it would be easy to label as racist. But,
like most such generalizations, it is valid but not perfect. A young black man
is more likely to be a mugger than a young white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>--but the assumption that
any particular young black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> is a mugger will usually be wrong. So is using
race as a proxy racist?

            This is what the current
"racial profiling" controversy is about. Racial profiling is when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> use
race as a reason to search someone's <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> or to frisk a pedestrian. Almost all
black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> have tales of being stopped by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cop</ENAMEX> for no reason other than their
skin color. It's derisively known as "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">DWB</ENAMEX>": the crime of driving while black.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Earlier this year</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Jersey</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christine Todd Whitman</ENAMEX>, fired the
state police <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">superintendent</ENAMEX> for telling a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalist</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> were more
likely to commit crimes than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX>. But she has since admitted that state
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> systematically stop <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> simply because the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">driver</ENAMEX> is black. And racial
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">profiling</ENAMEX> has many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defenders</ENAMEX> who say it is sensible, hard-nosed policing of the
sort that has led to a dramatic drop in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s crime rate.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> ne generalization that can be made about racial
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">profiling</ENAMEX>--a valid but not perfect generalization, of course--is that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conservatives</ENAMEX> tend to support it, while <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">liberals</ENAMEX> tend to regard it as racist.
In another controversy, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> over affirmative action, the opposite
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">generalization</ENAMEX> holds: <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Liberals</ENAMEX> tend to support it, while <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conservatives</ENAMEX> tend to
regard it as reverse racism.

            And yet affirmative
action and racial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">profiling</ENAMEX> are essentially the same. Affirmative action
amounts to the use of race as a proxy for other, harder-to-discern qualities:
racial victimization, poverty, cultural deprivation. Few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> of affirmative
action are against compensating <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> of specific and proven acts of racial
discrimination. And the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> often positively endorse programs giving a
special break to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who've overcome economic or cultural disadvantage. What
they object to is generalizing these conditions from a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>'s race. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Defenders</ENAMEX>
of affirmative action say, in essence, that as policy-making generalizations
go, this one is overwhelmingly valid--and that more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">justice</ENAMEX> will be lost than
gained by insisting on scientific precision.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Defenders</ENAMEX> of affirmative action and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defenders</ENAMEX> of racial
profiling even resort to the same dodge in defending their cause against
colorblind absolutists. They say they, too, think it's wrong for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> to be
promoted and/or arrested just because of his or her race. But, they say, it's
OK for race to be one factor among many.

            Here is <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gov.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whitman</ENAMEX>,
quoted in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times Magazine</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last month</TIMEX>, explaining the
difference between profiling (good) and racial profiling (bad):

            

               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Profiling</ENAMEX> means a police <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> using cumulative knowledge and training to
identify certain indicators of possible criminal activity. Race may be one of
those factors, but it cannot stand alone. Racial profiling is when race is the
only other factor. There's no other probable cause.

            

            
This precisely echoes <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Justice</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewis Powell</ENAMEX>'s
famous explanation of permissible affirmative action in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1978</TIMEX> Bakke
case:

            
               Ethnic diversity is only one element in a range of factors a
university properly may consider in attaining the goal of a heterogeneous
student <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX>. ... In [a constitutional] admissions program, race or ethnic
background may be deemed a "plus" in a particular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">applicant</ENAMEX> file, yet it does
not insulate the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> from comparison with all other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> for the
available seats.
            

            The factor fudge
satisfies some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX>, but it doesn't solve the racial proxy dilemma. Stopping
and frisking a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">driver</ENAMEX> or admitting a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yale</ENAMEX> is a yes-or-no decision.
As legal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholar</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Randall Kennedy</ENAMEX> wrote in his book Race, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crime</ENAMEX>, and the
Law , "Even if <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">race</ENAMEX> is only one of several factors behind a decision,
tolerating it at all means tolerating it as potentially the decisive
factor." When it's the decisive factor, it might as well have been the only
factor. If it's never decisive, it's not really a factor at all.

             

            The main difference between affirmative
action and racial profiling is that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> singles out <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> for something
desirable and the other singles them out for something undesirable. Reasonable
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> can differ about whether using race as a proxy is OK. Obviously it
depends on how valid the generalization is in any given case, and how costly or
impractical it would be to get alternative information. When you fear a man
approaching you may be a mugger, you may not be able to find out in the next
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five seconds</TIMEX> whether he happens to be a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Chicago</ENAMEX> intellectual
headed for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> editorial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX>. On the other hand, race
is not just any proxy, and probably should be used more sparingly--especially
by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>--than the narrow logic of probabilities would justify.

            Racial proxies are a tough call. But it's safe to
say that anyone who is outraged by racial profiling but tolerates affirmative
action, or vice versa, has got it wrong.
