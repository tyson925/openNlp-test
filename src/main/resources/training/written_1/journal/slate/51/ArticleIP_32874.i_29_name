Relations between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Syria</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> may be warmer than they were, but between
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Syria</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Palestinians</ENAMEX> they are hotter than the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arab</ENAMEX>
press has reacted with consternation <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</TIMEX> to an extraordinary attack on
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Palestinian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yasser Arafat</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Syrian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mustafa Tlass</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> papers have even adopted an "expletives deleted" policy so as not to
offend their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX>. In a speech on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX> to mark <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Syrian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Army Day</ENAMEX>, Tlass
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">attacked Arafat</ENAMEX> for selling out to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jerusalem</ENAMEX> and for kowtowing to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>. "You <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60,000</NUMEX> whores!" he said. "You shouldn't have
been so cowardly and submissive at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>. ... But you just stood
there like a black <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> and didn't dare say a word about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Palestine</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jerusalem</ENAMEX>." Then <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tlass</ENAMEX> compared <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arafat</ENAMEX> to a striptease <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dancer</ENAMEX> in the way he
made concessions to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX>, "Look at him when he's on stage. He moves from
concession to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concession</ENAMEX>, like the stripper, except that she becomes more
beautiful with every layer she removes, while <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yasser Arafat</ENAMEX> becomes
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">uglier</ENAMEX>."

            The
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Palestinian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> daily <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Al-Quds al-Arabi</ENAMEX> (which was
banned in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Syria</ENAMEX> this <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June</TIMEX> when it said <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hafez Assad</ENAMEX> sought peace with
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> only so that he would be able to pass on his job to his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX>) replied
with vigor to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tlass</ENAMEX>' outburst. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">general</ENAMEX> could not be taken seriously, wrote
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abdelbari Atwan</ENAMEX> in an editorial, "for his greatest achievements have not been
in the battlefield in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Palestine</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golan</ENAMEX> but in composing romantic poetry
extolling beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>." <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atwan</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tlass</ENAMEX> should be reminded how the female
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">defense</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minister</ENAMEX> of a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Scandinavian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> once complained of "the disgraceful
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> in which he made a pass at her when she was on a visit to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Damascus</ENAMEX>. ...
Perhaps that would embarrass him into retiring, having plumbed depths of
behavior unworthy of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scout guide</ENAMEX>, let alone the defense <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minister</ENAMEX> of a country
on whose role in recovering usurped <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> rights so much hope was pinned."
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al-Quds al-Arabi</ENAMEX> attributed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tlass</ENAMEX>' outburst in part to a red-carpet
welcome <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arafat</ENAMEX> gave recently to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Assad</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nephew</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sumer Rif'at</ENAMEX>, a possible rival
of his son <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bashar</ENAMEX>'s for the succession.

            In
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ha'aretz</ENAMEX> led <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> with a report
that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Israel Defense Force</ENAMEX> is working on a plan to encourage <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israeli Arabs</ENAMEX>
to volunteer for national service. Under this plan, army <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recruiters</ENAMEX> would
operate openly in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> neighborhoods. "[F]aced with a choice of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youths</ENAMEX> joining an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">extremist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> or volunteering for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDF</ENAMEX>,
it is preferable that they come to us," a senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> was quoted as
saying.

            
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Iraqi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> and former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ambassador</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Majed al-Samara'i</ENAMEX>, predicted
another pointless <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> military assault on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> because of the long-running
deadlock at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Nations</ENAMEX> over the future of sanctions and disarmament
measures against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX>. Writing in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Saudi</ENAMEX> paper <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Asharq al-Awsat</ENAMEX> , he
said there was next to no prospect of an accommodation between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX> but a likelihood instead of more <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> airstrikes that would
leave the underlying problems unresolved.

            The
main story in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">press</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> was the suspension from competition of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Linford Christie</ENAMEX>, the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Olympic</ENAMEX> gold medal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">winner</ENAMEX> for the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100 meters</NUMEX>, after
he tested positive for the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroid nandrolone</ENAMEX> at a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> event. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Christie</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX>,
who is now retired from top-level professional athletics, once called for a
life ban on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">athletes</ENAMEX> found using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>. Meanwhile, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kathy Jager</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">56</TIMEX>, from
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phoenix</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ariz.</ENAMEX>, who won <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> gold medals <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</TIMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Veterans</ENAMEX>
Athletics championships in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX>, was publicly vindicated after rival
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">competitors</ENAMEX> accused her of being a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>. Jager, who has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">grandchildren</ENAMEX>, had her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">femaleness</ENAMEX> confirmed by medical tests. From <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Phoenix</ENAMEX>, her
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">husband Carl</ENAMEX>, to whom she has been married for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30 years</TIMEX>, told the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daily</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Telegraph of</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX>, "She's all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>." Another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> hailed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Telegraph</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> was the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">queen mother</ENAMEX>, who celebrated her <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">99 th</NUMEX> birthday
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX>. "Here is someone with no need for spin <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX>," the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> noted in
an editorial.

            
Another big subject in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">press</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> was the appointment of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Robertson</ENAMEX> as the next <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary-general</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robertson</ENAMEX>'s "extreme" <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scottishness</ENAMEX> was widely noted. "A 'highlander' at
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX>," was the headline in Le <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Figaro</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX>. "The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">granite Scotsman</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX>,"
said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Corriere della Sera</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Milan</ENAMEX>. His appointment was generally
well received. "Descended from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Scottish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">policemen</ENAMEX>, Mr
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robertson</ENAMEX> will now have to police a large part of the world," said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daily</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Telegraph</ENAMEX> 's editorial. It said his main <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">task</ENAMEX>--in addition to improving
military capabilities and technology in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> "so that all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>, not just
the bigger ones, can play their full parts in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kosovo</ENAMEX>"--was
to ensure that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX> "continues to function as one, unified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">alliance</ENAMEX>." The
Times of
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> said his job was to get rid of the "body-bag syndrome" that afflicts
most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX>, "above all that of the militarily dominant <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX>." The
paper said, "[H]e knows that if you want peace, you must be ready for war.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Psychologically</ENAMEX>, politically, and militarily, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nato</ENAMEX> is unready for the next
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">century</ENAMEX>. He has taken on a mammoth job."

            

               Frankfurter Allgemeine
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zeitung</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> led <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>'s decision to continue to
ban imports of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beef</ENAMEX>, risking legal action by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Commission</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brussels</ENAMEX>, which has declared it safe from "mad cow" disease. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Le Monde</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> argued that
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> decision was premature and that it had sacrificed public health
interests to political and diplomatic expediency. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> the conservative
Daily <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mail</ENAMEX> accused both <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> of "breathtaking arrogance,"
which is what it does <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">most days</TIMEX>.

            A
possibly more alarming <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> health scare is a case of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ebola</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>,
which also featured on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Frankfurter Allgemeine</ENAMEX> 's front page. In
another front-page story, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times of London</ENAMEX> described <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> as being
"on <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Ebola fever</ENAMEX> alert" after a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> returned there from a trip to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX>
bleeding through his eyes and ears. "Ebola, which is one of the most infectious
and deadly <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">viruses</ENAMEX>, killing <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">up to 80 per cent</NUMEX> of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX>, is virtually
unknown in the West," it said.

            The
Times led with a report by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Academy of Pediatrics</ENAMEX> warning
against <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> watching too much television. In an editorial on the subject,
it said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">academy</ENAMEX>'s recommendation "that no <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> under <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> should watch
television and that sets should be banned from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedrooms</ENAMEX> of even older
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> represents the gravest challenge to the Western way of life since
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coca-Cola</ENAMEX> tried changing its secret formula. ... It would represent a radical
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alteration</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> habits that could not conceivably be implemented." (For

                  Slate
               's take on the report, see ".")
