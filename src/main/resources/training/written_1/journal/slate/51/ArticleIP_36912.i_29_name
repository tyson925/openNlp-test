            Last
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">51</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senators</ENAMEX> voted not to ratify the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">nuclear Comprehensive Test</ENAMEX>
Ban <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Treaty</ENAMEX>. The direct result of this vote was virtually nothing. No missiles
were launched. No bombs were detonated. No agreements were voided. The treaty
itself remained open to ratification. Instead, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> agreed that the import
of the vote lay in the "signal" it sent to foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX>. At his news
conference <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next day</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> had an opportunity to define that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> for good or ill. He chose both. While assuring other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nations</ENAMEX> that the
vote signified no change in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>'s commitment to nonproliferation, he told
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> that arms control had suffered a disastrous setback and that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX> was withdrawing from the world.

            
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s equivocation on the test ban vote is the latest chapter in the
struggle between his <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personalities</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Policy Bill</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Political Bill</ENAMEX>. Policy
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill</ENAMEX> strives for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solutions</ENAMEX> and looks for deals. Political Bill strives for
advantage and looks for fights. Policy Bill treats elections as a means to
passing legislation. Political Bill treats legislation as a means to winning
elections. Policy <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill</ENAMEX> wants arms control as an accomplishment. Political Bill
wants it as a festering issue. Policy <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill</ENAMEX> wants to frame the treaty vote in a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> that will calm the world by minimizing the perceived damage to arms
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX>. Political Bill wants to frame it in a way that will alarm <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> by maximizing that perceived damage.

            
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> said they voted against the treaty because it lacked adequate
monitoring and enforcement mechanisms, wouldn't affect rogue <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, and
imposed too permanent a commitment on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> to refrain from
testing. Several indicated that they would have supported it if <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> had
worked with them to amend it. By voting against it, were <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> giving
foreign regimes a "green light" to test nuclear weapons? No, they replied. They
argued that the best safeguard against proliferation was the previously
ratified <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty</ENAMEX> and that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> was sending a "green
light" by failing to enforce that pact. Was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GOP</ENAMEX> turning away from the
world? No, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitch McConnell</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ky.</ENAMEX> "The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> are not
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">isolationists</ENAMEX>. We're the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GATT</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NAFTA</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTO</ENAMEX>." Were they
rejecting arms control? No, said the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX>. They observed that pragmatic
hawks such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dick Lugar</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ind.</ENAMEX>, who had supported previous arms control
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pacts</ENAMEX>, deemed this one unwise. "The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> of the nonproliferation effort over
the last <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50 years</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States of America</ENAMEX>, is not abandoning its
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX>," said <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chuck Hagel</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Neb.</ENAMEX> "I don't believe that's what that
vote was about."

            
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> could have used his news conference to affirm this soothing message, as
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe Lieberman</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Conn.</ENAMEX>, did in a joint appearance with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hagel</ENAMEX>. "We have
come together <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> to say to anyone who will listen, to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>,
and hopefully to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> around the world, that although there are not now
sufficient votes in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> to ratify this test ban treaty, that does not
mean that the cause of nuclear nonproliferation died on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> floor
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX>," said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lieberman</ENAMEX>. "That cause ... is embraced by a great majority in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>," he went on. "We do want to signal to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nations</ENAMEX> around the world in the
aftermath of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX>'s vote that neither the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> nor the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">States Senate</ENAMEX> are walking away from our responsibility to lead the effort"
against proliferation.

            At
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s news conference, his <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personalities</ENAMEX> wrestled over how to spin the
vote. Policy <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill</ENAMEX> played it down. "We will not abandon the commitments inherent
in the treaty and resume testing ourselves," he told the world. "I call on
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>, and all other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> to continue to refrain
from testing. I call on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nations</ENAMEX> that have not done so to sign and ratify the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty</ENAMEX>. And I will continue to do all I can to make that
case to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX>. When all is said and done, I have no doubt that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX> will ratify this treaty. ... We are not going to reverse <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40 years</TIMEX> of
commitment on nonproliferation." He concluded: "So I urge [other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nations</ENAMEX>] not
to overreact, to make clear their opposition to what the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> did, but to
stay with us and believe in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, because the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> want
us to lead toward nonproliferation."

            But
Political Bill was determined to punish <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> at the polls by depicting
their vote as a repudiation of arms control. They had "betrayed the vision of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Presidents Eisenhower</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kennedy</ENAMEX>" and embraced "a new isolationism," he
charged. "The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">majority</ENAMEX> has turned its back on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50 years</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
leadership against the spread of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX> of mass destruction. They are saying
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> does not need to lead either by effort or by example. They are saying
we don't need our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">allies</ENAMEX>. ... We say to them [our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">allies</ENAMEX>], 'Go take
a hike.' ... We're not cooperating with them anymore. 'As far as we're
concerned ... anything you want to do with your money is fine with us, because
we have more money than you do, so whatever you do, we'll do more.' "

            
Political <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill</ENAMEX>'s scare tactics destroyed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Policy Bill's</ENAMEX> reassurances. "The
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> should have every assurance that, at least as long as this
administration is here, we support [the moratorium on] nuclear testing," said
Policy Bill. Abruptly, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Political Bill</ENAMEX> interjected, "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Now</ENAMEX>, if we ever get a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> that's against the test ban treaty, which we may get--I mean, there
are plenty of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> out there who say they're against it--then I think you
might as well get ready for it. You'll have <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> testing, you'll have China
testing, you'll have <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> testing, you'll have <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> testing. You'll have
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> abandoning the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Nonproliferation Treaty</ENAMEX>." Political Bill didn't care
how these words affected world <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX>. To him, the test ban treaty was just
another wedge issue. That's why he opened his news conference not by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">distinguishing</ENAMEX> arms control as a transcendent responsibility but by lumping it
together with budget politics: "In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent days</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the congressional
majority have displayed a reckless partisanship. It threatens <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>'s
economic well-being and now our national security."

            
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s partisan <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teammates</ENAMEX> repeated his alarmist spin. "This vote sent a
dangerous message to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> around the world," said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary Clinton</ENAMEX>. In a
campaign ad endorsed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> warned, "This vote goes against the tide of history." The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> had
decided to "roll back <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50 years</TIMEX> of progress on real efforts to stem the nuclear
proliferation," lamented <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Minority Leader</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Daschle</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Dakota</ENAMEX>,
calling it "a definitive vote that said, 'Around the world, we relegate
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> on nuclear proliferation to somebody else.' " The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX>'
campaign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Torricelli</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">N.J.</ENAMEX>, charged, "<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senators</ENAMEX> have
bought responsibility for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">North Koreans</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Iranians</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iraqis</ENAMEX> in
the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next decade</TIMEX>, [who] almost assuredly will continue now with nuclear
programs. ... Other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nations</ENAMEX> are going to interpret this vote by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> as
an opportunity to break out of [<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX>] controls."

            
Foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> were already inclined to interpret the vote
as a renunciation of arms control and global engagement. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> only
encouraged that interpretation. The vote "halted the momentum" toward nuclear
arms control and "further weakened the already shaky standing of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX> as a global moral <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX>," the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> concluded in a
front-page analysis <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s news conference. Another
Times story added that "fears have been heightened by what looks like an
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> renunciation of any controls over its huge nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">arsenal</ENAMEX>," and "the
appearance that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> are moving away from international agreements and
responsibilities can also be alarming." A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los Angeles Times</ENAMEX> analysis
said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> was "signaling an ominous retreat from the world."

            The perverse irony of the
nuclear age is that the survival of humankind has rested as much on
international perception as on reality. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thirty years ago</TIMEX>, it rested on the
perception that we were willing to build bombs and deploy them. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> it rests
increasingly on the perception that we're willing to stop. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> has the
ability to sustain that perception despite the test ban's defeat. If only he
had the will.
