            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">This September</TIMEX>, the New
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">England Journal of Medicine</ENAMEX> created a firestorm when it accused <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX>
of conducting unethical experiments to reduce <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">newborns</ENAMEX> in Third World
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>. The charges, comparing the work to the infamous <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tuskegee</ENAMEX> experiment,
have since halted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX> study. But a closer look suggests that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> suffer from an ethical blindness of their own.

            The
studies in question are seeking low-cost ways to prevent <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>-positive pregnant
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> from transmitting the virus to their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">newborns</ENAMEX>. A breakthrough <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX>
study found a drug regimen that dramatically reduced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX>-transmission
rates--from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">26 percent</NUMEX> of births to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8 percent</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Doctors</ENAMEX> in industrialized
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nations</ENAMEX> rapidly adopted the strategy as the standard of care. At <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$800</NUMEX> a pop,
however, poor <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> can't afford the full regimen. It's also too complex.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mothers</ENAMEX> must take <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AZT</ENAMEX>, an antiviral, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> times a day during pregnancy; receive
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">intravenous AZT</ENAMEX> during labor; forgo breastfeeding to prevent transmission in
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk</ENAMEX>; and give their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">babies</ENAMEX> liquid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AZT</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> times <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six weeks</TIMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sixteen</ENAMEX> studies to find simpler, cheaper methods are now
testing everything from vitamin A to a shorter course of oral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AZT</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Centers for Disease Control</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prevention</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Institutes of</ENAMEX>
Health fund <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> of these, involving <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12,211</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Uganda</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Thailand</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tanzania</ENAMEX>, and elsewhere. In every study, some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> must serve as a
comparison <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, and that's where the trouble begins. For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</TIMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> debated whether to compare new therapies to the full <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AZT</ENAMEX> regimen or
to no treatment at all. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> trials gave the comparison
group a placebo.

            In their
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">article</ENAMEX> reopening the debate, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Lurie</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sidney Wolfe</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ralph</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nader</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Public Citizen Health Research Group</ENAMEX>, condemned these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> trials.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Researchers</ENAMEX> giving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">placebos</ENAMEX>, they said, were knowingly killing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>. They
quoted the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Helsinki Declaration of the World Health Organization</ENAMEX>: "In any
medical study, every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>--including those of a control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, if
any--should be assured of the best proven diagnostic and therapeutic methods."
To them, the only valid question is how new treatments compare to the complex
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AZT</ENAMEX> treatment.

            
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal</ENAMEX> 's editorial was even more
pointed. It accused <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> of "self-serving justification," and
likened their studies to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tuskegee</ENAMEX> experiment. Conducted by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Public</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Health Service</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1932 to 1972</TIMEX>, that study left <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">412</NUMEX> black syphilitic men
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">untreated</ENAMEX>--even after penicillin became widely available--in an attempt to
determine the natural history of syphilis. The experiment, halted only after
exposure by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalists</ENAMEX>, remains a textbook example of unethical, racist
research.

            The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal</ENAMEX> 's charges made front-page news. Only a pre-publication leak
allowed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIH</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harold Varmus</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Satcher</ENAMEX> to publish
their indignant defense <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next week</TIMEX>. In an unlikely spectacle, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Republican</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan Coats</ENAMEX> stood up for poor <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Africans</ENAMEX> to oppose <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Satcher</ENAMEX>'s nomination for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">surgeon general</ENAMEX>. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ultimately</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate Labor Committee</ENAMEX> approved <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Satcher</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> to
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>.) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Johns Hopkins</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> suspended an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Ethiopian</ENAMEX> study with placebos. Other
suspensions may follow.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ethics</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> insist, demand that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX>
provide the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX> standard of care to Third World <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> to avoid
exploitation. But they don't. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX>' arguments seem reasonable only if
they ignore the facts:

            
               This isn't Tuskegee .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tuskegee</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> sought no public review, had no clearly beneficial aim,
and deceived <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> into getting no treatment. By comparison, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX> trials
were reviewed extensively and approved by local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> and the World
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Health Organization</ENAMEX>. The experimental therapies may offer great benefit. And
some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> receive placebos because, unlike penicillin for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alabama</ENAMEX>, the full
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AZT</ENAMEX> regimen is out of reach for poor <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>.

            
               The complete <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AZT</ENAMEX> regimen
isn't coming . By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 million</NUMEX> pregnant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> in developing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nations</ENAMEX> will
carry <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Critics</ENAMEX> are right that a complex <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AZT</ENAMEX> regimen would be best for them.
It is the standard of care. So are <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CAT</ENAMEX> scanners and heart-bypass surgery. But
poor <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> aren't going to get any of these. Cost is a big reason--these
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> typically spend <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">under $20</NUMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> on health care <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annually</TIMEX>. But
even if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Glaxo Wellcome</ENAMEX> gave away the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>, the complete regimen is still
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">infeasible</ENAMEX> in much of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">south Asia</ENAMEX>. There, tubing and skills for
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">intravenous AZT</ENAMEX> are scarce. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> can't afford to give moms formula
to stop them from breast-feeding. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mothers</ENAMEX> also live too far from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> to get
therapy early in pregnancy and to keep up with necessary monitoring.

            
               Something may be better
than nothing . If trials compared low-cost therapy to the complete <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AZT</ENAMEX>
regimen it's likely that the new regimens will prove less effective. But
such results are useless , since the full treatment is not an option.
Without a placebo <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, we still won't know if any of the treatments are
better than nothing and therefore worth giving.

            
               We've
been here before . These issues aren't new. Cheap oral hydration, for
example, has been studied and used to treat dehydration for diarrheal illness
in developing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>. It works--but not as well as intravenous hydration.
Far from condemning its use as unethical, however, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> have embraced oral
hydration as the model of locally appropriate therapy. Similarly, poor
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> won't adopt a new rotavirus <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine</ENAMEX>, despite <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">600,000</NUMEX> deaths a year
from diarrhea caused by the bug. Inoculating every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$30</NUMEX> a dose would
divert scarce resources from even better uses.

            The core issue is whether it is ethical for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> to
conduct Third World studies seeking therapies cheaper and perhaps inferior to
our own. It can be, but only if: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) Subjects get the best care feasible locally
(they do). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) It's done for local benefit (measuring a new therapy against
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">placebo</ENAMEX> isn't useful for the West; we'd switch only if it were as effective as
the more complex therapy). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) The new regimens are themselves feasible (at
costs from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">pennies to $60</NUMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>, they seem to be). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">standard</ENAMEX> is unavailable for legitimate reasons (I've already mentioned all the
obstacles).

            For the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Public</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Citizen</ENAMEX>, this last criterion really sticks in their craws. It offends them to
see <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> accepting the high cost of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> medical care as a given.
Could drug <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> lower their costs? Maybe, maybe not. But this is not the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> to debate free-market pricing of technology. Don't stop the research.
Acknowledging reality isn't unethical, but ignoring it can be.
