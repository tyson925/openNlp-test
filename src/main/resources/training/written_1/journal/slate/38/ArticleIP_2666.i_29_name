            A frightening study,
recently reported in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New England Journal of Medicine</ENAMEX> , found that
long-haul <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">truck</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drivers</ENAMEX> frequently nod off on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>. An accompanying
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEJM</ENAMEX> editorial forcefully emphasized the safety importance of adequate
sleep. Yet, somehow <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX>'s premier <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journal</ENAMEX> ignored <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX> training, in
which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> work <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">even longer hours</TIMEX> without any sleep at all. If driving a
truck on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five hours</TIMEX> of sleep is dangerous, surely taking care of deathly ill
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> on no sleep is too.

            The
trucking study found that, although long-haul <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drivers</ENAMEX> had <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">at least eight hours</TIMEX>
off a day, they slept <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">only 4.8 hours</TIMEX> on average--<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night-haulers just 3.8 hours</TIMEX>.
It clearly wasn't enough. Surveillance videotape showed that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">56 percent</NUMEX> drifted
off for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">at least six minutes</TIMEX> while traveling <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">over 45 miles per hour</NUMEX>. Drowsiness
was worst during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the night</TIMEX> and among those with the least amount of sleep. On
brain-wave recordings, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drivers</ENAMEX> even fell into light sleep--one for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">40 seconds</TIMEX>. Fortunately, no one crashed. Nonetheless, sleepy truckers
were dangerously impaired.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEJM</ENAMEX> editorial hailed the study as yet more
evidence that sleep deprivation kills. Penned by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stanford</ENAMEX> sleep <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX> Dr.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Dement</ENAMEX>, the editorial pointed to previous work showing sleep loss
harmed performance just as much as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> did. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Truckers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> who work
drowsy, it said, are as dangerous as those who work drunk. And <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX>?
According to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dement</ENAMEX>, his original version did include <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX>, but
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEJM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> removed such references. Perhaps it was because of length,
he suggested. A more likely explanation is that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journal</ENAMEX> found it easier to
needle others than to take on its own profession. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEJM</ENAMEX> declined to
comment.

            In
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">residency</ENAMEX>, sleep deprivation, like <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX> and death, is a fact of life. Fresh
out of medical school, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> get on-the-job training performing day-to-day
patient care in academic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>. According to these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">first-year</TIMEX>
residents work <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">70- to 80-hour weeks</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">up to 30 days</TIMEX> consecutively (and some
think these estimates understate the case). Residents routinely work <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">36-hour</TIMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stretches</ENAMEX>, often without sleep.

            
During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">my first two years</TIMEX> of surgery residency,
I worked <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">from 80 to 110 hours</TIMEX> a week, depending on how busy things were.
Typically, I arrived at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 a.m. and</TIMEX> left at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">7:30 p.m.</TIMEX>, except <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">every third night</TIMEX>
when I stayed to take care of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> while my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> went home. Pages were
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">incessant</ENAMEX>: "Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> just threw up," "The gallbladder lady isn't breathing very
well." I got sleep in snatches--some <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">nights totaling four hours</TIMEX> or more, others
none at all. Regardless, I operated through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next day</TIMEX> like any other.

            Constant
fatigue can't be good for patient care. In the infamous <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Libby Zion</ENAMEX> case in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">York City</ENAMEX>, in which an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18-year-old</TIMEX> died while under a fatigued <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">resident</ENAMEX>'s care,
a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1984</TIMEX> grand jury denounced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX> training as unsafe. Yet, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">over a decade</TIMEX>
later, no rigorous research like the trucking study has been done. The limited
studies that exist bode poorly for good doctoring. Although tired <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX>
maintain reaction time and manual dexterity surprisingly well, they exhibit
memory deficits, difficulties thinking clearly, and decreased vigilance. They
also develop alarming levels of hostility toward <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.

            These studies ring true to me. To be sure, I'm often amazed
at how well I can do on no sleep. When you're faced with a dying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> or a
difficult operation, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">adrenalin</ENAMEX> focuses your mind and marshals your energy. I
honestly think I'm dependable in clutch situations, even after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">36 hours</TIMEX> on the
job.

            But I'm
also sure that routine care suffers. Good care for sick <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> depends on
attention to details--getting drug doses right, checking every lab result and
X-ray conscientiously, remembering a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">allergies</ENAMEX> and old medical
problems. No matter how hard I try, I know my memory and vigilance fail when
I'm sleep-deprived. At times I was so tired that I gave <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurses</ENAMEX> orders that I
later couldn't remember giving. Backup systems do catch mistakes. The computer
won't accept my drug orders if I prescribe the wrong dose or ignore an allergy.
Nurses remind me to check an X-ray or question me when my order doesn't seem
right. Nonetheless, many errors are not caught, and I know I have seriously
harmed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> because of fatigue.

            
I've felt the hostility, too. When you're
finally set to sleep or go home, nothing is more frustrating than a patient
having unexpected problems. Rest becomes a matter of personal survival, and
residents can be chillingly brusque with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who need only time and
sympathy. Anger is so common that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard</ENAMEX> residency program gives an
"award" <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each year</TIMEX> to its angriest interns.

            Can
anything be done? <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Hospitals</ENAMEX> could hire more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX>, but that would increase
our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX> glut. In fact, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> banned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> from increasing resident
hires <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Hospitals</ENAMEX> could hire <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician assistants</ENAMEX> to handle calls that
don't require <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX>, but that's expensive. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Physician assistants</ENAMEX> get paid
twice a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">resident</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$30,000</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yearly</TIMEX> salary for working <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">only 40 hours</TIMEX> a week. In
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, guidelines for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an 80-hour</TIMEX> maximum <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">workweek</TIMEX> were estimated to
increase staffing costs by a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">quarter-billion dollars</NUMEX> per year. Exceptions were
quickly carved out (for example, surgical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> aren't included), and even
then many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> could not afford to stick to the guidelines.

            Increasingly, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> use "cross coverage," in which a
fresh resident covers <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> for several other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>. However, a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard</ENAMEX> study showed that the covering <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> made serious mistakes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>
times more often than even fatigued <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX>. They had too many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and,
with every patient new to them, didn't know important details. Tired <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX>
may not provide the best care, but neither does a series of faceless <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX>
working shifts.

            Research by sleep <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX>, to
examine resident safety and to test solutions, is needed. In any other
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">circumstance</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> would champion thorough, dispassionate investigation and
spare no expense to improve <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>' lives. But on this subject, the medical
profession is asleep at the switch. If it doesn't wake up soon, another
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">scandalous</ENAMEX> case will inevitably surface, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> will take matters
into its own hands.
