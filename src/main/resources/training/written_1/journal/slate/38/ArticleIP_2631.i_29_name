            Let me tell you a story
about jeans. Actually, let me tell you a story about <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> that sell
jeans. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of them, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Levi Strauss</ENAMEX>, is about the best that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> capitalism
has to offer both in terms of ethical business practices and the way it treats
its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>. The other, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guess Inc.</ENAMEX>, is about the worst, notorious for its
maltreatment of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> and its ruthlessness in business. Now, if this were
a story with an ending written by social <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">democrats</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Levi's</ENAMEX> would be rewarded
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guess</ENAMEX> would be punished. And if this story had an ending written by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neoclassical economists</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guess</ENAMEX> would triumph and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Levi's</ENAMEX> would pay the price for
its attempt to evade market imperatives. What makes the story interesting,
though, is that young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> are writing it, and so it ends with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> doing business in polar ways but arriving at exactly the same place:
somewhere behind the curve.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Levi's</ENAMEX> is the world's
largest clothing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX>, doing <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$7 billion</NUMEX> in sales <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every year</TIMEX>. It is also
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the few privately held large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> left in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, thanks
to a management-led leveraged buyout in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1985</TIMEX>. Since the LBO, which followed a
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> in which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> saw its earnings drop by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">97 percent</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Levi</ENAMEX>'s economic
performance has been outstanding, thanks in no small part to the rebirth of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">501 Buttonfly</ENAMEX> and, unfortunately, the remarkable success of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dockers</ENAMEX>. A recent
outside appraisal of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> placed its market value at somewhere near <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">105</NUMEX>
times what it was in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1984</TIMEX>, a growth rate analogous to that of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> like
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oracle</ENAMEX>.

            In the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">past couple of years</TIMEX>, though, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Levi's</ENAMEX> has struggled. Overall sales have slowed,
and its share of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>'s jeans market has shrunk from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">48 percent</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX> to
<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">26 percent</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>. It would be great to see this decline as divine retribution
for the invention of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dockers</ENAMEX>, but the answer has more to do with dramatic
changes in the kinds of jeans <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> buy and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Levi</ENAMEX>'s failure to adapt to those
changes. At a time when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> influenced by hip-hop culture were buying jeans
with legs as wide around as their waists, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Levi's</ENAMEX> was still pushing its classic
straight-leg look. And although it's now starting to push its baggy <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Silver Tab</ENAMEX>
jeans hard, so-called private brands, marketed by department <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">J.C.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Penney</ENAMEX>, are stealing the low end of the market while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ralph Lauren</ENAMEX> and his
clones are eroding the high end. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Levi's</ENAMEX> has become the dreaded "tweener,"
caught between the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boomers</ENAMEX> and the echo-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boomers</ENAMEX>.

            The results have not been pretty. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A month ago</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Levi</ENAMEX>'s
announced that it would be closing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> of its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> and laying off <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one-third</NUMEX> of
its <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">North American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">work force</ENAMEX>, an astounding step for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> renowned for
what its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">CEO</ENAMEX> called "long-term brand <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>, corporate social responsibility,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> involvement." <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Levi</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> have always been well paid relative
to the industry as a whole, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> has kept <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">55 percent</NUMEX> of its
manufacturing work force in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>, the company
implemented Japanese-style production techniques in its sewing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>, breaking
apart routinized <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> and giving individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> more responsibility.
Even <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Levi</ENAMEX>'s severance package is impressive. With each laid-off worker
receiving <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eight months</TIMEX>' pay plus <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one week</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every year</TIMEX> of service, and
company-funded retraining to boot, one union <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observer</ENAMEX> called it "by far the
best severance settlement apparel <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> have ever gotten."

            Given all
that, the easy way to understand what happened to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Levi Strauss</ENAMEX> is to assume
that its generosity caught up with it. If you employ unionized <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> workers
instead of dollar-a-day <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>, you will fail. But a look at its
competition shows that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Levi</ENAMEX>'s main problem is not price cutting but image. Its
largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">competitor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VF</ENAMEX>, which makes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wrangler</ENAMEX>, charges only marginally
less, and yet its market share has risen as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Levi's</ENAMEX> has fallen. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Retailers</ENAMEX> like
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tommy Hilfiger</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ralph Lauren</ENAMEX>, whose jeans are not dramatically superior to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Levi's</ENAMEX> in quality, are able to charge more simply because of their name. In the
end, staying ahead of the style curve is both harder and more important than
cutting costs.

            
As evidence, one might want to look at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guess</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inc.</ENAMEX>, the jeans <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">maker</ENAMEX> legendary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">for making Anna Nicole Smith</ENAMEX> a household name
(well, in some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> at least). Guess--there's a question mark at the end
of the name, but typing it over and over is more annoying than you can
imagine--was the hip jean of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1980s</TIMEX>, and it has spent most of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this decade</TIMEX>
growing rapidly, both at home and abroad. Unlike <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Levi's</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guess</ENAMEX> has made its way
in the world by subcontracting out production work, violating minimum-wage and
maximum<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-hour</TIMEX> laws, and suing everyone in sight. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1980s</TIMEX>, for example, as
part of a legal battle with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jordache</ENAMEX>, which at the time owned <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 percent</NUMEX> of
Guess, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marciano</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brothers</ENAMEX>--who now own the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>--set up a kickback scheme
with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">contractors</ENAMEX> that ensured that money went to them and not to their
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partners</ENAMEX>. About the same time, they suborned an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> into initiating
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">criminal</ENAMEX> tax probes of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jordache</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX>, probes that ended up going nowhere
but were wonderful harassment devices.

            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX>,
Guess paid the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Labor Department</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$573,000</NUMEX> in fines for those minimum-wage and
overtime-pay violations, and things seemed to have quieted down a bit within
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bulletproof-windowed</ENAMEX>, razor-wire-surrounded stone <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> that serves as
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>'s bunker ... I mean, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX>. But in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past year and a half</TIMEX>,
Guess has seen its stock price cut in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>, had the only outside <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of its
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX> quit after being on the job for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few weeks</TIMEX>, and watched its
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief financial officer</ENAMEX> resign for "personal" reasons. Meanwhile it has had a
formal complaint filed against it by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Labor Relations Board</ENAMEX> for
firing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> who were trying to organize a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">union</ENAMEX>, creating an in-house
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">union</ENAMEX> to undermine those organizing efforts, and coercing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> into
participating in an anti-union rally. It's capitalism with an inhuman face.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coincidentally</ENAMEX> or not, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guess</ENAMEX>' earnings and revenue also
have slid sharply, and what's interesting is that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guess</ENAMEX>' problems seem, in
substance, almost identical to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Levi's</ENAMEX>. Although the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marcianos</ENAMEX> are legendary for
their abusive and intimidating management style--<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> former company <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFO</ENAMEX> called
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Marciano</ENAMEX> "psychotic" in a sworn affidavit--and for their habit of taking
huge dividends out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>'s profits, they're not doing anything
different <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> from the way they did business <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three years ago</TIMEX>. They've always
been crazy. It's just that now the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Guess</ENAMEX> label has lost its cachet. The buzz is
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fading</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>'s jeans in particular, which a Fortune writer
once said "made <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> look like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parisian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hookers</ENAMEX>," seem like a vestige of a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> when we read <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Less Than Zero</ENAMEX> and listened to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Echo</ENAMEX> and the Bunnymen
(which we may do still, but while wearing khakis). Without cachet, what does
Guess have? Mostly, a really lousy labor-relations record.

            So is the moral of the story
that both the high <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> and the low <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> can take you into trouble if you stop
paying attention to the taste <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">makers</ENAMEX>? Partly. But the differences between the
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>--both, it's worth remembering, controlled by a small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders</ENAMEX>--also demonstrate that the choice of the high or the low <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> is a
real choice. And our ideas of what constitutes a fair wage or a fair return on
capital are historically contingent. Is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporation</ENAMEX> supposed to net <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>
percent of its sales or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 percent</NUMEX>? Should <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> be paid <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> times the
median wages of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> times? The market does not dictate a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">universal</ENAMEX> solution to these questions, and so <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Levi's</ENAMEX> and Guess are able to
answer them in very different ways. Unfortunately, in the face of the universal
solvent of hipness, how you answer those questions seems to matter less than
how you respond to this one: "So, do you have the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">35-inch</NUMEX>-wide legs or don't
you?"
