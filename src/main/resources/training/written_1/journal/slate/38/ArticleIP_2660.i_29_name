            With surprisingly little
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fanfare</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> recently passed laws calling for castration--either
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chemical</ENAMEX> or surgical--of sex <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">offenders</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last month</TIMEX>, prompted by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prisoners</ENAMEX>
who actually wanted the treatment, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gov.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Bush</ENAMEX> signed a law
letting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judges</ENAMEX> offer castration as an option for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">perpetrators</ENAMEX> of sex crimes.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Montana</ENAMEX> have all enacted more stringent laws to order
involuntary chemical or surgical castration of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">criminals</ENAMEX>.

            The
technology for castration has evolved considerably, and there is evidence that,
in some circumstances, it can dramatically reduce the likelihood a sex offender
will strike again. Nonetheless, there are strong reasons that court-ordered
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">castration</ENAMEX> is a bad idea.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> remain frustrated with the inability of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">justice</ENAMEX> system to control rape and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> molestation. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Dozens</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> have
enacted so-called <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Megan's Laws</ENAMEX> requiring that the public be notified when
released sex <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">offenders</ENAMEX> move in nearby, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> complain that it doesn't help
much to know that your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX> is a pedophile if you can't do anything about
it. More <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> are turning to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> to solve the problem for them.

            Compulsory
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">castration</ENAMEX> has been used as a punishment for crimes in all cultures dating back
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Middle Ages</TIMEX>, the "eye for an eye"
philosophy of jus talionis included castration as punishment for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adultery</ENAMEX> or rape. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 20 th century</TIMEX>, castration has been practiced
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Netherlands</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Estonia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iceland</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Switzerland</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Scandinavia</ENAMEX> for
rape, pedophilia, and homosexuality. After <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX>, its use in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> was
dramatically scaled back, probably because of the increased awareness of
humanitarian concerns prompted by the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Holocaust</ENAMEX>.

            
More recently, research has produced powerful
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>, such as cyproproterone and medroxyprogesterone, which reversibly block
testosterone production. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>' primary use in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> is to control prostate
<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>, but when injected <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekly</TIMEX> they reduce testosterone to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">castration</ENAMEX> levels. Side effects include serious allergic reactions and the
formation of blood clots that can kill <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> also appear to alter
thinking enough to increase suicide rates. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Czech Republic</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> have
reintroduced castration in this modern, seemingly humane form, although only
among sex <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">offenders</ENAMEX> who volunteer for treatment.

            Surgical castration is less
mutilating than it once was. Orchiectomy, as it is called, is a day-surgery
procedure done under local anesthesia. Each testicle is removed through a small
scrotal incision similar to the kind made during a vasectomy.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> of
the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> new state laws call for sentencing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rapists</ENAMEX> to be castrated, but with
some variations. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Florida</ENAMEX> requires <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judges</ENAMEX> to impose either injections or
orchiectomy for repeat <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rapists</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> does the same, but only for repeat
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child molesters</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Montana</ENAMEX> allows, but does not require, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judges</ENAMEX> to impose
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chemical</ENAMEX> castration on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">offenders</ENAMEX> who commit rape or incest after even one
offense, if it is particularly heinous.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Legislators</ENAMEX> argue that castration is justified and
appropriate, and that by controlling sex <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">offenders</ENAMEX>' irresistible urges to rape
or molest again, the operation allows them to be released without endangering
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX>. Studies of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> experience suggest they could be right. Of
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 700</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Danish</ENAMEX> sex <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">offenders</ENAMEX> castrated after multiple convictions,
relapse rates dropped from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">between 17 percent and 50 percent</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">just 2 percent</NUMEX>.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Norwegian</ENAMEX> study showed the same for selected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">male</ENAMEX> and female sex offenders
(the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> had their ovaries removed). In smaller studies of cyproproterone in
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scandinavia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX>, chemical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">castration</ENAMEX> was equally effective in some groups
of volunteer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prisoners</ENAMEX>, with the most dramatic reductions among pedophiles.

            These studies suggest the
common argument--that rape is all about power, not sex, and therefore
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">castration</ENAMEX> won't work--is wrong. Interestingly, a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> study found that up to
half of the castrated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> still could have erections and sex, but their desire
was weakened or even extinguished. Over <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80 percent</NUMEX> no longer masturbated; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX>
percent gave up sex. As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fred Berlin</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Johns Hopkins University</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">psychiatrist</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX> on treating sex <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">offenders</ENAMEX>, points out, castration works "mainly in
those who are sexually aroused by their crime ... sadists and pedophiles."
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Castration</ENAMEX> takes the impulse away from those with an aberrant sexual
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">orientation</ENAMEX>, often to their relief.

            So what objection could there
be to castration of sex <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">offenders</ENAMEX>? Well, none, if it is carefully applied to
the narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of repeat sadistic or pedophiliac <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rapists</ENAMEX> who accept the
treatment. But the court-mandated castration proposed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montana</ENAMEX> raises serious problems.

             

            
               <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> The laws are wrong to apply castration
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">indiscriminately</ENAMEX>. The studies show that castration is effective in
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">criminals</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple offenses</ENAMEX>, especially if they are motivated by sex. But
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">proponents</ENAMEX> are wrongly using the data to justify mandatory application across
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Montana</ENAMEX>, all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rapists</ENAMEX> are targeted, even though
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sadists</ENAMEX> and pedophiles are only a small percentage of the total. Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rapists</ENAMEX>
appear to be motivated by hatred or anger, not sex. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Montana</ENAMEX> lets <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judges</ENAMEX> order
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">castration</ENAMEX> after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">just one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">offense</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berlin</ENAMEX> argues that the laws impose "a
medical intervention in the absence of evidence that forced treatment is likely
... to be effective" and make "no effort to medically assess whether
[<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">castration</ENAMEX>] is appropriate for an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX>."

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2 Forced</ENAMEX> castration is difficult to administer. First,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> must find <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> willing to do the job. (Heaven's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> had
to go to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX> because no <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> would perform it
on them.) <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>'s law suggests letting state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> give the injections
without medical supervision, but the serious side effects, and the need to
ensure that appropriate doses are given, make this approach foolhardy. It also
raises the question of what to do with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who can't take the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> because
of the side effects. Would they have to go back to jail? Bringing in released
convicts for injections is even more difficult. The longest-lasting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX>,
medroxyprogesterone, still must be given <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekly</TIMEX>. Making sure that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rapists</ENAMEX> and
pedophiles turn up <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week after week</TIMEX> for an unwanted, potentially lifelong
treatment may prove impossible.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3 Forced</ENAMEX> castration is immoral. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1985</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme</ENAMEX>
Court recognized this when it ruled that involuntary surgical castration
constituted cruel and unusual punishment. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> may be persuaded to let
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chemical</ENAMEX> castration stand because it is theoretically reversible. If this line
is crossed, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> would have little to stop them from seeking forced
treatments to control other behaviors, such as adultery (for which castration
has historically been a punishment), prostitution, or the consumption of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pornography</ENAMEX>. As <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">arsenal</ENAMEX> expands (we already have <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> to limit
libido, hunger, and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">depression</ENAMEX>), it is conceivable that laws could mandate even
wider uses of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicines</ENAMEX> to control the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>.

            Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> see <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rapists</ENAMEX> as a special case, though, having
no objections to extreme measures to stop them from raping again. The crime is
so repugnant, they say, that it is hard to treat <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rapists</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> deserving of
any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prisoners</ENAMEX>, after all, give up their rights for having committed
such crimes. But as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bioethicist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arthur Caplan</ENAMEX> points out, while "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prisoners</ENAMEX> are
excluded from moral life," losing the right to vote, "<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> have not
reduced them to non-human status." Unlike <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Turkey</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Nazi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX> accepts <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prisoners</ENAMEX>' rights to free speech, legal representation,
and health care. We still reject using <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prisoners</ENAMEX> for organ transplants or slave
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">labor</ENAMEX>. Requiring castration for rape means we have decided it is acceptable to
treat <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prisoners</ENAMEX> as less than human.

            While the laws elsewhere fail
to counter these fundamental objections, the narrower castration law in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>
seems more appropriate. It does not mandate castration, instead reserving it
for repeat <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">offenders</ENAMEX> who seek the treatment. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry Don McQuay</ENAMEX> could be the
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> to whom it is applied. He admits to molesting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> at least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">240</NUMEX>
times. Having completed his sentence for his <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> conviction, he is set for
release. Fearing his urges, he wants orchiectomy. It should be done.
