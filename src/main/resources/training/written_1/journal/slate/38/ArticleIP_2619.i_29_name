            Here's a short course in the
economics of the movie industry: Never have so many invested so much for so
little. At a time when <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporations</ENAMEX> in general are enjoying
historically large profit margins and double-digit annual growth rates,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX> confronts stagnant sales, declining viewership, and astonishingly low
profit margins. The usual suspects--inflated salaries, inattention to costs,
and competition from other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX>--can be blamed for some of the industry's
woes. But, in large part, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX>'s troubles are an object lesson in what
happens when short-term gambling replaces long-term planning.

            Consider
the recent announcement that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer</ENAMEX>'s current <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX>--<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">billionaire</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kirk Kerkorian</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Australian</ENAMEX> media <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">magnate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kerry Stokes</ENAMEX>--will offer <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12.5</NUMEX>
percent of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> to the public <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later this year</TIMEX>. The IPO is expected to
raise <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">close to $250 million</NUMEX>. Although any number of Wall Street <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">execs</ENAMEX> counseled
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGM</ENAMEX> against going public this soon (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goldman, Sachs</ENAMEX> actually refused to
underwrite the IPO because it thought the deal was too hasty), the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">studio</ENAMEX> wants
to reap the benefits of the bull market; it also wants the cash as quickly as
possible. In inimitable <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX> fashion, the IPO is scheduled to coincide
with the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">release date</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Tomorrow Never Dies</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">studio</ENAMEX>'s new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">James</ENAMEX>
Bond film, because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGM</ENAMEX> figures that the free publicity will boost the stock
price.

            The painful truth is that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">studio</ENAMEX> is probably right
about the impact of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bond</ENAMEX> film on the IPO, because the residual glamour of
the movies is the only reason one could justify investing in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGM</ENAMEX>. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> is marketing itself as the only "pure play" movie investment, since
other public <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> that make movies are also involved in nonfilm
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX>. Unfortunately, it's not clear that the "pure play" aspect of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> is a plus. It's especially dubious when one considers that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGM</ENAMEX> has
released just one film, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hoodlum</ENAMEX> , since <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kerkorian</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stokes</ENAMEX> bought the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 1996</TIMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Eleven</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> is a long time to go without cash flow
when you've got <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">hundreds of millions of dollars</NUMEX> a year in overhead costs.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tomorrow</TIMEX> Never Dies had better be a big hit.

            This
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reliance</ENAMEX> on the success of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one or two</NUMEX> films is unique to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGM</ENAMEX> and to this
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>--the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">studio</ENAMEX> should have a full slate again in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>--but it does epitomize
the industry's new dependence on blockbusters. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">This year</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nine summer</TIMEX> pictures
cost <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">close to $100 million</NUMEX> each; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">behemoths</ENAMEX> will open by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX>.
The only real successes among <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX> releases were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Men</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Black</ENAMEX> ,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force One</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Lost World</ENAMEX> . But the size of those
successes is worth keeping in mind. In domestic receipts alone, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> should
clear <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$150 million</NUMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Men</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Black</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">close to $90 million</NUMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Force One</ENAMEX> , while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Universal</ENAMEX> took home around <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$140 million</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Lost</ENAMEX>
World . Toss in foreign sales, video, and merchandising, and the profits are
enough to fund an entire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">studio</ENAMEX>'s output for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six months</TIMEX>.

            
The equation here is simple enough, and helps
explain why the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$15-million</NUMEX> thriller has become a thing of the past. If you can
earn a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>-percent return on your investment, it's better to invest <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$90 million</NUMEX>
than <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$10 million</NUMEX>. And even if you miss <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> out of every <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> times, you still
may bring home enough from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> hits to stay profitable. In addition, the
lack of accountability that dominates <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX> encourages the managerial
pursuit of self-interest. A studio <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> who wants to safeguard his
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lifestyle</ENAMEX> has to be more interested in the size of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">studio</ENAMEX>'s production
budget than in the bottom line. In other words, he lives better losing money on
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$450 million</NUMEX> in sales than he would making money on <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$200 million</NUMEX>.

            
Conventional wisdom has it that this embrace of the blockbuster represents the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ultimate</ENAMEX> triumph of commerce over art, dooming <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX> movies to mediocrity.
As <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rob Reiner</ENAMEX> put it: "[<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>]he <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">studios</ENAMEX> aren't in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX> of putting
on shows but turning out product. And you can't make films as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">product</ENAMEX>." But
there are a couple of rather gaping holes in this thesis. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> is that if
movies are all about making money now, they're doing a very bad job of it. One
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> recently estimated that the return on capital in the industry is around
<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.3 percent</NUMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> is that the glory days of classic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cinema</ENAMEX> were
precisely <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the days</TIMEX> when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">studios</ENAMEX> were most run like <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factories</ENAMEX> churning out a
product. The vertical integration of the studio system mimicked the vertical
integration of the auto and steel industries, as did the hierarchical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">command</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actors</ENAMEX> made the films they were told to
make, or else they were suspended. And the movie industry was more popular--and
more profitable--than it has been since.

            In addition, almost all the philistinism for which
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX> is attacked <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>--the reliance on big <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stars</ENAMEX>, the tendency to mimic
rather than to innovate, the reliance on sequels--was characteristic of
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX>'s heyday as well. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGM</ENAMEX> was known for having "more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stars</ENAMEX> than heaven."
When <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Gone With the Wind</ENAMEX> was in production, other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">studios</ENAMEX> rushed to find
other antebellum epics. And as far as sequels go, the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Batman</ENAMEX> series doesn't
compare with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGM</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andy Hardy</ENAMEX> series or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abbott</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Costello</ENAMEX>, who starred in
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> hits during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1941 and 1942</TIMEX>.

            What's
really different is not the quality of the films but the control that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">studios</ENAMEX> exercise over them. Before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1948</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">studios</ENAMEX> owned <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70 percent</NUMEX> of first-run
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">urban</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">theaters</ENAMEX>, which meant that they were in charge of production,
distribution, and exhibition. At the same time, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">studios</ENAMEX> used their
oligopolistic power to force independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">theater</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> to screen B films if
they also wanted to screen A films. That ensured a reliable flow of profits
from movies that cost very little to make. But a series of antitrust decisions
after <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX> ended these practices and forced the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">studios</ENAMEX> to divest
themselves of their theater holdings, while also encouraging the development of
independent production <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>. That, in turn, made most creative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">independent contractors</ENAMEX>. And the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">studios</ENAMEX> became more involved in
financing and distribution than in production.

            
None of these, on their own, were necessarily
bad developments. The independent-producer system fostered competition, which
theoretically should have increased efficiency. Creative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> were freer to
follow their hearts. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">studios</ENAMEX> started to look something like publishing
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">houses</ENAMEX>. You could argue, in fact, that the renaissance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX> movies
experienced in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1970s</TIMEX> was only possible because of these new
arrangements. But in the long run, the disappearance of steady revenue from
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">lower-cost</ENAMEX> productions and the lack of any permanent relationship between the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">studios</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> making the movies made high-priced gambling a
logical--if disastrous--choice. Because every film is a one-shot, everyone
involved has a stake in it being as big a shot as possible. This is hardly a
recipe for sustained growth. In the simplest terms, no one is doing long-term
planning because everyone's trying to make the next deal.

            Still, it's worth
remembering that, as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late as 1987</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">studios</ENAMEX> were still reaping huge profits.
It's only in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last 10 years</TIMEX>, in fact, that we've seen a meteoric rise in the
costs of both production and marketing. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> sense, this is the full
flowering of the death of the studio <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">system</ENAMEX> and the triumph of purely
speculative capitalism. In another sense, it's part of what's been called the
"<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">winner</ENAMEX>-take-all" society, where those on top <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">command</ENAMEX> more and more resources
and those in the middle tend to disappear. But what it isn't is a rational way
to run an industry. It's not commerce that rules in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX>. It's just
excess.
