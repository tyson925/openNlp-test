            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zinc</ENAMEX> has become the hot new
therapy for the common <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cold</ENAMEX>. Once just a weak-selling natural cold remedy
touted in health-food <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX>, it now sells to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pharmacies</ENAMEX> and
grocery <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX>. Does it work? Probably not. Does it sell? Ask the big
pharmaceutical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> whose immense resources are nurturing the
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all</NUMEX>-too-credulous market for unproven alternative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicines</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zinc</ENAMEX>, a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nutrient</ENAMEX> found in red <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meat</ENAMEX>, is known to be essential to growth and
immune-system function. It was not plugged as a cold remedy, however, until
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1979</TIMEX>, when a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> city <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planner</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Eby</ENAMEX>, became convinced that megadoses of
zinc improved <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">his 3-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leukemic daughter</ENAMEX>'s response to chemotherapy and
protected her from colds during treatment. While such anecdotes commonly spur
alternative-medicine fads, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eby</ENAMEX> took the admirable step of instigating a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1984</TIMEX>
clinical trial of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc lozenges</ENAMEX> that found the treatment cut the duration of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">colds</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>.

            
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zinc</ENAMEX> did not really sell, however, until the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer of 1996</TIMEX>, when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Annals of Internal Medicine</ENAMEX> published a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cleveland Clinic</ENAMEX> study with similar results. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> showing cold symptoms for
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX> or less were given either <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc</ENAMEX> or placebo lozenges. They were
instructed to dissolve <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> lozenge in their mouths every <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two hours</TIMEX> while awake,
until the symptoms were gone. Symptoms in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc takers</ENAMEX> disappeared after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.4</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>, compared with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7.6 days</TIMEX> for those in the placebo <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. The only problem
was zinc's bitter taste. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Eighty</NUMEX> percent of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who got zinc complained of
a bad aftertaste, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 percent</NUMEX> felt nauseated.

            Still,
the evidence for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc</ENAMEX> is equivocal. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eby</ENAMEX>'s initial trial stimulated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> other
studies, and while <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> found zinc worked, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> found it did not. Army
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tacoma</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wash.</ENAMEX>, recently pooled the zinc data for a comprehensive
"meta-analysis," published <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last month</TIMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Archives of Internal</ENAMEX>
Medicine . They found no benefit, concluding, "The evidence for
effectiveness of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc</ENAMEX> salts lozenges in reducing the duration of common colds
is still lacking." It is also unknown whether large doses of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc</ENAMEX> have toxic
effects in the long run.

            
Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> question whether it is even
biologically plausible that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc</ENAMEX> could cure colds. Zinc <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">backers</ENAMEX> propose that
the element's positive charge could a) bind it to viruses, blocking their entry
into the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> along your nasal tract or b) allow it to "clamp" nerves that
stimulate congestion. However, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Virginia</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researcher</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Gwaltney</ENAMEX>
pointed out that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">saliva</ENAMEX> does not reach the nasal tract, and
therefore cannot exert any of these effects. Furthermore, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc</ENAMEX> levels
needed to kill cold viruses in the test tube are far higher than anything the
lozenges achieve.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gwaltney</ENAMEX> and others believe
a placebo effect may account for the sporadic positive results from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc</ENAMEX>. It is
known that inert <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substances</ENAMEX> can alleviate symptoms in colds, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX>, sciatica,
and even congestive <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart failure</ENAMEX> through the power of suggestion alone. This
is not to say the symptoms are just in the mind, but rather that the mind can
generate beneficial biological effects. You might think that the fact that zinc
beat the placebo in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cleveland Clinic</ENAMEX> trial would rule out a placebo effect.
But a dummy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pill</ENAMEX> only works as much as you believe in it. Belief can be
affected by many factors, including the drug's appearance (certain pill colors
are more effective than others), form (injections often have a greater effect
than <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pills</ENAMEX>), or taste (bitter may seem like better).

            
The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc</ENAMEX> trials did not, for example, mask
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">zinc</ENAMEX>'s bitter, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX>-like flavor. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Zinc</ENAMEX> may work primarily because its
distinctive taste helps convince you that it will. This phenomenon has long
confounded research on vitamin C, which, after almost two-dozen studies, has
not been demonstrated to provide benefit in colds beyond its placebo
effect.

            
Nonetheless, publicity from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cleveland Clinic</ENAMEX> trial made the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quigley Corp.</ENAMEX>'s
Cold-Eeze <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc</ENAMEX> gluconate lozenges a runaway success. Quigley was a struggling
dietary-supplement <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> prior to the study: It's stock sold for less than a
dollar a share, and revenues for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first half of 1996</TIMEX> were just under
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$175,000</NUMEX>. The study's release boosted the stock to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$37</NUMEX> a share <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">overnight</TIMEX> and
has generated <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$41 million</NUMEX> in revenues in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year since</TIMEX>.

            
Subsequent revelations that the trial's lead
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researcher</ENAMEX> owned stock in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Quigley</ENAMEX> raised questions of biased results. On the
day that his article was published, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Macknin</ENAMEX> sold <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9,000</NUMEX> Quigley
shares for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$145,000</NUMEX> in profit. During the course of the study, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quigley</ENAMEX> gave
Macknin options for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an additional 10,000</NUMEX> shares. According to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cleveland</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Plain Dealer</ENAMEX> , however, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Macknin</ENAMEX> denied that this was a payment and said he
received the options after his results had already been compiled.

            Others
soon joined the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc</ENAMEX> rush. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nu-Wave Health Product</ENAMEX> introduced <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Cold-Rid</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sugar</ENAMEX>-free <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc lozenges</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Weider Nutrition International</ENAMEX> offers <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Cold-Free</ENAMEX> zinc
acetate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lozenges</ENAMEX>, which it claims have higher zinc concentrations. There is
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc gum</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc spray</ENAMEX>, even zinc lollipops. And now pharmaceutical giant
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner-Lambert</ENAMEX> has jumped in with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zinc Defense</ENAMEX>, a lozenge backed by a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">national TV</ENAMEX>-ad campaign.

            
If the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc</ENAMEX> story were an isolated anecdote, it
would be merely amusing. Thanks to misinformation unrivaled since the pre-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX>
patent-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX> era, however, alternative therapies have become a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$14 billion</NUMEX>
market, which is growing by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as much as 30 percent</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annually</TIMEX>. And now the big
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> want to cash in. In addition to its <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc pill</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this fall</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner-Lambert</ENAMEX>
introduced <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Celestial Seasonings</ENAMEX> lozenges with echinacea, a purple flower that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">herbalists</ENAMEX> promote without clinical evidence as a cold remedy and
"immune-system enhancer." <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Home Products</ENAMEX> plans to market ginkgo, saw
palmetto, and other herbal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">products</ENAMEX> under its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Centrum</ENAMEX> label. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SmithKline</ENAMEX>
recently announced plans for a herbal line that includes ginkgo, saw palmetto,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ginseng</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. Johnswort</ENAMEX>.

            As with
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">zinc</ENAMEX>, many of these remedies become popular solely on the basis of anecdotes,
testimonials, and equivocal studies. Health-food <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> often cite
traditional use by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Native Americans</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> herbalists as evidence. These
are terrific grounds for deciding to further test <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substances culled</ENAMEX> from
nature--some of which will surely prove valuable. But they are not good reasons
to tout them as cures--or even as safe.

            
What's most worrisome about the entry of the
big pharmaceutical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX> is that their large marketing budgets will expand the
respectability of these kinds of low-standard claims. Sure the big companies
are more coy in their pitches--the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hall</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Zinc Defense</ENAMEX> box says zinc "may"
relieve cold symptoms and, in small print, denies making any claim to treating
a health condition--but that only makes the sham more effective.

            So what does work for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">colds</ENAMEX>? Drinking plenty of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liquids</ENAMEX> keeps mucus flowing out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> and
carrying viruses with it. Trials show that over-the-counter combination
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">decongestant/antihistamines</ENAMEX> do help relieve nasal congestion and post-nasal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">drip</ENAMEX>. And when suffering from a bout of miracle-cure claims, try a healthy dose
of skepticism.
