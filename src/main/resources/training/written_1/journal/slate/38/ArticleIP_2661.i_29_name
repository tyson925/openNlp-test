            Among the last budget issues
settled by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</TIMEX> was the extension of federal
health insurance to uncovered <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>. Although the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branches</ENAMEX> were still
squabbling over the details <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at week's end</TIMEX>, they agreed to establish a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$24</NUMEX>
billion program financed by a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">15 cent</NUMEX> hike in the tobacco tax.

            The most surprising thing
about the deal is that it comes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three years</TIMEX> after the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> defeat of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s health care reform plan took the issue off the table. (Full
disclosure: I was a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinton</ENAMEX> health care policy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adviser</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992 to 1993</TIMEX>.) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hill</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> began warming to the idea of expanding health care coverage in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nancy Kassebaum</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ted Kennedy</ENAMEX> proposed a measure that
would ban <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">insurers</ENAMEX> from excluding pre-existing conditions and dropping coverage
when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> changed jobs. The bill passed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>, and as the roaring economy
filled government coffers with revenues, conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Orrin Hatch</ENAMEX> teamed
with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kennedy</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the spring of 1997</TIMEX> to co-sponsor his insurance-for-kids
program.

            One
reason the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> agreed to the deal was that it appealed strongly to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, not a natural <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GOP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">constituency</ENAMEX>. Another is that insuring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> is
much cheaper than insuring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>.

            But the success of the program will ride on the details,
which remain unclear. Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> who don't
have health insurance, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 million</NUMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nine-tenths</ENAMEX> of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> who work, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two-thirds</NUMEX> of them have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> who work full time.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">About a third</NUMEX> of the uninsured <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> hail from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> with incomes below
the poverty line (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">roughly $16,000</NUMEX> for a family of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>). Another <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> are from
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 100</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">200 percent</NUMEX> of poverty (earning <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between $16,000</NUMEX> and
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$32,000</NUMEX>), and the last <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> that earn more.

            For the poorest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>, the
state-run insurance program Medicaid helps. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> required <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicaid</ENAMEX>
to phase in coverage of all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> below the poverty line, along with a
hodgepodge of other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>, by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>. As of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>, all impoverished <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> under
age <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> qualify. But <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 2 million</NUMEX> of them haven't been signed up. (All of the
new proposals include <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$500 million</NUMEX> for aggressive outreach.)

            Despite the offer of matching
federal dollars, many <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> don't try to cover more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>: Only <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rhode</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Island</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vermont</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minnesota</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hawaii</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> subsidize coverage for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> up to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">200 percent</NUMEX> of poverty or more.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>
could have filled the gap by ordering the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> to cover uninsured <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> to the
higher income level. But given the current deference to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, this was never
seriously considered. Another option would have been for the federal government
to cover poor and uninsured <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> with a program like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX>, but this was way
too radical for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> contemplation.

            
Instead, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> agreed to dispense <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$24</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">billion</ENAMEX> in block grants to help the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> insure <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>. But will the states
spend all the money on insurance for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>? It's not clear. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX>
wanted rules that would prevent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governors</ENAMEX> from substituting the federal money
for existing state spending. But the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governors</ENAMEX> convinced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> to
negotiate for looser guidelines that let the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> pay for unpaid emergency
room and hospital bills--which the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> already cover--out of the block
grants. The final budget deal allows <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> to divert <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">up to 15 percent</NUMEX> of
child-insurance funds to these other purposes.

            In the budget negotiations,
nearly everyone agreed on providing health insurance at low or no cost to
uninsured <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> whose family incomes dip below <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">200 percent</NUMEX> of poverty. More
contentious was what the insurance would actually cover. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX>
wanted skimpy coverage, while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> wanted
coverage at least as good as the high-quality benefits enjoyed by federal
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>.

            To hold
costs down, the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$24 billion</NUMEX> program doesn't cover <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> who are currently
insured. This, of course, is a formula for failure. If the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> gives
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inexpensive</ENAMEX>, first-class insurance to the uninsured <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> of low-wage
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>, low-wage <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> enrolled in lousy insurance programs will rightly
feel cheated. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">insured families</ENAMEX> have inadequate child benefits, excessive
costs, or periods without coverage. To make matters worse, many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employers</ENAMEX>
looking to save money (and please their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>) will drop dependent benefits
if states provide better coverage than the private plans now do.

            What should the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> do? If the primary goal is to
make certain that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> with uninsured <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> have a fallback, then we
should keep the program cheap and cover just the services <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> don't get
without insurance--like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX> and preventive services. Such safety-net
insurance could provide good outpatient coverage and minimal hospital coverage.
This scheme is far from perfect, but uninsured <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> already get the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>
care they need when they're sick because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> pass unpaid costs along to
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> and private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">insurers</ENAMEX>.

            But if the primary goal is a
future where all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> are well covered, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> should stick with the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX>'s broad insurance benefits, but open the program to all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
below <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">200 percent</NUMEX> of poverty--even the currently insured. Because the new
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">budget</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$24 billion</NUMEX> is only enough to cover <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, a more
ambitious program that covered all of the uninsured and under-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">insured children</ENAMEX>
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> would cost much, much more.

            The budget
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">negotiators</ENAMEX> essentially punted on the issue. The plan gives states some murky
coverage options and rules limiting the program to the currently uninsured.

            
Many will decide on safety-net <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> coverage.
It would assist <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX>, although a working <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> earning <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$25,000</NUMEX> still could
face huge <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> bills that they will have to renege on. Other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> will
choose comprehensive benefits restricted to the uninsured. To discourage
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employers</ENAMEX> from simply dropping coverage, the recently uninsured cannot be
covered. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Families</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employers</ENAMEX> paying more for less insurance will yell and
scream. Support will wither. And <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> will scale back benefits.

            Alternatively, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> with
the best <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> benefits may go ahead and let the poorly insured switch to the
program. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Low-wage</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> will flock to the program, and federal money will run
out. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX> will come begging. Then <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> must either ante up or shut off a
popular new working-class benefit.

            Who said health care reform
is dead? <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> may be unwittingly creating the thin edge of the wedge that
brings major health care reform for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>.
