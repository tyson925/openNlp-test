            "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Food</ENAMEX> is
not the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boss</ENAMEX> in my life. I am stronger than the temptation of any <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX>."

            Then again, maybe not.
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> spend <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$30 billion</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> on weight-loss programs, but obesity resists
treatment more tenaciously than do viruses--<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90 percent to 95 percent</NUMEX> of people
who lose weight eventually regain it.

            Why is
that? We've learned much in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last few years</TIMEX> about the role that hunger plays
in obesity. Drug <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> have capitalized on that knowledge to create
powerful new appetite <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">suppressants</ENAMEX>. But these "cures" come with serious risks.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Researchers</ENAMEX> linked the popular diet-drug combination "fen-phen" to a rare heart
disease <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year ago</TIMEX>. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> continued to prescribe it to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX>, arguing
that the health risks associated with obesity justified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">fen-phen</ENAMEX>'s wide use.
Now reports of new <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart abnormalities</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> on fen-phen raise fresh
questions about using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pills</ENAMEX> for obesity before all the facts are in.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Scientists</ENAMEX> didn't always view appetite as a cause of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">obesity</ENAMEX>. The dominant thinking for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than two decades</TIMEX> was that the obese
gained weight because they burned fewer calories. In experiments, overfed or
underfed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">volunteers</ENAMEX> always returned to their original weight--the
"setpoint"--when they ceased their diets. Also, when obese dieters lost weight,
their metabolism slowed, conserving calories and driving their weight back to
the setpoint. It seemed that obese <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>'s only option was a combination of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">starvation</ENAMEX> and exercise, while skinny <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> got to feast and watch television.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late '60s</TIMEX>, amphetamine, which increases metabolism, became the rage for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dieters</ENAMEX>. But it didn't keep the weight off, and proved to be addictive.

            As it
turned out, thin <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> didn't have higher metabolic rates. On high-calorie
diets, they gained weight just as easily as obese <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. (In fact, obese
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> had to eat more to put on a given amount of weight.) The
metabolism of obese dieters never slowed enough to explain how quickly their
weight bounced back. They were also eating more. Put simply, even at their
baseline weight, obese <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> eat more than thin <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>.

            
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Swedish</ENAMEX> studies of pregnant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> demonstrate
this observation. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Women</ENAMEX> weighed about a pound more <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one year after</TIMEX> delivery than
at the start of pregnancy. Some gained more than a pound, and many returned to
their old weight. How were the gainers different from the non-gainers? Mainly,
they ate more total calories, especially in the form of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">snacks</ENAMEX>. Although
gainers ate lunch less often, their snacking increased to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three or more</NUMEX> times
per day.

            The study
also demonstrated another frustrating fact about setpoints--they're easier to
increase than decrease. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Experts</ENAMEX> believe that once you've put on extra weight
for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six months to a year</TIMEX>, the setpoint resets, as it does after pregnancy. To
permanently lower the setpoint, you must keep weight off for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about three years</TIMEX>,
perhaps longer. Until recently, nothing short of has kept the seriously obese
from eating as much as they want to.

            The big breakthrough in understanding obesity came in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX>,
when experiments on <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">lab mice</ENAMEX> revealed that the hormone <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">leptin</ENAMEX> controls the
setpoint by controlling satiety. When your weight falls, leptin decreases,
hunger increases, and you eat more--until you return to your weight setpoint.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">This year</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cambridge</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX>, found an inbred <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> whose
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> all lacked the gene for producing leptin. Without leptin to signal
satiety, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> in this family eat ravenously. The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2-year-old</TIMEX> weighs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">64</NUMEX>
pounds and the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8-year-old</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">189 pounds</NUMEX>.

            These
leptin findings imply that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormones</ENAMEX> and neurotransmitters control the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">instinctual</ENAMEX> desire to eat, overwhelming willpower in the process. In
evolutionary terms, this makes sense. The drive to find and eat <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> was
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">integral</ENAMEX> to the survival of our early ancestors. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> who gorged themselves
survived <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> famines and reproduced more than others. But this behavior
became "maladaptive" when access to round-the-clock <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hamburgers</ENAMEX> and ice cream
became the norm. Now, as we gain weight and push our setpoints upward, we are
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reprogrammed</ENAMEX> to eat even more.

            
The leptin breakthrough spurred efforts to
manipulate the brain's hunger <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>, a combination of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fenfluramine</ENAMEX> and phentermine--fen-phen--was shown to suppress appetite enough
to help the severely obese lose an average of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">24 pounds</NUMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</TIMEX>.
Fenfluramine increases the brain's serotonin levels (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Prozac</ENAMEX> does, too, but not
as dramatically) to produce a sense of satiety. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phentermine</ENAMEX> is a relative of
amphetamine that reduces hunger and increases metabolism. Not surprisingly,
when the obese <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> stopped taking these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>, their weights returned to
baseline levels. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fen-phen</ENAMEX> was the first drug therapy proven to reduce
weight over the long haul.

            Other
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> for the hyperhungry are on the way. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dexfenfluramine</ENAMEX> (tradenamed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Redux</ENAMEX>), a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cousin</ENAMEX> of fenfluramine, was just released. Sibutramine, with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">fen-phen</ENAMEX>'s effects
in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pill</ENAMEX>, and orlistat, which prevents fat absorption from the intestines,
are undergoing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Food and Drug Administration</ENAMEX> approval testing. Leptin analogues
(chemical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cousins</ENAMEX>) are also being developed. Effective hunger control will
probably require lifelong therapy with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> like these.

            The first warning that these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> could pose health risks
came <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year ago</TIMEX>, when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New England Journal of Medicine</ENAMEX> published an
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">article</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> linking fen-phen to a deadly cardiac disease
called primary pulmonary <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hypertension</ENAMEX>. The study suggested that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 23</TIMEX> and
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46</NUMEX> of every <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> taking fen-phen would die from the condition
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each year</TIMEX>. (At my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>, a young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> died from it after taking fen-phen
for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24 days</TIMEX> to lose weight for her wedding.) Yet, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New England Journal of</ENAMEX>
Medicine downplayed the risks at the time. It simultaneously published an
editorial speculating that fen-phen would save more lives by reducing obesity
than the associated <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart disease</ENAMEX> would kill.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">French</ENAMEX>
findings were basically ignored: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Eighteen million</NUMEX> prescriptions were filled for
fen-phen in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Physicians</ENAMEX> opened <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> and Internet
sites to do nothing but prescribe fen-phen, and weight-loss operations like
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jenny Craig</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nutri/System</ENAMEX> placed fen-phen prescription-writing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> at
the center of their programs.

            
Fen-phen consumption began to fall only this
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">month</TIMEX>, when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New England Journal of Medicine</ENAMEX> essentially withdrew its
earlier cost-benefit argument with the emergency release of startling new
fen-phen findings. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Researchers</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minnesota</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nebraska</ENAMEX> documented <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> cases of
unusual <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart-valve abnormalities</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> taking fen-phen. The average age of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> required valve-replacement surgery. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">This week</TIMEX>,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> reported <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">58</NUMEX> new cases of abnormal heart valves in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> on fen-phen,
and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal of the American Medical Association</ENAMEX> reported animal
evidence linking both dexfenfluramine and fenfluramine to toxic brain
effects.

            There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> reasons why
nobody should have bought the obesity-is-deadlier argument. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Obesity</ENAMEX>'s risks
come from high blood pressure, high <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart disease</ENAMEX>,
each of which can be controlled with safe <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicines</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) The mildly overweight
don't run these health risks, yet drug <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> are using results from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pounders</ENAMEX> to sell <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">140</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pounders</ENAMEX> who want to look good at the beach. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>)
Even in the seriously obese, we don't know that these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> really will save
more than they kill, because no studies have been done. (Meanwhile, the drug
lobby is blocking the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> from monitoring for bad outcomes after it approves
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>.)

            Fen-phen isn't our first
go-round with a miracle cure for obesity, and it isn't likely to be our last.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late '80s</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> inflated a balloon device in obese <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>'
stomachs. Because <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> couldn't eat nearly as much, they lost weight and
kept it off. But some of the balloons deflated and got stuck in the intestines.
Only after several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> died was the device pulled off the market. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dieters</ENAMEX>' craving for something to quiet their hunger is almost as great as
their craving for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX>.
