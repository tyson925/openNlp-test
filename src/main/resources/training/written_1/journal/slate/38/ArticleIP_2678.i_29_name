            When medical practice goes
wrong, who is to blame? The traditional answer in journalism has been
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">unambiguous</ENAMEX>: the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX>. If the press found out a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> had died from improper
care or had had the wrong leg cut off, the reaction was predictable. A clamor
went up for the incompetent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX>--or at least his license. And
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> everywhere cringed. There but for the grace of God go I, each of us
would say. For all of us make terrible mistakes. Only the unlucky few are
publicly exposed.

            So I've
been intrigued by the increasingly popular alternative explanation--"the system
did it." In many cases, this is the right way to go. Bad systems are more often
at fault than bad <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX>. I worry, however, that we have already begun to take
this explanation too far--so far that we are introducing a dangerous murkiness
into the question of who is ultimately in charge when it comes to taking care
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.

            Take the recent horror story in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher Sercye</ENAMEX>, a
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gunshot victim</ENAMEX>, lay bleeding to death <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">35 feet</NUMEX> from the door of a
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> while the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> refused to help, citing hospital policy
prohibiting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> from leaving the emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>. (If you somehow missed or
have forgotten the details, click .) The case provoked a national outcry. This
time the white-hot light of publicity focused blame more on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">administrators</ENAMEX>
than on individual caregivers. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">City</ENAMEX>, state, and national <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> demanded to
know how a medical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> could maintain such an appalling policy. In an
unusual step, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> personally announced that the policy was so
outrageous that he would seek to have the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ravenswood Hospital Medical Center</ENAMEX>
expelled from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX>.

            In this particular case,
however, the impulse to hold the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">CEO</ENAMEX> more responsible than the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> seems
wrong. What shocked me was not so much the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>'s policy as the fact that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurses</ENAMEX> would stick by the rules rather than help a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> in
desperate need. News <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> demanded an explanation from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">CEO</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Blair</ENAMEX>, but I could find no reports that mentioned so much as the name
of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staffer</ENAMEX> who had refused to help.

            This was
not an isolated instance of medical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> providing bad care in obeisance
to a policy. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los Angeles Times</ENAMEX> recently uncovered several cases in
which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northridge Hospital</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southern California</ENAMEX> refused to provide
epidural anesthesia during childbirth to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicaid</ENAMEX> unless they anted up
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$400</NUMEX> on the spot. The reason? It was "hospital policy," <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were told. One
patient offered credit cards, a check, and finally had her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> wire in the
money, but the epidural was denied. The cash hadn't arrived in time.

            
Certainly, these policies deserve scrutiny. But
the real issue here is who, ultimately, is in charge of patient care. By
putting all the blame on the rule <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">makers</ENAMEX>, the public is implicitly accepting
that sometimes the rule <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">makers</ENAMEX> are in charge instead of the caregivers. That is
a very recent phenomenon, and it should be resisted.

            Hospital
policies, after all, are not federal laws. They do not demand slavish devotion.
In odd cases, rules adopted for the best of reasons can make for bad <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX>.
And real life is full of odd cases. I remember <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> not long ago when, late at
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> came into my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> at death's door because of a rupturing
abdominal aneurysm. Understandably, our hospital forbids <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> to start
operations without an attending <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">surgeon</ENAMEX> present. But none was around, and this
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">guy</ENAMEX> would have died waiting. So we didn't hesitate to break the rules and
operate on our own. It was his only chance.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ravenswood</ENAMEX>'s policy may also have been well intentioned.
According to a hospital <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX>, it is an old policy maintained by most
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> to make clear that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> should not be expected to sacrifice the care
of sick <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> to go hither and yon. But the dying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> presented a
case where the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> should have broken that rule. (Indeed, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicago</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tribune</ENAMEX> reported that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year earlier</TIMEX>, an emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX> at a partner
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hospital</ENAMEX> with the same policy had done just that. He ran outside to help a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> suffering a brain hemorrhage in her <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>.)

            As for
just plain barbaric policies, like the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northridge Hospital</ENAMEX>, I see no way
in which the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> who follow them are not ultimately culpable. To say they
were obeying an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">administrator</ENAMEX>'s instructions is not even the slightest defense.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> still can (and should) insist on holding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> responsible for
providing proper care.

            
The managed care debate presents this issue in
a slightly different context. The recent clamor in the press and among some
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> to allow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> to sue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">insurers</ENAMEX> for medical malpractice makes it
sound as if we are going in the wrong direction here, too. But the semantics
are important. The laws under consideration would not actually make insurers
liable for malpractice . Instead, they would make it easier to sue
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">insurers</ENAMEX> for failing to pay for proper care. I'm all for giving patients
a fair chance to contest improper refusals of payment, but we should not lapse
into calling such refusals malpractice. Just because an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">insurer</ENAMEX> won't pay for a
treatment doesn't free a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> from providing it. Essentially, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> in
this position is uninsured. And <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> are still ethically obliged to offer
appropriate care to uninsured <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in need.

            This might sound like I'm
calling for a return to olden times, when medical decisions were nobody's
business except the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX>'s and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s. I'm not. That fragmented system
without oversight had its problems: deviance (not all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> provided good
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">care</ENAMEX>) and cost (the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> drove up the bills). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Hospitals</ENAMEX>, government
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">insurers</ENAMEX>, and private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">insurers</ENAMEX> have stepped in with standard guidelines for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">care</ENAMEX>, review of medical decisions, and changes in how <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> are paid. Much of
this systematization of care has clearly been to public benefit. But not all of
it has, and not all of it will be.

            At the
margin, we <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> have found ourselves being asked to do things that make us
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">queasy</ENAMEX>. A new guideline, for example, may tell us to send heart surgery
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> home <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX>. It forces us to justify doing otherwise. It's a big pain
in the butt. But it is not a command, and we should not let it become one.
Perhaps the previous way was based on nothing more than fusty old habit, and
being forced to rethink it is good for us. However, if I know the new way is
inappropriate, I cannot be permitted to cave. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX> and in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Northridge</ENAMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> should have known that blindly following policy was bad. The buck still
stops with them.
