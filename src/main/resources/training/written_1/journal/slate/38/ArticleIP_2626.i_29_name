            The headline appeared on the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reuters</ENAMEX> wire <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late Tuesday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>. "Stock plunge may dent <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Finnish</ENAMEX> growth."

            Great. Just when we thought
we were out of the woods, the damn <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Finns</ENAMEX> come along and throw everything
into turmoil again. And here we always thought they could take care of
themselves.

            Of
course, given the fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> trade with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Finland</ENAMEX>--indeed, with all of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scandinavia</ENAMEX>--amounts to something less than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.5 percent</NUMEX> of our <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> gross
domestic product, one would hope that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> fund <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> will be able to handle
this news without panicking. But then the events of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past week</TIMEX> have not done
much to inspire confidence in the rationality of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> stock market.
Take <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intel</ENAMEX>, for instance. When the market closed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> thought
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intel</ENAMEX>'s shares were worth <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$63 billion</NUMEX>. When it closed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX>, they thought the
very same shares were worth <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$72 billion</NUMEX>. God only knows what the news from
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Finland</ENAMEX> will mean.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX> is, of course, a much bigger and much more important
part of the world economy than is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Finland</ENAMEX>. Currency and equity-market turmoil
in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX> has had, and will continue to have, real effects on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>'s
real economy. In other words, it would be a mistake to dismiss
all <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX>' worries about the impact of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> sell-off
on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> as the fearful bleatings of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who, having read too many
silly headlines about globalization, suddenly decided--since everyone else
seemed to have decided, too--that the sky was falling. But it would not be a
mistake to dismiss most of their concerns as precisely that.

            There were
solid reasons for the sharp decline in the value of equities in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>
itself, most obviously the precipitous rise in interest rates and the
precipitous drop in liquidity as the central bank fights to keep the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HK</ENAMEX> dollar
pegged to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> dollar. Still, it's hard to see the drop in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> stock
market as much more than a classic--if short-lived--case of what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX>
call "herding." In a strange way, it seems clear that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> were looking for
an excuse to sell, not simply to lock in profits for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the quarter</TIMEX> but also
because the bull market had lasted too long and had risen too high. The odd
thing about this panic, after all, is how unhysterical the actual trading was.
Except for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the minutes</TIMEX> immediately following the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">half-hour</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">break Monday</TIMEX>, buy
and sell orders were easily matched up and there were no stories, as there were
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</TIMEX>, of market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX> simply refusing to pick up their phones and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trade</ENAMEX>. Everyone was racing for the exits, but they were doing so in an orderly
fashion.

            
The fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> in some way wanted the
bubble to burst, if only for a little while, can be seen also in the sense of
relief with which many on the Street spoke of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX>'s drop. It was as if, with
a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousand</NUMEX> points gone from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> could look at the market a
little more clearly and decide what they really thought. Of course, that
feeling of clarity disappeared almost immediately <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX>, as everyone suddenly
turned around and started racing for the entrances, but it must have been nice
while it lasted.

            Is it
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">cavalier</ENAMEX> to dismiss <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this past week</TIMEX> as a simple illustration that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>
sometimes act like <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sheep</ENAMEX>? Not really. (But then I would say that, wouldn't I?)
In the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> place, it's hard to see how even a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">600</NUMEX>-point drop in the Dow would
seriously affect the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> economy. Except for IPOs (first-time public stock
offerings), most <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> raise capital internally. The stock market
is, in that sense, almost purely a secondary market. And while it's never good
for consumer confidence to have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brokers</ENAMEX> jumping out of windows, short and steep
drops in the valuation of equities have nothing to do with the production of
real wealth. In the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> place, and perhaps more importantly, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX> isn't
important enough to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> economy to justify a sell-off like we saw
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX>.

            Now, that may seem like a dubious assertion, particularly
given the constant rhetoric about the global economy with which we are deluged
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coca-Cola</ENAMEX>'s persistent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">evocation</ENAMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.2 billion</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> who drink only
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coke</ENAMEX> each <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> but will drink <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cokes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each tomorrow</TIMEX>. But consider this:
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> GDP is now somewhere <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">close to $8 trillion</NUMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last year</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> exports to all
of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX> were <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$191 billion</NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">around 6 percent</NUMEX> of GDP. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Over a third</NUMEX> of all <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
exports do go to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX>, and that market has been growing rapidly in
recent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>. But it's still only of minor importance to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> economy as a
whole. And in any case, it's not as if <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX> has suddenly vanished from the map.
While growth rates throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southeast Asia</ENAMEX> are going to slow, those economies
are not in recession, which means they will still be buying, even if less than
before. If anything, the combination of currency devaluation and slower growth
in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX> should help the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> equity market by continuing to keep inflation low
and assuaging the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>'s concerns about an overheating economy (however dubious
those concerns might be).

            Having
said all that, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asian</ENAMEX> market undoubtedly is more important, in economic
terms, to large <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporations</ENAMEX> than it is to your local dry cleaner, and in
that sense the GDP-export comparison is deceptive. According to some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX>,
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a third</NUMEX> of corporate profit growth in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last fiscal year</TIMEX> came from exports.
So the rhetoric of globalization is not simply rhetoric. And that's especially
true for certain sectors of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> industry. As has been much (too much) remarked
upon, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> semiconductor-parts <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> do a lot of business with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asian</ENAMEX>
semiconductor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX>. If demand for computers dries up in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX>, those parts
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> will find it difficult to replace the business. The same may also be
true, on a smaller scale, of larger software and hardware <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> like
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intel</ENAMEX>. On the other hand, many of these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> have assembly
<ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> in the region. And if you can pay your bills in devalued ringgit and get
paid in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> dollars, you're generally going to be pretty happy.

            
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">multinationals</ENAMEX> have been feeling the sting
of the strong dollar for some time now, and the continued weakening of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asian</ENAMEX>
currencies will continue to hurt their profit margins. But it seems telling
that it was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX>, which has seen currency problems erode earnings for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</TIMEX>
now, that led <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX>'s rally by announcing it was going to buy back <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$3.5</NUMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">billion</NUMEX> of its own shares after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>'s stock dropped <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> points on
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX>. Share-buyback plans are sketchy as long-term business strategies, but
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX>'s assurance that its shares were undervalued suggests that it's not
particularly worried about the ultimate impact of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>'s woes. Of course,
there is always the chance that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>'s management has simply gone
mad.

            In
issuing what amounted to a public vote of confidence in the market, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> was
actually continuing a venerable tradition of Establishment attempts to quell
selling panics by intervening loudly and decisively. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October of 1907</TIMEX>, as the
stock market was melting down, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">J.P. Morgan</ENAMEX> went to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX> and compelled
them to dip into their reserves to offer loans that would allow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stockholders</ENAMEX> to
cover their margins and begin buying again. In the midst of the crisis, he sent
an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emissary</ENAMEX> to the floor of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Exchange</ENAMEX>, where the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> raised his hand,
quieting the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX>, and said, "I am authorized to lend <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$10 million</NUMEX>! There will
be enough for everybody!" And that, at least according to the story, was
that.

            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Twenty years later</TIMEX>, it was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">J.P. Morgan and Co.</ENAMEX> again. At
the start of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 1929</TIMEX> market slide, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> were dumping shares
as fast as possible, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Lamont</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morgan</ENAMEX> assembled a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">consortium</ENAMEX> of
investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bankers</ENAMEX> who committed themselves to putting <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$20 million</NUMEX> into the
market. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morgan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> came onto the floor of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Exchange</ENAMEX>, stepped
into the middle of the caterwauling mob trading in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Steel</ENAMEX>, and bid <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$205</NUMEX> for
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>'s shares at a time when the stock was already trailing well below
that. Like the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, this was a rather cinematic moment, but it didn't work
quite as well. Within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three years</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Steel</ENAMEX>, like the market, lost <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80 percent</NUMEX>
of its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1929</TIMEX> value.

            I suppose it's a measure of
how far we've come that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> just issued a press release, though it would have
been stirring to see <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">CEO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lou Gerstner</ENAMEX> storm into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Exchange</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> to start
buying up shares. In any case, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX>'s decision was obviously not as momentous as
either <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morgan</ENAMEX>'s or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lamont's</ENAMEX>, because they were dealing with genuine disasters
while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Blue</ENAMEX> was responding to a blip. Nor does <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Blue</ENAMEX> exercise the kind of
financial or cultural power that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morgan</ENAMEX> once did. But the announcement was
still a welcome slap in the face to a market that was hyperventilating for no
good reason at all. Or, rather, to a market that was hyperventilating for as
real a reason as there is: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Markets</ENAMEX> are made up of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> sometimes
get afraid. Even in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Finland</ENAMEX>.
