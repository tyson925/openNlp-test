            Should <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> be
treated just like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX>? <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">This week</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> argued that he should.
Unfortunately, they failed to get their message straight. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> different
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">camps</ENAMEX> advanced the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Watergate</ENAMEX> analogy in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different ways for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two</TIMEX>
different purposes. One camp's case is more persuasive, but the other's is more
exciting. And <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX> are exploiting the difference.

            The
Process <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Camp</ENAMEX>, led by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Judiciary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Hyde</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ill.</ENAMEX>, is using the
Watergate analogy to justify procedural rules for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> impeachment
inquiry. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hyde</ENAMEX> released an inquiry resolution, which, he noted,
"follows the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Watergate</ENAMEX> resolution, word for word." In a letter to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Judiciary Committee</ENAMEX>'s ranking <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrat</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Conyers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mich.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hyde</ENAMEX>
proposed that "the model for impeachment" should be "the one that you helped to
write in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1974</TIMEX>." <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hyde</ENAMEX> thinks that by following the rules of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Watergate</ENAMEX>
process, which were approved and administered by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX>, he can force
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX> to admit he's conducting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinton</ENAMEX> inquiry fairly.

            The more zealous <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Substance Camp</ENAMEX>, led by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Majority Whip</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom DeLay</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>, is using the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Watergate</ENAMEX> analogy to suggest not just that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> impeachment process should mirror the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX> impeachment process but
also that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s offenses are as serious as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX>'s. This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">camp</ENAMEX> hopes
constant comparisons between <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Watergate</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX> cover-up will cause the
former's gravity to rub off on the latter. If <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> has done "what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX>
did," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DeLay</ENAMEX> argued on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last weekend</TIMEX>, "that is impeachable."

            <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX> can't persuasively
rebut the process analogy. (In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1974</TIMEX>, for example, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Conyers</ENAMEX> opposed a preordained
time limit on the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Watergate</ENAMEX> probe. How can <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Conyers</ENAMEX> now demand such a limit on
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX> probe?) So instead, they're conflating it with the substance
analogy. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX>, when asked about the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Watergate</ENAMEX> inquiry rules, Conyers
replied, "The notion that this investigation should be open-ended like
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Watergate</ENAMEX> ... is preposterous," because "<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Watergate</ENAMEX> involved a wholesale
corruption of government which extended through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> and other
federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>. This matter involves the concealing of a private affair."

            Likewise,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Press Secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike McCurry</ENAMEX> argued, "The facts of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Watergate</ENAMEX> and
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monica Lewinsky</ENAMEX> matter are entirely different, and I think most <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>
would readily and quickly agree to that, which is why I went through a little
reminder about the enormity of the crimes committed during the period of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Watergate</ENAMEX>." According to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCurry</ENAMEX> arrived "armed for
a question about comparisons to <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Watergate</ENAMEX>. He got it, and almost ran out of
breath as he rattled off a lengthy list of the accusations against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX>,
including that he 'misused the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>, [and] the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Secret Service</ENAMEX>, to conduct
unlawful wiretapping of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> [and] maintained a secret <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> to violate the constitutional rights of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX>.' After pausing
slightly for air, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCurry</ENAMEX> added indignantly, 'So there's no parallel
whatsoever.' "

            
Once the process analogy is transformed into
the substance analogy, it loses its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX>. Yes, substantive analogies can be
drawn between <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX>'s offenses and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s, e.g., between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enemies List</ENAMEX>
and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> files or between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plumbers</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bimbo Eruption Team</ENAMEX>. But the
differences are more striking. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX> case--the only case presently
before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>--the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>'s objective was sex, not power. The underlying
sins were more personal than political. And the secret tapes and wires were
arranged not by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> but by his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enemies</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX>.

            The irony
is that it would have been so much easier to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">deem Clinton</ENAMEX>'s offenses
impeachable on their own terms. He has plainly lied under oath, for example. If
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> determines that this constituted perjury (which is somewhat more
technical), then <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> has committed a felony. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> could simply argue
that no <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">felon</ENAMEX> should be allowed to remain <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>. Instead, they're holding
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> to the impossibly high standard of corruption set by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX>. If, as
"<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Hyde</ENAMEX> recently pledged to do," the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> "applies the standard that
emerged in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1974</TIMEX>, it will decide that the charges against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> do not fall
under the articles of impeachment," argued <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Watergate-</ENAMEX>era <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Democratic</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">congressmen</ENAMEX> in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> op-ed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX>. They're right: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s offenses
aren't what the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Watergate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">committee</ENAMEX> meant by an impeachable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">offense</ENAMEX>. But that
comparison isn't what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hyde</ENAMEX> meant by the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Watergate</ENAMEX> rules, either.
