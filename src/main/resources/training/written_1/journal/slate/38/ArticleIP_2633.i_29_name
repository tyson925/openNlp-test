            When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Fisher</ENAMEX> came to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eastman Kodak</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX>, he brought with him a reputation for being a
technological visionary and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> who had figured out what it took to turn
a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> around. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fisher</ENAMEX>'s tenure at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Motorola</ENAMEX>, one of the great business
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">success</ENAMEX> stories of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last two decades</TIMEX>, had been marked by dramatic
improvements in quality, productivity, and innovation, capped by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Motorola</ENAMEX>'s
reinvention of the cellular-pager market. Similar feats were expected at
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Click</ENAMEX>.

            
Instead, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fisher</ENAMEX> has floundered. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">his first two years</TIMEX>, he did do an excellent
impersonation of a turnaround <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialist</ENAMEX>, ridding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX> of the nonfilm
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX>--<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eastman Chemical</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sterling Winthrop Drug</ENAMEX>--that it had acquired
during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the days</TIMEX> when conglomeration was all the rage. But unlike such figures
as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Welch</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GE</ENAMEX> or the late <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike Walsh</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tenneco</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fisher</ENAMEX> has not been able
to turn <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX>'s "core competence"--as the management <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">theorists</ENAMEX> would say--into
a consistent moneymaker. On the contrary, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX>'s near-monopolistic control of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> film market has been steadily eroded by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fuji Film</ENAMEX>'s consistently lower
prices. Meanwhile, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hewlett-Packard</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Canon</ENAMEX> have moved strongly into the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">digital</ENAMEX>-camera market, which seems to be the future of photography as a
whole.

            As a result, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX> has had
to lay off <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>, and just recently announced yet another
restructuring plan. More tellingly, perhaps, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fisher</ENAMEX> has devoted an inordinate
amount of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>'s attention to its price war with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Fuji</ENAMEX>. After <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fuji</ENAMEX> cut
prices by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as much as 30 percent</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last summer</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX> began making noises about
charging its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">rival</ENAMEX> with "dumping" film here. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX> had already spent much of
the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last two years</TIMEX> pressing a case before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Trade Organization</ENAMEX>. It
charged <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> with illegal trade practices that kept <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX> out of consumer
markets there and gave <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Fuji</ENAMEX> a "profit sanctuary" which allowed it to accept
lower margins on its sales in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>.

            Although the actual
financial implications of the case were not huge, the psychological investment
that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX> had put into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTO</ENAMEX> charges was immense. That this was a tactical
error was made clear <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this month</TIMEX>, when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTO</ENAMEX> vindicated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Fuji</ENAMEX> on all counts.
Instead of seeming like a minor blow, the decision was portrayed as powerful
evidence that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fisher</ENAMEX>'s magic had failed him. But while dreaming of a trade
victory to solve fundamental business problems seems like a dubious recipe for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">success</ENAMEX>, there's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> important thing to remember: That was exactly the recipe
that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fisher</ENAMEX> had learned while he was at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Motorola</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cl</ENAMEX> ...
Out of film.

            
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fuji</ENAMEX> case was, as innumerable press
accounts have pointed out, the most important case to come before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTO</ENAMEX> in
its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</TIMEX> of existence. Unfortunately for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX>--and for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supporters</ENAMEX> of free
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trade</ENAMEX> in general--it was also a case involving issues that seemed to fall just
outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTO</ENAMEX>'s jurisdiction. The trade <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> was created in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX> as
the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> leg of the world financial order, along with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monetary Fund</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Bank</ENAMEX>. But while the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTO</ENAMEX> clearly has the authority
to rule in tariff cases and quota cases, it doesn't seem to have authority over
cases involving more subtle restraints on trade, primarily those created by
arrangements between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> rather than by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX>. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Click</ENAMEX> for more on
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> role in that restriction.)

            The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fuji</ENAMEX> case dealt with the tightly interlocked relationship between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fuji</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">distributors</ENAMEX> of photographic film and paper, all of whom
sold Fuji exclusively. Now, even under traditional antitrust law exclusive
relationships are not necessarily illegal, since they make production and
distribution more efficient. And clearly consumer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> are constantly in
search of such arrangements. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McDonald's</ENAMEX> sells only <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coke</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martha Stewart</ENAMEX>'s
sheets and towels are sold only at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kmart</ENAMEX>. Department <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> often fashion
exclusive relationships with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designers</ENAMEX>. Nonetheless, by being frozen out of the
wholesale distribution market, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX> has been frozen out of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>'s consumer
market as well, particularly since <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> has a law restricting the number of
large retail <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX>.

            
The problem is that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX> really had little
evidence to show that it was being frozen out by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japanese</ENAMEX>
government . There was the retail<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">-stores</ENAMEX> law, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX> produced evidence
of state intervention to restrict imports, but it was evidence from the 1960s
and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1970s</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fuji</ENAMEX> pointed out that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX> had a larger market share in some
regions of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> than in others, and that at different points in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the last two</TIMEX>
decades <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX>'s market share actually fluctuated quite sharply. If what we're
dealing with is a monopoly situation, then it's an imperfect monopoly at best.
Given the limits on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTO</ENAMEX>'s jurisdiction, it was probably unreasonable of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX> to expect a real victory.

            In a
sense, though, what's most striking about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTO</ENAMEX> case is not that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX> lost,
but that it put so much energy into winning. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX>'s history in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> is
actually a complicated one. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s and 1970s</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> altered the
tint of its film to correspond to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> notions of skin tone (and I realize
how weird that sounds), and also invented film that could be developed in
normal light because so few <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">photographers</ENAMEX> had darkrooms. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1980s</TIMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX> opened a major research <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX>, staffed with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineers</ENAMEX>,
and started a joint venture in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canon</ENAMEX> made copiers sold under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX>
name. The truth about the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> market has always been that it is
penetrable, but only after tremendous effort. At <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> point, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX> appeared to
be making that effort. But even as it lost focus in its sales efforts at home,
it lost focus abroad.

            
We've become so accustomed to hearing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> complain about foreign competition that it's easy to see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX>'s
post-defeat recriminations as just more whining. But even if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTO</ENAMEX> had to
rule as it did, the decision was a blow against open markets and seems likely
to increase protectionist sentiment at home. Still, there is something about
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX> suit that smacks of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> relying on a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> to do the work it
couldn't do itself. If you're looking for reasons why, consider the
transformation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Motorola</ENAMEX>, from which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fisher</ENAMEX> came to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX>. It was
accomplished not merely through technological innovation or total quality
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>, but also through the remarkably effective lobbying efforts of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>.

            Under
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">CEO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Galvin</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-1980s</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Motorola</ENAMEX> got protection from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japanese</ENAMEX>
dumping for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> semiconductor industry. It got the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> administration
to negotiate telecommunications agreements with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> that were then used to
ensure <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Motorola</ENAMEX>'s access to the cellular market there. And it got the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trade</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> to impose retaliatory tariffs on <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> cellular
products until impediments to entering <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> markets were lifted. These
political interventions were essential ingredients in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Motorola</ENAMEX>'s rebirth as a
high-tech <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>.

            
The point is not that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Motorola</ENAMEX> was on the wrong
side of these questions, although dumping accusations too often mean, "They're
selling better-quality products cheaper." The point is that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Motorola</ENAMEX> only got
its way by relying on a kind of military-industrial-complex approach to trade.
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Click</ENAMEX> for more details on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Motorola</ENAMEX>'s campaign.)

            Surprisingly, though, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fisher</ENAMEX>
seems not to have recognized how important <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Motorola</ENAMEX>'s high-powered lobbying
efforts were to its success in the trade wars. As a result, he threw <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX> into
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTO</ENAMEX> case while failing to see how much it mattered that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX> couldn't
stack the deck the way <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Motorola</ENAMEX> had. And in a sense, it's this failure to grasp
the specificity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX>'s present problems, this inability to separate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX>'s
circumstances from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Motorola</ENAMEX>'s, that's characterized all <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fisher</ENAMEX>'s efforts over
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past two years</TIMEX>. The past casts shadows on him that are too long.
