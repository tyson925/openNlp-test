            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Kurlak</ENAMEX> cannot leap tall
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> in a single bound, but he can single-handedly make stock prices rise
or fall. Micron, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intel</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texas Instruments</ENAMEX>--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kurlak</ENAMEX> has brought them all down and
picked them all up in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past year</TIMEX>. Every time he issues a public statement,
in fact, the market moves. The reason is simple: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kurlak</ENAMEX> is the most important
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sell</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">side analyst</ENAMEX> in the semiconductor industry at a time when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> have
become perhaps the most important <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> on Wall Street.

            "<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX>'s selloff began
when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill Lynch</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Kurlak</ENAMEX> downgraded his earnings estimates for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Micron</ENAMEX>." "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Kurlak</ENAMEX> told <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> in a conference call that
he expects <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intel</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> earnings to come in below an earlier <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lynch</ENAMEX> estimate of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">92 cents</NUMEX>. That sent shares of the world's largest chipmaker
tumbling <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 1/16</NUMEX>." "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Micron Technology Inc.</ENAMEX> jumped <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4-3/8</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> on positive
comments from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill Lynch</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Kurlak</ENAMEX>." These quotes are from just the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">past three months</TIMEX>. Go back further and you can collect many more, all
reflecting the same strange fact: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kurlak</ENAMEX> changes his mind all the time, but
every time he changes it the market responds.

            In and of
itself, this might seem just an odd--perhaps cultlike--phenomenon. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kurlak</ENAMEX>
is no kook. He has been at the job for well over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a decade</TIMEX> and has been an
Institutional 
               Investor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Team All America</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX>--no
kidding--<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> different times. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kurlak</ENAMEX> is simply an extreme example of Wall
Street's new reality, which is that no one has as much influence as the people
who supposedly know where a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>'s stock price is going to go.

            Securities <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> were relatively unimportant on Wall
Street before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s</TIMEX>, but their rise to power has not been sudden. As early
as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1977</TIMEX>, when the stock market wallowed in the doldrums, Wall Street chronicler
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Sobel</ENAMEX> observed that a successful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> could "become something of a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">celebrity</ENAMEX>, called by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX> ... invited to seminars in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">resort areas</ENAMEX>, and asked to submit articles
to trade and related <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publications</ENAMEX>." By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1984</TIMEX>, when the bull market was just
beginning, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> were being called "minigods"; and by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 1980s</TIMEX>, top
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> were pulling down salaries in the high <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> figures, although they were
still a long way from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Masters</ENAMEX> of the Universe terrain then reserved for
bond <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> and deal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">makers</ENAMEX>.

            Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past few years</TIMEX>,
though, the dramatic upsurge in money pouring into the market and the resultant
pressure on institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> to improve their performance have sharply
increased the value of anyone with a clue about what's going to happen to the
pharmaceutical industry--or to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemicals</ENAMEX>, or to semiconductors. At the same
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>, growth in the market for financial news has made <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> public figures.
Daily newswires are filled with announcements of upgrades and downgrades from
brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>, while market-wrap articles often cite <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX>' reports not
as commentary but as news in their own right.

            Finally,
and perhaps most importantly, the sharp expansion in the market for initial
public offerings and secondary stock offerings has made it essential that
brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> who are well respected in their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">field</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Corporations</ENAMEX>, sensibly enough, do not want their stock offerings underwritten
by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> whose recommendations will carry little weight with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX>.

            
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>, Wall Street <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX> took home <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">nearly $3</NUMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">billion</NUMEX> from underwriting IPOs, which means that winning or losing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two or three</NUMEX>
big deals can be the difference between a great year and a bad one. And that
has meant that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> are now often valued as much for their rainmaking
abilities as for their predictive expertise. Top <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> now spend far more
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> on the road, trying to drum up business, while much more of the actual
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">analytical</ENAMEX> work is being done by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">junior analysts</ENAMEX> back at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>. Not
surprisingly, since <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> are now crucial figures in the underwriting
business, their compensation has tripled over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last three or four years</TIMEX>.
According to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institutional Investor</ENAMEX> , top <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> who follow hot sectors
make <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">well over $1 million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX>, while most senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> bring home more
than <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">half a million dollars</NUMEX>. Though <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> are still not as highly paid as
investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bankers</ENAMEX>, the gap is much narrower than it was in the early
1990s.

            As a
result, the vaunted <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> Wall between the underwriting and research
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">departments</ENAMEX> of Wall Street <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> has become a fiction. While there's no
evidence that direct pressure is brought to bear on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> to paint rosy
pictures of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>'s prospects, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporations</ENAMEX> expect what's called
"after-market support" from their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">underwriters</ENAMEX>. This is a polite way of saying
that they don't want to be hung out to dry by a "neutral" or "sell"
recommendation <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two months</TIMEX> after they go public.

            Some conflict has always been inherent in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX>'s
role. <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Houses</ENAMEX> that are bearish are not <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> that get a lot of underwriting
business. And issuing a "sell" recommendation has a way of making a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>'s
management unfriendly, which in turn may limit an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX>'s access to
information in the future. It's perhaps not surprising, then, that a recent
study showed that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> issue "buy" recommendations <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> times as often as
"sell" recommendations.

            We are, of
course, in a bull market, which means that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> should have been
recommending that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> buy more often than they sell. Even so, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX>'
recommendations have manifested the Wall Street equivalent of grade inflation.
"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Neutral</ENAMEX>" is generally understood to mean "sell," "outperform" to mean "your
call," and "accumulate" to mean "you might want to buy it if you have extra
money lying around." I think "buy" still means "buy," but then some <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> use
"strong buy," so who knows?

            
This has had paradoxical consequences. Even as
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> have become more able to move stock prices, their more
corporate-congenial language has probably diminished the long-range
impact of their recommendations--with so many "outperforms" and "accumulates"
out there, it's hard to know which ones to take seriously. In the short
term , however, the effect has been to increase price volatility, especially
when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> issue "strong buy" or "sell" recommendations. Knowing that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> can now move the market, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speculators</ENAMEX> jump in and out. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kurlak</ENAMEX> cuts
his rating on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intel</ENAMEX>, what matters is not that he's right or wrong about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intel</ENAMEX>'s
prospects but that his cut in the rating will drop the stock regardless.

            Why should this concern
anyone outside Wall Street? The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> reason is that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> are essentially
unaccountable for their recommendations. No one says: "We can't quote this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX>.
He's been wrong <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> times on this stock." So their ability to move
stock prices--which, in theory, encourage efficient capital allocation--is
troubling. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>, more important answer is that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> are crucial
contributors to short-term thinking. Their issuing of "short-term buy" or
"short-term hold" recommendations obviously intensifies pressure on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">companies</ENAMEX>
to meet and beat earnings expectations at all costs. When you <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> that
reality with an overly narrow definition of "shareholder value," you end up
with a corporate world that must privilege <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next quarter</TIMEX> over the next
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decade</TIMEX>. Which somehow doesn't seem to be the best way to prepare for the next
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decade</TIMEX>.
