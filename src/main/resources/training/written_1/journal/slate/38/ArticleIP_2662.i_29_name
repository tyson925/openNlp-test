            When a motorcyclist was hit
broadside by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> on a local <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ambulance</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> stabilized his neck and
back and whisked him over to the nearest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX>--a suburban for-profit
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hospital</ENAMEX>. The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35-year-old</TIMEX> construction <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX> had multiple fractures, including
to his vertebra. Though the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> did every X-ray and blood test in the book,
they somehow overlooked the critical step of keeping him flat to protect his
fractured spine. They did, however, figure out that his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HMO</ENAMEX> preferred he be
treated at another <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>. So they transferred him to a local nonprofit
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hospital</ENAMEX> where I sometimes work. He arrived sitting up in his stretcher,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cringing</ENAMEX> in pain and risking paralysis.

            It was
probably an honest mistake. But I was disturbed that the transferring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>
was so thorough with tests and so lax with basic care. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurses</ENAMEX> with me
blamed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>'s for-profit status. Driven by the almighty dollar, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">center</ENAMEX> was slick at doing billable tests but had slashed staffing to the point
that it couldn't provide good care. "I wouldn't take my <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> to that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>,"
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurse</ENAMEX> said.

            For-profit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX> now own <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 percent</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>.
They say they are transforming a bureaucratic industry into an efficient
provider of better quality care. But the expanding federal investigation of
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$20-billion</NUMEX> hospital <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">giant</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia/HCA</ENAMEX> raises concerns that the pursuit of
profits is leading to fraud and poor care.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Investigators</ENAMEX> believe the
company overstated costs and deliberately ordered unnecessary tests to increase
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> payments. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last month</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> midlevel <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> were indicted for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">criminal fraud</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> raided <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>. Rep.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pete Stark</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Calif.</ENAMEX>, who sparked the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX>, points to previous scandals as
evidence that for-profit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> will cheat <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">insurers</ENAMEX>, avoid the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">needy</ENAMEX>, and
sacrifice quality to produce profits. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A decade ago</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paracelsus Health Corp.</ENAMEX> was
forced to drop kickbacks for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> who sent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> to its
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last few years</TIMEX>, several for-profit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> have paid steep
fines for dumping uninsured <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> on other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">This February</TIMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> forced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sutter Hospital Corp.</ENAMEX> to return <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1.3 million</NUMEX> in fraudulent
billings.

            In the
most outrageous case, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> accused <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Medical</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enterprises</ENAMEX> of paying "bounty <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hunters</ENAMEX>" to obtain <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> for its psychiatric
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>. Its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> then gave wrong diagnoses to increase billings and held
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> as young as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> against their will until their insurance ran out. NME
pleaded guilty and paid <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$379 million</NUMEX> in penalties. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last month</TIMEX>, under its new
name, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tenet Healthcare Corp.</ENAMEX>, it paid <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">over $100 million</NUMEX> to settle patient
claims. Yet, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tenet</ENAMEX> is now the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>-largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX>.

            
For-profit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> defend themselves
fiercely. They argue that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) nonprofits face the same scandals, too. (Indeed,
they point out, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inspectors</ENAMEX> are investigating <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozens</NUMEX> of prestigious university
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> for fraud. So far the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Jefferson</ENAMEX>
University medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> have paid <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">over $40 million</NUMEX> to settle charges of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">double-billing Medicare</ENAMEX>.) And <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) the affluent suburban <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> they have
bought never had much charity care in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> place, so what's with the
"dumping needy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>" charge?

            On
quality of care, they ask, where's the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beef</ENAMEX>? There are anecdotes, like <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mine</ENAMEX>, of
poor treatment, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> admit there's no evidence that for-profit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>
compromise quality. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> study of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">214,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> records found no differences
in death rates between for-profit and nonprofit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> in the for-profit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital business</ENAMEX> are stupefied
when asked to defend profit in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX>. "It may come as a surprise to you, but
your <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> is made by a for-profit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>. Every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> is a for-profit
operation. Every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> is for-profit," says Wall Street health-stock analyst
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ken Abramowitz</ENAMEX>. "Health care is no different from buying a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>." Competition
will produce increased efficiency and better quality in health care, just as in
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX>.

            But health
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">care</ENAMEX> is not like buying a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>. You can shop around for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>, but the
motorcyclist I saw couldn't choose his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>. Also, it's much harder to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> whether your care is good than whether your <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> is good. Terrible things
happen to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> all the time: infections, bleeding, and other
complications of care. Studies show a quarter of these events are avoidable,
but it is rarely obvious to patients which ones are. If the motorcyclist,
delirious with pain and a severe blow to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX>, had lost <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sensation</ENAMEX> in his
feet, he wouldn't have known if we could have prevented it. He had to trust
with his life that making money was not our priority. (He did fine, by the way.
He'll wear a full-body brace for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six weeks</TIMEX>.)

            
For-profit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>, however, face intense
pressure to make money the top priority. They must answer to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stockholders</ENAMEX>
demanding rising profits, while nonprofit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> answer to a charitable
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX>. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boards</ENAMEX> do run <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> like for-profits. But a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> is nothing
like Wall Street. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> sees you once a month and tells you to do better for your
own good. The other holds a gun to your head <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX>.

            The ways
to make profits are limited. In theory, for-profits are equipped to do it
through greater efficiency--economies of scale, easier closure of failing
operations, and better access to capital. But hospital <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultant</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry Lewin</ENAMEX>
finds no evidence for-profits are more efficient. Indeed, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">58 percent</NUMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia/HCA</ENAMEX>'s beds lie empty, compared with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35 percent</NUMEX> of nonprofit beds.
Another way to generate profits is to buy up <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> cheap--though regulation
and competition have made it harder to lowball purchase prices.

            For-profits also keep billings up by avoiding the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">uninsured</ENAMEX>, sticking to affluent suburbs, and avoiding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">obstetric</ENAMEX>, pediatric, and
emergency services. Charity care at for-profit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> that of
nonprofit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>. But with for-profit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX> buying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tulane</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">George</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> university medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> and other big city <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>, these
tactics won't be available much longer.

            And, of course, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>
have squeezed as much profit as possible out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">insurers</ENAMEX>, billing for
everything they can. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia/HCA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> had targets of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 percent</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>
percent annual growth in charges. They even tried to make profits on blood
provided by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Red Cross charities</ENAMEX>. Increasingly, however, managed-care insurers
and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> are refusing to go along.

            Ultimately, that leaves one
alternative--cutting corners on care. And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NME/Tenet</ENAMEX>'s "bounty <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hunters</ENAMEX>" show how
far care providers may be willing to go.

            Medicine never used to be
like this. For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a long time</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">insurers</ENAMEX> gave <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> carte blanche to run up
charges. Some did. But the dominant professional ethic to do right by patients
kept most from exploiting the system. For-profit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> have no ethic beyond
making a buck. Their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> are imbibing that spirit. That's what worries
me.
