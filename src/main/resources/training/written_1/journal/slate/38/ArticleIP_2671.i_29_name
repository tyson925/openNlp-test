            Banning an obscure technique
like partial-birth abortion would seem to be a rather modest goal for
anti-abortion <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> faced with the most sympathetic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> they have had
since <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Roe vs. Wade</ENAMEX> . But the issue could change their fortunes. That's
because, as a medical technique, nothing makes partial-birth abortion
fundamentally different from other forms of late-term abortion. Certainly it is
no more grisly. If pro-choice <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> help pass the ban, their case for
allowing other late-term procedures will be fatally weakened. But good policy
on abortion would not focus on techniques at all--or even on when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fetus</ENAMEX> can
survive outside the womb. It would hinge on the question of when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fetus</ENAMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> becomes a perceiving being.

            Pro-life
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocates</ENAMEX> offer a seductive argument: Whatever you think about abortion in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">general</ENAMEX>, partial-birth abortion is just too ghastly to permit. As <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Republican</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Committeeman Tim Lambert</ENAMEX> argues: "It is really not about abortion.
It's about infanticide, it's about a procedure so gruesome the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Medical</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Association</ENAMEX> is opposed to it." Now even strongly pro-choice <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> see
this as a no-brainer and may provide enough votes to override <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">President</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s veto of the ban.

            In general, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">obstetricians</ENAMEX> told me, their choice of abortion
method depends mainly on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fetus</ENAMEX>' size. During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first eight weeks</TIMEX> of
pregnancy, when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fetus</ENAMEX> is very small, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX> like methotrexate and
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RU-486</ENAMEX> can safely make the uterus slough the placenta and gestational sac. In
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, however, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">obstetricians</ENAMEX> usually use "vacuum aspiration,"
which can be performed through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 15 th week</TIMEX>, while the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fetus</ENAMEX>'s head
is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">less than an inch</NUMEX> in size. They insert a suction tube through the cervix and
suck out the sac and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fetus</ENAMEX> along with it.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> are generally
comfortable with this. They don't like it, they wish it had never come to this,
but they don't identify with, in antiseptic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> argot, the "products of
conception." According to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alan Guttmacher Institute</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one-fourth</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
pregnancies are aborted--<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">around 1.4 million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institute</ENAMEX> estimates
that a whopping <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">43 percent</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> will have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> abortion by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 45</TIMEX>.
Almost all abortions--<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">94 percent</NUMEX>--are done by the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15 th week</TIMEX> of
pregnancy, predominantly by vacuum aspiration.

            But <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>
percent--<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 80,000</NUMEX> abortions--are done after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15 weeks</TIMEX>, and several
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundred</NUMEX> of these are done after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24 weeks</TIMEX>, commonly taken to be the point of
viability. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fetus</ENAMEX> is now too big to fit into the suction tubing. A <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20-week</TIMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fetus</ENAMEX> is commonly <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6 inches</NUMEX> long or more.

            
Why do <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> wait so long before seeking an
abortion? Sometimes, they have no choice. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Women</ENAMEX> who abort because of a fetal
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">abnormality</ENAMEX> don't find out about the problem until quite late: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amniocentesis</ENAMEX> to
collect fetal chromosomes for analysis generally is done at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18 weeks</TIMEX>. A few
late abortions are done for the mother's health, to save her, for example, from
possible disaster caused by an infected uterus or a newly diagnosed <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart</ENAMEX>
condition. Most of the time, however, they are elective. Often, the mother
didn't know she was pregnant. "The power of human denial is unbelievable," one
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">obstetrician</ENAMEX> told me. It's not at all uncommon, he said, to see <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> go
through an entire pregnancy without realizing it, come to the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> with a
stomachache, and turn out to be in labor.

            The usual
options for late-term abortion are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) induced labor and delivery or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2</NUMEX>)
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dilatation</ENAMEX> and evacuation. For induction--used in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 15 percent</NUMEX> of
cases--labor is stimulated with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>. Delivery usually takes from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36 to 48</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>, but it can take even longer. Sometimes, before delivery,
the obstetrician injects the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fetus</ENAMEX> with a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> that stops its heart. If not,
the heart sometimes beats even after the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fetus</ENAMEX> has been delivered. Even without
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> from its barely formed lungs, I'm told, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fetus</ENAMEX>'s heart can continue
beating for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes and even hours</TIMEX>.

            <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">About 80 percent</NUMEX> of late-term abortions are done by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">E.</ENAMEX> A couple of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> ahead, small, absorbent rods are put in the pregnant
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">woman</ENAMEX>'s cervical opening to expand it gradually. Then, for the actual
procedure, she--and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fetus</ENAMEX>--are given heavy sedation or general anesthesia.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> breaks her bag of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> and drains out the fluid. The opening won't
let the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fetus</ENAMEX> out whole. So the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> inserts metal tongs, physically crushes
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX>, and dismembers the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fetus</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pieces</ENAMEX> are pulled out and counted to
confirm that nothing was missed.

            Partial-birth abortion is, if
anything, less grotesque. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fetus</ENAMEX> is delivered feet <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>. To get the large
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> out, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> cuts open a hole at the base of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fetus</ENAMEX>'s skull and
inserts tubing to suck out the brain, which collapses the skull. Often, but not
always, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fetus</ENAMEX> is injected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lethally</ENAMEX> beforehand. The procedure is used for a
very small percentage of late abortions, and nothing makes it especially
necessary over <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">E.</ENAMEX> In fact, none of the obstetricians I talked to had even
heard of the technique until it became a hot political topic. It seems hardly
anyone uses partial-birth abortion, and if it's banned, almost no one will miss
it.

            That
partial-birth abortion is rare and inessential makes it easier, no doubt, for
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMA</ENAMEX> and pro-choice <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arlen Specter</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Minority Leader</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Daschle</ENAMEX> to back the ban. But they insist that they
stand by the right to any other <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>-term abortion. If partial-birth abortion
is too gruesome to allow, however, it is hard to see how other late abortions,
especially <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Es</ENAMEX>, are any different. And that's the inevitable next target
for pro-life <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocates</ENAMEX>.

            
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grossness</ENAMEX> is not a good objection. Lots of
operations are gross--leg amputations, burn surgery, removal of facial tumors,
etc. But that does not make them wrong.

            What
makes a late abortion disturbing is that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fetus</ENAMEX> is big now--like a fully
formed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> of my obstetrician <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>, both strongly pro-choice, told me
that, even when it is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>'s life at stake and abortion is absolutely
necessary, doing the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> and E feels "horrible." We imagine, as we look in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fetus</ENAMEX>'s eyes, that there is someone in there. And if there were, any elective
late abortion--even by induction--would be wrong, though <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E</ENAMEX> and
partial-birth abortion would seem especially cruel.

            Is there "someone in there"? The legal debate after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roe</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">vs. Wade</ENAMEX> has led us to focus on whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fetus</ENAMEX> is viable--whether it can
survive outside the womb. But knowing whether we have the technology to keep it
alive doesn't answer our question.

            I face the
same question when I have a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> on life support. His heart may be beating
and his lungs may be breathing, but that doesn't tell me whether he is a living
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> anymore. What I want to know is whether his brain has ceased
functioning. Likewise, in the case of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fetus</ENAMEX>, it seems that what we want to
know is whether it has a brain with the spark of consciousness. For example, we
don't view anencephalics, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">babies</ENAMEX> tragically born with only a brain stem and not
the rest of the brain, as living <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>. Even for viable anencephalics, there's
no purpose to providing treatment. We let them die.

            
Whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fetus</ENAMEX> is in the womb or out, big or
small, does not matter, either. But the size and appearance of the late-term
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fetus</ENAMEX> make us imagine that it has become a sensate, aware <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">creature</ENAMEX>--and makes
many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supporters</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-trimester abortion uncomfortable with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later</TIMEX>-term
ones.

            It's not clear when the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fetus</ENAMEX> can perceive, but it is doubtful that it can before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22 weeks</TIMEX>. That's the
earliest time anatomic studies give for the first sensory fibers reaching the
early brain. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25 weeks</TIMEX>, however, neonates show complex facial reactions to
stimuli that reflect higher brain--possibly conscious--activity. Somewhere
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 22 and 25 weeks</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fetus</ENAMEX> does become a distinctly different being. We
need more in-depth study to identify this critical juncture. That's because
most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> would feel that it is wrong to do elective abortions--abortions
when the health of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> is not at risk and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fetus</ENAMEX> is not seriously
deformed--beyond that point. The current debate glosses over these issues.
There's no good reason to single out partial-birth abortion--or any technique.
From the pro-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lifers</ENAMEX>' standpoint, banning it will not actually save a single
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fetus</ENAMEX>. And for abortion-rights <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supporters</ENAMEX>, it is only an invitation to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inconsistency</ENAMEX>.
