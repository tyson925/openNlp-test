            I pretty much ignored the
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> reports <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this summer</TIMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> were getting food poisoning from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX>
O157:<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">H7 bacteria</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hamburgers</ENAMEX>. I might have raised an eyebrow when beef
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">supplier Hudson Foods</ENAMEX> recalled <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">25 million pounds</NUMEX> of hamburger. But when the
recall caused <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Burger King</ENAMEX> to run out of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">burgers</ENAMEX>, I started to worry. Shouldn't
somebody do something about this food poisoning thing?

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Media</ENAMEX> apparently
agreed. Within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> of the recall, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> , the Wall
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Street Journal</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek</ENAMEX> , and others were proposing a simple
solution: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Irradiation</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> to kill not just <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> but all the nasty germs
and parasites that slip into our food supply.

            This
rapid blanket approval of irradiation by the establishment naturally stirred my
suspicions. We are talking about radioactivity, after all. On closer
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inspection</ENAMEX>, however, food irradiation turns out to work safely and effectively,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponents</ENAMEX>' concerns notwithstanding. But questions remain about whether food
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">poisoning</ENAMEX> is such a big problem in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> place.

            Human skin and intestines crawl with ordinary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX>. But
a few uncommon strains of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>--especially the notorious <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX>
O157:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">H7</ENAMEX>--produce toxins. Ingest these toxic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>, and you experience watery
<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diarrhea</ENAMEX> and severe abdominal pain at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, bloody stools next. You're
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">miserable</ENAMEX>, but these symptoms don't usually require medical attention--at
least, in developed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>. But in some cases, the toxins trigger the
destruction of blood cells and cause <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">renal failure</ENAMEX>. This "hemolytic uremic
syndrome" can be deadly in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Centers for Disease Control</ENAMEX> estimate
that toxic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> cause <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25,000</NUMEX> cases of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to 100</NUMEX> deaths each year
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Meat</ENAMEX> is
the most common source of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli O157</ENAMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H7</ENAMEX>, but raw <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetables</ENAMEX>, and fruit
juice have carried it in recent outbreaks. (You may recall that toxic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX>
showed up in <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">alfalfa</ENAMEX> sprouts <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two months ago</TIMEX>, and in Odwalla apple <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">juice</ENAMEX> last
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>.) The bug lives in the guts of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 1 percent</NUMEX> of cattle and contaminates
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meat</ENAMEX> when digestive contents spill where they shouldn't during slaughter. It
also contaminates produce if farm waste-water enters the irrigation supply.
Toxic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> are just one of the top <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> bacterial food contaminants. More
common <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">salmonella</ENAMEX> (present in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60 percent</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chicken</ENAMEX>) and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">campylobacter</ENAMEX> (the number one cause of food poisoning), cause <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diarrhea</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">million to 4 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each year</TIMEX>. However, washing your produce and
cooking your <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meat</ENAMEX> until well done will almost always remove these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>.

            
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Burger King</ENAMEX> terminated its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hudson Foods</ENAMEX> supply
contract not for safety concerns but for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PR</ENAMEX> reasons. Like other fast-food
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">chains</ENAMEX>, it cooks its <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">burgers</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">over 155 degrees</NUMEX>, killing all <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>. But it
feared that it might earn a reputation for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria burgers</ENAMEX>, which has plagued
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Box</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> ever since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX>, when <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> ate some of its
undercooked, tainted <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beef</ENAMEX> and died. (Ironically, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hudson Foods</ENAMEX>, primarily
chicken <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">suppliers</ENAMEX>, didn't distribute <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beef</ENAMEX> until <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Burger King</ENAMEX> talked them into
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few years ago</TIMEX>.)

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Advocates</ENAMEX>
of food irradiation say that a rare <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">burger</ENAMEX> doesn't have to be dangerous.
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Irradiators</ENAMEX> containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cobalt-60</ENAMEX> or another radioactive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">source</ENAMEX> would bombard
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hamburger</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">apple juice</ENAMEX>, and other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma rays</ENAMEX>, killing resident
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> and parasites. The radiation disrupts <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>, which germs need to
survive. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meat</ENAMEX> doesn't need functional <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>, since it's already dead.) Lower
doses will pasteurize <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX>--i.e., kill the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">disease-causing organisms</ENAMEX>. Higher
doses of radiation will completely sterilize <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Supporters</ENAMEX> of irradiation like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Rhodes</ENAMEX> argue
that the process is perfectly safe, leaves no funny taste or appearance, and
prevents illness from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli O157</ENAMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H7</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">salmonella</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beef tapeworms</ENAMEX>, fish
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">parasites</ENAMEX>, and trichinae in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pork</ENAMEX>. Since fungi are killed, radiation-pasteurized
food lasts <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">longer</TIMEX>, too--<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">up to two weeks</TIMEX> in the fridge instead of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few days</TIMEX>.
For <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma ray</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fans</ENAMEX>, food irradiation is the most logical step after heat
pasteurization of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk</ENAMEX>.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Food</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drug Administration</ENAMEX> has approved irradiation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">produce</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pork</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">poultry</ENAMEX>, and
other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX>, but industry has not adopted it widely. (For unclear reasons, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> has stalled on a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX> application to allow the industry to irradiate beef
and veal.) You'd think that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">poultry</ENAMEX> industry, which has suffered terrible
publicity over <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">salmonella outbreaks</ENAMEX>, would rush to irradiation, but it fears
that the negative public reaction to irradiation would be worse. Currently,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">astronauts</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> eat
irradiated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX>.

            
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Advocates</ENAMEX> blame slow adoption of irradiation on
technophobic lobbying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> that ignore the evidence and stir public fears
with outrageous claims that the process makes <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> radioactive. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> I
spoke to, however, offered credible arguments. Most admit that irradiation
works, and some, like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Jacobson</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center for Science</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Public</ENAMEX>
Interest, will even concede it's safe for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX>. But they argue that it's
expensive, harmful to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> and the environment, and unnecessary if safer
farming methods are practiced. They suggest growing <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">livestock</ENAMEX> under cleaner,
less confined conditions to prevent contamination of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">feed</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>;
slaughtering the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> so <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>-containing skin and feces never get on
food; and using simpler technologies, like steaming, to clean raw <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meat</ENAMEX>. As
environmental <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Colby</ENAMEX> told reporters, "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Irradiation</ENAMEX> is a cop-out.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Irradiation</ENAMEX> is saying we have to have fecal matter in our <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hamburgers</ENAMEX>."

            For the
record, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX> rays do not make food radioactive. And studies do seem to show
it's safe. In a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six-year</TIMEX> study, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> fed <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> and other animals
irradiated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chicken</ENAMEX> and found no evidence of increased <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> or other toxic
effects. Other research found no signs of hazard in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> who eat irradiated
food. Also, studies showed that, at the lower, pasteurization doses, radiation
does not degrade nutrients. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Health Organization</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Medical</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Association</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Dietetic Association</ENAMEX> all back the technology as
safe.

            What about the other arguments against irradiation? It
doesn't seem expensive--they use it in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bangladesh</ENAMEX>, after all. A <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> company
charges <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4 cents</NUMEX> a pound for irradiation, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocates</ENAMEX> say wider use would
halve costs. The risks to the environment and to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> seem theoretical. The
same technology is already used safely in hospital radiation-therapy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> that sterilize medical products. Food <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">irradiators</ENAMEX> do produce radioactive
waste that must be stored under nuclear regulatory guidelines, but the current
regulations governing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> and sterilization <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> seem to work, and
the amount of radwaste generated is far too small to cause <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Three Mile</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Island</ENAMEX>-like effects. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Advocates</ENAMEX> like to point out that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waste</ENAMEX> hasn't killed
anyone, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> die <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every year</TIMEX> from food poisoning.

            
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Irradiation</ENAMEX> also seems more cost-effective than changing farming and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">slaughtering</ENAMEX> practices. It's pretty hard to keep feces out of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meat</ENAMEX>. Some meat
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">producers</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sweden</ENAMEX> do, but their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meat</ENAMEX> is double or even triple the usual
price. And even with clean practices and technologies like steaming of meat
(which hasn't been tested nearly as much), some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> would still be
contaminated. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Advocates</ENAMEX> say there'd still be reason to irradiate.

            
So <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">irradiating food</ENAMEX> seems safe, effective, and
cheap. Yet it also seems like a high-tech swatter for an overhyped fly. Toxic
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli infect</ENAMEX> just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. Thanks to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> who pushed for
a recall, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hudson</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hamburgers</ENAMEX> didn't kill anyone. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Irradiation backers</ENAMEX> exaggerate
food poisoning's impact, claiming the top <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> contaminants kill <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9,000</NUMEX> people
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each year</TIMEX>. According to the most recent data, though, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fewer than 1,000</NUMEX> people
die from tainted <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> each year. Compare that with, say, car accidents, which
kill <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX>, or smoking, which kills <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 400,000</NUMEX>.

            Food poisoning is a serious
risk only for vulnerable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>, like the very young. For the rest of us,
it's an uncommon annoyance caused mainly by inadequately cooked <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chicken</ENAMEX> or
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pork</ENAMEX>. I'm not against saving <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a few hundred</NUMEX> lives a year for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a few pennies</NUMEX> extra
on my <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beef</ENAMEX>, so go ahead and zap my <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX>. But irradiated or not, I'll still
order my <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">burgers</ENAMEX> rare.
