            At this point, why don't we
just line tobacco <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> up against the wall, gun them down, and
then blow up all the cigarette <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factories</ENAMEX>? It'd certainly be more cathartic for
the anti-smoking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX>, and probably less painful for the tobacco industry,
than the farcical death by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a thousand</NUMEX> cuts process that's currently underway in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">R.J. Reynolds Chairman</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven Goldstone</ENAMEX> probably wouldn't opt for the firing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">squad</ENAMEX>. But his
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pronouncement</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</TIMEX> that the deal now being worked over in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> is
"dead" probably signals the final collapse of tobacco industry support for a
settlement that once promised to serve the interests of both <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-</ENAMEX>tobacco
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> and the industry. <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">That $368.5 billion</NUMEX> settlement, agreed to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last June</TIMEX> by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">R.J. Reynolds</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philip Morris</ENAMEX>, and their smaller kin, would have ended most
tobacco advertising, raised the price of cigarettes by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than 50 cents</NUMEX> a
pack, given the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Food and Drug Administration</ENAMEX> authority to regulate nicotine,
committed the industry to reducing teen smoking, and established a trust fund
to pay for past health claims and help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">smokers</ENAMEX> quit. Other than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX>
provision, these were all voluntary agreements on the part of the industry,
which made them in exchange for protection against class action suits and
punitive liability.

            The
settlement was negotiated with a group of state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys general</ENAMEX> who were
already suing or planning to sue the tobacco <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> to recoup <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicaid</ENAMEX> costs
for the treatment of dying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">smokers</ENAMEX>. But the national <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> of the
settlement--particularly the protection from liability--meant that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> had
to ratify it. And after some delay, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">commerce committee</ENAMEX> last
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> approved a revised version of the agreement. The provisions regarding
advertising, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX>, and teen smoking are pretty much the same, if a little
tougher, while the price tag has been raised to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $500 billion</NUMEX>. In
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">exchange</ENAMEX>, the tobacco <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> get ... well, nothing. The protection from
punitive damages and class action suits is gone, replaced only by a cap on the
amount the industry has to pay <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every year</TIMEX>. If this is a settlement, so was the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Versailles Treaty</ENAMEX>.

            It is, of course, difficult to feel sorry for the tobacco
industry, if only because it spent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than 30 years</TIMEX> lying about what it knew
to be true, namely that nicotine was addictive and that smoking caused lung
<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>. But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> tobacco bill is nonetheless a preposterous piece of
legislation, predicated on the concept that the industry has near total control
over whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> smoke or not. It's a bill for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who want to ban
cigarettes but don't have--or aren't willing to spend--the political capital it
would take to do so. Moreover, parts of it are either unconstitutional or
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">unworkable</ENAMEX>, since the bans on advertising would have to be agreed to by the
industry, which at this point doesn't really have an incentive to agree to
anything. And yet what's really odd about the whole affair is that the tobacco
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> really have no one to blame but themselves.

            What I
mean by that is not the obvious point, which is that if these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> didn't
make products that kill <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, they wouldn't be in trouble. What I mean
instead is that the commerce committee bill is, in a sense, the result of the
collision between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Tobacco</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> great obsessions: lying and shareholder
value. And it's the industry's commitment to both that's got it into this
mess.

            
If you want to pick a moment when a punitive
law against <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tobacco</ENAMEX> became almost inevitable, it might very well be that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day four years ago</TIMEX> when <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> tobacco <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> went before a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> committee
and said that nicotine was not addictive. This was injudicious of them,
considering that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">as early as 1963</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brown & Williamson</ENAMEX>'s general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counsel</ENAMEX> had
written in a memo, "We are in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX> ... of selling nicotine, an
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">addictive drug</ENAMEX>." As a symbol of industry arrogance and deceit, you'd have to
search far and wide to find a better example than the photo of those <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">execs</ENAMEX>.

            Of
course, they were simply doing what the industry has done ever since the late
1950s, when it became clear both that cigarettes were bad for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and that
the nicotine in them was addictive. Instead of admitting what almost everyone
believed, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Tobacco</ENAMEX> insisted on complete denial. Initially, this strategy
made a certain amount of sense from a business angle. Until the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">surgeon</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">general</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1964</TIMEX> report, and until warnings went on cigarette packs, admitting
that cigarettes were dangerous could have opened the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> up to consumer
fraud as well as product liability charges.

            After their packs began carrying warnings about the hazards
of smoking, though, it was hard to see how anyone could argue that the tobacco
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> were deceiving their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> (though, certainly, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> after
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> has tried). And yet the tobacco industry persisted in its strategy.
Instead of being honest about smoking's dangers and then arguing that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>
should be allowed to choose their own poison, the industry hid. And in hiding,
it left itself with no real protection against the prohibitionist impulse. (For
more on how the industry booted its "informed choice" argument, click .)

            If the
decision to lie took away the industry's ability to make a plausible case for
individual choice, its obsession with shareholder value made it believe that
only a massive settlement could solve its problems. Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philip Morris</ENAMEX> is
an enormously profitable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>, its stock price has remained relatively
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">deflated</ENAMEX>, because <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> were so concerned that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> might lose a
massive class action lawsuit somewhere down the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>. Signing an agreement that
would protect the industry from such suits would boost the stock price
immediately, even if that agreement cost <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">hundreds of billions of dollars</NUMEX>. In
other words, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philip Morris</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">R.J. Reynolds</ENAMEX> would make fewer dollars, but each
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of those dollars would be valued more highly by the stock market.

            
"Shareholder value," which is shorthand for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX>' obsession with their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>' stock prices, has become the prism
through which most of corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> now sees business. This has had some
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">beneficial</ENAMEX> effects, but in the case of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tobacco</ENAMEX>, it pushed the industry into a
settlement it could not control. It's possible that these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> believed
that their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lobby</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> was so strong that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> would ratify any
deal. But if so, this was self-delusion on a really impressive scale.

            In the history of tobacco
litigation, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">plaintiff</ENAMEX> had ever been awarded any damages, and those
were compensatory rather than punitive. Save for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jury</ENAMEX>, whenever
juries have been asked whether the tobacco industry is liable for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">smoker</ENAMEX>'s
health problems, they've decided that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">plaintiff</ENAMEX> knew what the risks were
and chose to ignore them. Given that, there's a real argument to be made that
the tobacco <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> should have just continued to litigate on a case-by-case
basis. They were spending obscene amounts of money on litigation--as much as
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$750 million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX>, by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> account--and the strain of wondering if this case
would be the one that broke the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX> couldn't have made working at these
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> much fun. But next to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$500 billion</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$750 million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> looks like a
bargain. And as time went on, the case for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tobacco</ENAMEX>'s liability would have grown
weaker, since public awareness of smoking's hazards has grown stronger.

            It's
possible, of course, that the cost of losing a major class action suit or one
of these <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicaid</ENAMEX> suits was just too enormous to chance. But what seems
clear is that the desire to get a higher stock market valuation, combined with
a history of refusing to defend itself honestly, pushed the tobacco industry to
the negotiating table. And there--in no small part as a result of that
history--it has found itself with very little leverage. For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35 years</TIMEX>, Big
Tobacco never gave <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">an inch</NUMEX>. It's not really surprising that when it finally
did, its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foes</ENAMEX> realized they could take a mile.
