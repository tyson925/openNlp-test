            They remain some of the most
evocative images of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1970s</TIMEX>, those film clips of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sheiks</ENAMEX> clad in flowing robes
and luxuriant headdresses, striding confidently from hotel <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lobbies</ENAMEX> into waiting
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">limousines</ENAMEX>, secure in the knowledge that in controlling <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two-thirds</NUMEX> of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">world</ENAMEX>'s oil reserves, they controlled the lifeblood of the industrialized
world. This was what the revenge of the Third World looked like, it seemed.
Every new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPEC</ENAMEX> meeting, every new increase in the price of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX>, spelled an end
to Western hegemony.

            Well,
maybe not.

            When <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPEC</ENAMEX> met at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of last month</TIMEX> and decided to
expand its production quota by <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2.5 million barrels</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a day</TIMEX>, the announcement was
front-page news, but the contrast with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPEC</ENAMEX> meetings of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two decades ago</TIMEX> could
not have been sharper. Instead of a tightly disciplined cartel administering
prices to a supine world market, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPEC</ENAMEX> more closely resembles a fractious trade
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> struggling to bring supply in line with demand even as its efforts
are sabotaged by its own <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>. And instead of being the sole <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ruler</ENAMEX> of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">world</ENAMEX>'s oil fields, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPEC</ENAMEX> has watched its control of world prices disappear, as
dramatic technological advances in exploration and production have made new oil
reserves--largely controlled by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Western</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>--appear where there weren't
any before. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPEC</ENAMEX>'s production decisions still make a splash on the spot-price
and futures markets, which have also been roiled by the announcement that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX>
will be allowed to resume its oil-for-food sales. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">splashes</ENAMEX> are all they
are.

            In part,
that's simply because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPEC</ENAMEX> has proved incapable of successfully restricting its
output. The most recent quota increase, for instance, will raise the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cartel</ENAMEX>'s
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> production to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">27.5 million barrels</NUMEX>. But most estimates suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPEC</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> are pumping out <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">28 million barrels</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a day</TIMEX> already--the quota increase
is designed mainly to allow to bring its share of the world market more in sync
with its enormous capacity. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saudis</ENAMEX> could single-handedly depress the market
by flooding it with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX>, as they did in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</TIMEX> in order to discipline
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">recalcitrant OPEC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>. But cutthroat price competition is generally not a
textbook recipe for profitability.

            
Neither, on the other hand, are artificially
high prices, the other reason for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPEC</ENAMEX>'s fall from grace. In the short run, the
massive price increases of the early and then <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late 1970s</TIMEX> brought huge windfall
profits to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPEC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> (and, to a lesser extent, to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Western</ENAMEX> oil <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>
that still handled much of their production). But those price increases
ultimately provoked <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> predictable responses: Demand for oil shrank, as
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> looked for substitutable sources of energy; and, more importantly,
the search for oil expanded. When <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPEC</ENAMEX> raised its prices far above its
production costs, it made sense to develop fields that previously had been too
expensive. If <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> suddenly decided to charge <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$5</NUMEX> for a
pint of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cow</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk</ENAMEX>, you can bet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">supermarkets</ENAMEX> would start selling <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk</ENAMEX> from
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> if they could get it here at a reasonable cost.

            Actually,
that analogy doesn't really capture just how momentous the technological
transformation of the oil industry has been. The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last decade</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a half</TIMEX> has
witnessed a steady decline in the cost of finding and producing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX>.
Three-dimensional seismic computer modeling now allows <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineers</ENAMEX> to discern
previously undiscoverable oil and gas deposits. The development of horizontal
drilling, where drill bits actually go sideways from a vertical hole in order
to extract more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX>, has also helped make the exploitation of smaller and less
accessible fields cost-effective. All this has meant that the world's "proven
oil reserves" (fields ready for production) are <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60 percent</NUMEX> larger now than in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1980</TIMEX>. The latest craze is even more astounding: Thanks in part to federal tax
breaks, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> are embarking on deep-water drilling <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">projects</ENAMEX> in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gulf</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> that involve taking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">fields</ENAMEX> that lie as much as a mile
underwater. It's got to the point where the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief economist</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venezuela</ENAMEX>'s
state oil <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> can say with a straight face, "Our reserves are--for all
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">intents</ENAMEX> and purposes--infinite."

            The infiniteness, of course, is imaginary. Although <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> is
a commodity, it's still not a commodity like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX>, which, thank God, we will
have with us always. At some point the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> will run out. But that point
now seems so far in the future that oil <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> are acting as if it will
never arrive, and that has had a major impact on their attitudes toward
production. If your reserves are finite, after all, you need steady price
increases over time to justify leaving any <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> at all in the ground.
(Otherwise, every <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">producer</ENAMEX> has an incentive to drain all its reserves, take the
money, and reinvest it in a more profitable enterprise.) That means restricting
supply. If your reserves are infinite, though, it makes sense to worry less
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about</NUMEX> price and more about maximizing output, since your source of cash is
never going to dry up and force you into another line of business.

            The
problem, of course, is that--as with overcapacity everywhere else--if everyone
maximizes output, everyone loses, because the price falls precipitously. The
oil market is especially sensitive even to a hint of expansion or contraction
in supply. When <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX> killed the market in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</TIMEX>, sending oil prices down
by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two-thirds</NUMEX>, it did so while expanding the world's <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> supply by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">just 3</NUMEX>
percent. Oil-futures <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> may not look like <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sheep</ENAMEX>, but those were baaas I
heard the last time I walked by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Mercantile Exchange</ENAMEX>, where the
futures are swapped. And that helps explain why <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPEC</ENAMEX> continues to struggle to
keep its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> in order and maintain a public production quota. It wants to
keep prices high enough to ensure profits but low enough to deter the
development of new fields. But the instruments it has to do this with are blunt
compared with the authority it wielded <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two decades ago</TIMEX>.

            
Mocking futures <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> may be fun--actually,
it is fun--but they have been crucial figures in the eradication of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPEC</ENAMEX>'s ability to dictate prices. Before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1980s</TIMEX>, there was no futures market
in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX>, nor even a real spot market for crude oil. (A spot price is the price
for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> cargo of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX>, generally delivered within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a month</TIMEX>.) That made it
difficult for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> to compare prices and locked them into relationships
with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producers</ENAMEX>. It also meant that there was no way to hedge against future
price increases, which obviously gave <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producers</ENAMEX> tremendous leverage. The rise
of the futures market and the broadening of the spot market brought price
competition to the world of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX>. Now, it's still rather difficult to put a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rig</ENAMEX>
in the middle of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gulf of Mexico</ENAMEX>, and the largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">producers</ENAMEX> do still exert a
disproportionate impact on the market as a whole. But, for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time in
history, there is now a relatively open market for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX>. And that undoubtedly
has something to do with the dramatic expansion of the industry's
productivity.

            Of course, it is an open
market that depends upon the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Sixth Fleet</ENAMEX> to protect it. But then that's
why I said "relatively."
