            The craziest idea coming
out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Viagra</ENAMEX> frenzy is that it's somehow scary and wrong for health
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">insurers</ENAMEX> to limit reimbursement for the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX>. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">insurers</ENAMEX> will pay for the
erection wonder <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pills</ENAMEX> only for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> who are tested by a urologist and proved to
have organic--not psychological--erectile dysfunction. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">insurers</ENAMEX> are also
limiting the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pills</ENAMEX> they will pay for to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each month</TIMEX>, some even
fewer, and a few none at all.

            
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Commentators</ENAMEX> on talk shows and news programs are incensed by the limits
(although no one yet complains that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicaid</ENAMEX> programs are likely to refuse
reimbursement altogether). "Get the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">insurers</ENAMEX> out of our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedrooms</ENAMEX>!" is the
rallying cry. But not so fast. As <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael O'Leary</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard</ENAMEX> urologist and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX> on sexual dysfunction, told the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> , "I'm not
convinced that it's a God-given right to have an excellent erection."

            
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Viagra</ENAMEX> is just the latest in the boom of
"quality of life" technologies that aim to enhance--rather than save--lives.
Such treatments as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Viagra</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Propecia</ENAMEX> for hair loss, and fertility treatments
pose a distinct problem for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">insurers</ENAMEX>. True, the treatments address biologically
caused problems, but ones that are hardly incapacitating. Still, there is no
clear distinction between these <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disorders</ENAMEX> and such accepted medical problems as
<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">acne</ENAMEX> or vitiligo (a disorder of skin <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pigmentation</ENAMEX>). If severe enough, even
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">wrinkling</ENAMEX> or hair loss can be considered medical problems. So these new drugs
erode accepted distinctions between worrisome abnormalities and the normal
variations of human life. While the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> push in one direction, the insurers
push in the other.

            Before
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Viagra</ENAMEX>, the hoist and pull <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mechanics</ENAMEX> of previous impotence
treatments--inflatable penile implants, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caverject</ENAMEX> erection injections, and
vacuum devices--made them unattractive to most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>, impotent or not. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Viagra</ENAMEX>, by
contrast, is simple and offers discretion. Instead of creating erections on its
own, it amplifies the signals <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> already have. (The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mechanics</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Viagra</ENAMEX> have been widely reported. Click for a reminder.) The results in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">impotent</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> are better, longer lasting erections and more satisfying sex.

            
These effects might also occur in perfectly
able <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>. Some are already seeking the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> in the hope that they can sustain
repeat performances--and they're filing claims. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HMO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> even had a
claim from a young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> for a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Viagra</ENAMEX> prescription he had procured to enhance his
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">wedding-</ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> performance. At the very least, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">insurers</ENAMEX> should be allowed to
distinguish these kinds of claims from others.

            Tougher
cases became evident to me during a visit I made to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O'Leary</ENAMEX>'s urology <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinic</ENAMEX>.
That <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX>, some <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two dozen</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> ranging from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21 to 86 years of age</TIMEX> were
lined up for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Viagra</ENAMEX>. I joined him in seeing a few. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> bashfully left
the impotence literature and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Playboy</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazines</ENAMEX> in the examining rooms
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">untouched</ENAMEX>. (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O'Leary</ENAMEX> is one of the few <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> who can take a tax deduction
for pornography.) But the urologist didn't beat around the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bush</ENAMEX>. "Are you here
for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Viagra</ENAMEX>?" was his opening question to each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>. Everyone replied yes,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">seeming</ENAMEX> relieved to have the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> raise the subject.

            
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>, I'll call him <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Davis</ENAMEX>, was
around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60</TIMEX>, obese, and hadn't had sex with his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> in over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three years</TIMEX> because
of difficulty getting erections, a problem almost certainly related to his
<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>. At some age, most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> would say impotence is normal. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">As many as 30</NUMEX>
percent of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">65-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and probably over <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 percent</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">75-year-olds</TIMEX> are
unable to "obtain and/or maintain a satisfactory erection for intercourse."
Before <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Viagra</ENAMEX>, many weren't quite ready to accept their decline, but few were
ready to accept the treatments. Sex wasn't important enough. So, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">insurers</ENAMEX> were
happy to let <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> define for themselves whether their impotence was worrisome or
not. Now a little blue <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pill</ENAMEX> might do the trick. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Davis</ENAMEX> wasn't sure if he was
willing to pay <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$10</NUMEX> a pop. But he figured his insurance would cover it, so why
not give it a try? <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Davis</ENAMEX> was a walking demonstration of every <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">insurer</ENAMEX>'s
nightmare.

            We don't
think <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> should have to worry about cost when deciding whether to undergo
treatment for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX>. But for the life-enhancing technologies,
there's nothing wrong if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">insurers</ENAMEX> say that, at some point, cost should come
into play. If <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Davis</ENAMEX> is willing to pay <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$10</NUMEX> for, say, a bottle of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> but not
for sex, why should the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">insurer</ENAMEX> pay? If these expensive new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> were free,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> would demand amounts out of all proportion to the value they actually
place on them.

            
But quality-of-life <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> have social side
effects that are potentially more troubling than the cost strains. The sneaky
thing about <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Viagra</ENAMEX>, for example, is that it's so straightforward it makes
not treating <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">impotence</ENAMEX> seem as strange as not treating <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pneumonia</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Viagra</ENAMEX>
lowers the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX> on what's medically abnormal. Indeed, all the quality-of-life
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> do. In a current ad barrage, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturers</ENAMEX> encourage <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to "ask your
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX>" about <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> for unsightly nails. The prescription skin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cream Renova</ENAMEX> is
hawked for wrinkles. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bristol-Myers Squibb</ENAMEX> is testing a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> to reverse sun
damage in skin. And, of course, who can miss the ads for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Propecia</ENAMEX>? All these
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs treat</ENAMEX> problems that most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> hadn't considered medical before.

            
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Insurers</ENAMEX> will try, as they must, to counter the tendency of quality-of-life
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> to redefine abnormality upward. But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">insurers</ENAMEX> are fighting an
irresistible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> play on the inevitable--some say genetic--human
desire for youth and immortality. As each new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> is released on a wave of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hype</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">insurers</ENAMEX> will fight the deluge, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> will clamor, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX>
will go along.

            
The transformation of normal to abnormal may
start with a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pill</ENAMEX>. But the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX>'s need for diagnosis is what drives the
process. Since the new quality-of-life <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> can have adverse health effects,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> need to come through <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX>. But we don't give out drugs
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">willy-nilly</ENAMEX>. We must provide a medical reason--a diagnosis. So we call
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">impotence</ENAMEX> "erectile dysfunction," baldness "hypotrichosis," and so on. The
rapid increase in attention-deficit disorder is a striking example of diagnosis
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">creep</ENAMEX>. The disorder hardly seemed to exist before the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stimulant Ritalin</ENAMEX> came
along. A core <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> do have a distinct attention abnormality, but
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ritalin</ENAMEX> worked so well--it can reduce distractibility even in perfectly normal
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>--that now almost any "difficult" <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> is considered for the diagnosis
and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX>. A <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX> study found that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">28 percent</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> diagnosed with the
disorder didn't actually meet the definition. Nevertheless, the percentage of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Ritalin</ENAMEX> has doubled since then.

            By
giving a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s condition a medical name, we turn it into a medical
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">abnormality</ENAMEX>. That creates a presumption that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">insurers</ENAMEX> must pay. It also creates
a presumption that it will be treated. If I write a new diagnosis in a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s chart, I have to indicate what I plan to do about it. It'd be
malpractice not to. More than that, once a condition is established as a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">diagnosis</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">society</ENAMEX> practically treats it as a crime not to do something about
it.

            This raises an ironic prospect. Quality-of-life drugs offer
not just the pleasing possibility that you can do something about
impotence, baldness, blackened toenails. They create a culture in which you
must fight against these conditions--even if it means risking serious
side effects (the anti-fungal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> for nails can damage the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Propecia</ENAMEX>'s
anti-testosterone action can decrease libido). By their sheer effectiveness,
the quality-of-life drugs narrow the range of what society accepts as normal.
In doing so, they may ultimately reduce the quality of life for the many of us
who are less than perfectly endowed.
