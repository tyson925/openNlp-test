            It isn't quite as much fun
as it used to be now that tobacco <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lobbyists</ENAMEX> are admitting that nicotine is
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">addictive</ENAMEX> and smoking is harmful. But the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">flacks</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Beverage</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institute</ENAMEX> are doing their best to take up the slack. They're fighting to stop
federal legislation that would crack down harder on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who drive after
drinking. The measure--backed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mothers Against Drunk Driving</ENAMEX> and up for a
vote as an amendment to the highway bill <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next month</TIMEX>--would make all states
change their definition of who is drunk from a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> with a minimum
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">blood-alcohol</ENAMEX> level of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.10</NUMEX> to someone with a level of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.08 percent</NUMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABI</ENAMEX>'s
case against the proposal is surprisingly persuasive. Well, almost.

            
Currently, everywhere in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> it is illegal to drive with a
blood-alcohol concentration of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.10 percent</NUMEX> or higher. But with alcohol-related
crashes claiming <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 17,000</NUMEX> lives a year--accounting for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">41 percent</NUMEX> of all
traffic fatalities--<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> have dropped that level to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.08 percent</NUMEX>. Now,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Lautenberg</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">N.J.</ENAMEX>, is leading a push to make the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.08</NUMEX> level a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">national</ENAMEX> standard.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABI</ENAMEX> says the whole effort is nuts. A trade association
for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> that serve <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX>, it offers <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> arguments. First, its
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lobbyists</ENAMEX> say, hardly any drinking at all can put you over the limit. As ABI
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">spokesman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Doyle</ENAMEX> says, "All it takes for a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">120-pound</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> glasses
of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> at a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX>, and she's going to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">jail</ENAMEX> ... just the same as if she
downed a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gin</ENAMEX>." The lower standard will capture perfectly responsible
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">social</ENAMEX> drinkers and dramatically increase the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drivers</ENAMEX> who would be
subject to arrest. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, they say it's the roaring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drunks</ENAMEX> who are out there
killing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. "Suppose we had <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> dying at <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">110 miles an hour</NUMEX>," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Doyle</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">observes</ENAMEX>, "and I said let's lower the speed limit to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45</NUMEX>. Wouldn't somebody say
that's ludicrous<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">?</ENAMEX>"

            The argument is not
unreasonable. When I'm on duty in the emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>, I see all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> of
serious car crashes that come through. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">paramedics</ENAMEX> wheel them in and start
rattling off information while I check their breathing and injuries: "This is
an unidentified, white-male unrestrained <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">driver</ENAMEX> in a high-speed rollover,
unresponsive at the scene." You don't even have to wait for the results. You
know he's wasted on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> and possibly <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>, too. I've never seen a positive
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> level less than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 0.20 percent</NUMEX> in these cases. It seems like
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drivers</ENAMEX> in crashes are either completely blotto or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stone</ENAMEX>-cold sober.

            The
damnedest thing is, after we save them, they hardly ever get arrested for
driving while intoxicated. An injured drunken <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">driver</ENAMEX> is far less likely to be
charged than an uninjured one. Studies show that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 percent to 80 percent</NUMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">drunken</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drivers</ENAMEX> escape prosecution. There are many reasons. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Police</ENAMEX> have to put
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">driver</ENAMEX>'s safety <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> and ship them off to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>; following after the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">driver</ENAMEX> is a major hassle, and things happen so fast, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> sometimes don't
even realize <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> is involved. But we know.

            
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> suggest my experience is a bit one-sided, however. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">About 60 percent</NUMEX> of
alcohol-related fatal crashes do involve <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drivers</ENAMEX> with an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> level of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.15</NUMEX>
percent or higher. But <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7 percent</NUMEX> involve <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drivers</ENAMEX> with a level of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.08 percent</NUMEX>
or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.09 percent</NUMEX>--killing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an estimated 1,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> per year.

            The ABI
claims that there's no evidence that a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.08</NUMEX> level is any more dangerous than a
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.02</NUMEX> level. However, a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX> study in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal of Studies on Alcohol</ENAMEX>
from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Insurance Institute for Highway Safety</ENAMEX> showed otherwise. It found that
the risk of a single-<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicle</ENAMEX> crash for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">driver</ENAMEX> with a blood-alcohol level of
<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.05 percent</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.09 percent</NUMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> times that of someone at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.02 percent</NUMEX> to
<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.04 percent</NUMEX>. Higher is certainly worse. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Drivers</ENAMEX> with a level of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.10 percent</NUMEX>
to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.14 percent</NUMEX> are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48</NUMEX> times more likely to crash, and those at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.15 percent</NUMEX> or
more are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">385</NUMEX> times more likely to crash. But getting behind the wheel with a
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.08</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> level is risky--more risky than any other known factor, including
young age and driving at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>.

            Nonetheless, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABI</ENAMEX>'s specter of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> ending up in jail for
driving after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as little as two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drinks</ENAMEX> is giving some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">policy-makers</ENAMEX> pause. But
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABI</ENAMEX> is using loaded dice to play on our ignorance of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> levels. By
choosing a skinnier than average <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> and defining each "drink" as <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6 ounces</NUMEX> of
high-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol wine</ENAMEX>, they make it sound easy to hit <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.08</NUMEX>. But <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of these
"drinks" are equal to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about half</NUMEX> a bottle of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX>.

            How many
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drinks</ENAMEX> does it really take for your blood to reach <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.08 percent</NUMEX> alcohol? To
make it simple, let's talk in terms of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">12-ounce</NUMEX> cans of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Budweiser</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 5</NUMEX>
percent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX>). It would take <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.5</NUMEX> cans in an hour on an empty stomach to put
the average <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">137-pound</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> over that limit, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.5</NUMEX> cans for a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">170-pound</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>. Or
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about a six</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pack</ENAMEX> in the course of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an evening</TIMEX>. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Estimate</ENAMEX> your own capacity by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clicking</ENAMEX> here.) These are
peak levels. After you stop drinking, your alcohol level drops <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 0.02</NUMEX>
percent <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an hour</TIMEX>. Also, keep in mind, light beer has <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 percent</NUMEX> less alcohol
than regular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beer</ENAMEX>. Wine has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">anywhere from two to four</NUMEX> times as much <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX>,
but <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6 ounces</NUMEX> of a typical table <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> would be about the same as a can of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bud</ENAMEX>. A
single martini would have about twice as much <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> as that.

            
It's silly that this is all such a guessing
game. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australia</ENAMEX>, breathalyzer machines for checking your
own alcohol level apparently are ubiquitous at bars and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stadiums</ENAMEX>. Still, most
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> know by now that after a few <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beers</ENAMEX> at dinner, they've had too much to
get up and drive. A <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.08</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> limit is not going to catch as many people
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">unawares</ENAMEX> as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABI</ENAMEX> claims. And drinking even less than what it takes to put
you over the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.08</NUMEX> standard is still not entirely safe.

            Is lowering the legal
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> level worth it? The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lobbyists</ENAMEX> are right that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drivers</ENAMEX> with a
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.08</NUMEX>-percent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> level are not the core of the drunken-driving problem. If
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> get even a large fraction of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">drunken</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drivers</ENAMEX> off the road, at most they
might save <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a few hundred</NUMEX> lives. This is a drop in the bucket. Prosecuting the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">drunken</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drivers</ENAMEX> who turn up in emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> or offering breathalyzer checks
in bars and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stadiums</ENAMEX> would probably save many more.

            Yet there is no good reason
not to go with the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.08</NUMEX> standard. I am not one of those public-health <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">types</ENAMEX> who
thinks every hazard should be eliminated. I was glad to see highway speed
limits increased to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">65 miles per hour</NUMEX>, even knowing the greater dangers of
crashing. But the freedom to get behind the wheel after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> a bottle of wine
at dinner or <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an evening</TIMEX> downing a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pack</ENAMEX>--or whatever it takes to get your
blood level to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.08 percent</NUMEX> alcohol--has little value. It is not worth an
elevenfold risk of crashing. And it's certainly not worth <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of
lives.
