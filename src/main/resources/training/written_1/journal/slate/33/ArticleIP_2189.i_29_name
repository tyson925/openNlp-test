and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ye Shall</ENAMEX> Find
            

            Starting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</TIMEX>, you can
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">search Slate</ENAMEX>, including "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Compost</ENAMEX>" (our archive), for specific words or phrases. Use
this feature to find articles by a particular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> or a reference to a
particular subject. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate Search</ENAMEX> is located on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Compost</ENAMEX> page, but search
results will include current articles (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">within a day</TIMEX> of their posting) as well
as older ones. (If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate Search</ENAMEX> isn't available when you go to check, it will
be shortly.) The rules are pretty simple:

            A search for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bill</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gates</ENAMEX> (or <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Bill</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gates</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gates</ENAMEX> ) will find articles
containing both the word bill 
               and the word
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gates</ENAMEX> .

            A search for "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gates"</ENAMEX> (in quotes) will find articles containing the exact phrase bill
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gates</ENAMEX> .

            The search is not
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">case-sensitive</ENAMEX> (i.e., capitalization doesn't matter).

            A few more
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">pointers:</ENAMEX>

            It is possible to search for
words other than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Gates</ENAMEX> , but that is not recommended, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate</ENAMEX>
cannot be held responsible for the result.

            A search for "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gates"</ENAMEX> will find only favorable references. To find unfavorable references,
search somewhere else.

            
               You Can
Make the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX>
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> make <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> justified
complaints about our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> ranking of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>'s largest contributors to charity.
Indeed, we make these complaints ourselves. First, the list is not a very
accurate measure of sacrifice for good causes, since it doesn't factor in a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>'s wealth or income. In fact, few if any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> have had
to suffer any diminution of their lifestyle as a consequence of having given
away money. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate 60</ENAMEX> list does not attempt to weigh the merits of
different <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">charities</ENAMEX>. Much of the money given away by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate 60</ENAMEX> goes to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">finance</ENAMEX> new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> at already wealthy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">universities</ENAMEX>.

            We think these defects aren't
fatal. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate 60</ENAMEX> list still serves to encourage and acknowledge
extraordinary generosity by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who, after all, don't have to give
the money away, however painless that might be. And ranking by size of gift
provides a useful objective measure. But we'd also like to acknowledge
extraordinary generosity by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> for whom it hurts, and to encourage more
imaginative giving.

            Therefore (at the suggestion
of occasional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">contributor</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atlantic Monthly</ENAMEX> national
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">correspondent</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nicholas Lemann</ENAMEX>), we invite nominations for a <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Supplemental 60</ENAMEX>
(better name forthcoming, let's hope). E-mail your suggestions to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jodie T. Allen</ENAMEX>, at letters@slate.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">com</ENAMEX>. She says she'll be looking for
contributions that

            are innovative--or at least
interesting--though not wacky; and/or
            

            wouldn't normally result in
either the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">donor</ENAMEX>'s name being inscribed in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">granite</ENAMEX> or his or her being honored
at a glitzy dinner or other ceremony; and/or
            

            represent a significant
sacrifice or effort by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">donor</ENAMEX>; and (no or)
            

            are likely to result in some
tangible good--recognizing that everyone won't agree with our (or the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">donor</ENAMEX>'s)
definition thereof.

            The first challenge to
potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nominees</ENAMEX>, obviously, is to parse the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boolean</ENAMEX> logic of these
standards. (Would that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate</ENAMEX>'s new search engine were so sophisticated.) But
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Jodie</NUMEX> points to the story <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</TIMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> who
pledged--anonymously--<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2,000</NUMEX> to each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Grand Forks</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">N.D.</ENAMEX>, that was
victimized by the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Red River</ENAMEX> flood as an example of what we're looking for. This
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">woman</ENAMEX>'s generosity could cost <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">her $10 million</NUMEX>. And it may not even be tax
deductible.
