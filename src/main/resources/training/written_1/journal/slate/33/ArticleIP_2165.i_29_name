            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SLATE</ENAMEX> will not publish
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next week</TIMEX>. In the great tradition of political and cultural journalism, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> will spend <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the week</TIMEX> lying on the beach, perhaps reading the odd scrap
of old-fashioned print-on-paper, and resting up for the election campaign and
other ordeals ahead. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SLATE</ENAMEX> is proud to be launching this hoary custom of summer
editorial sloth into cyberspace. However, our computers will be on the job.
(They neglected to ask for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the week</TIMEX> off in their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">union</ENAMEX> contract.) And they will
happily serve up the current issue, plus a complete inventory of past articles
and features (in "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Compost</ENAMEX>") while we're gone. New <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">material</ENAMEX> will be posted
beginning <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">noon PDT</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Aug. 12</TIMEX>, with a complete new issue by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Aug.</TIMEX>
16.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SLATE</ENAMEX>'s been online for
over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a month</TIMEX> now, and in general, we're pleased with the reaction. Claims about
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readership</ENAMEX> tend to be even more dubious in the online world than they are in
the world of traditional paper <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazines</ENAMEX>. Counting Internet <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> is an
inexact science, lending itself to exaggeration. But here's our count, as
honest as we can make it. Excluding our launch <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week</TIMEX>, when the numbers were much
higher, we've been serving up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 100,000</NUMEX> pages <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a day</TIMEX>. That would be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> a day, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">70,000</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a week</TIMEX>, reading an average of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> pages each online.
(Of course, it could also be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> a day looking at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> page each and
turning away in disgust, or it could be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> of my aunts, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">uncles</ENAMEX>, and cousins
busily inflating the numbers by clicking up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,000</NUMEX> pages <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a day</TIMEX>.)

            These
figures don't include <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who are printing out SLATE directly from the cover
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">page</ENAMEX> (or getting it by e-mail). From anecdotal evidence, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SLATE</ENAMEX>'s special
print-out edition seems to be a popular option, but we have no numbers on it.
Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> tell me they're downloading the print-out file and reading it on
screen but offline. We never even thought of that. (Soon, though, we'll be
offering an offline reading edition that retains some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Web</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interactivity</ENAMEX> and graphics that aren't in the print-out file.) We've recently
reformatted the print-out edition to make it more attractive and reduce the
number of pages (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">just 27</NUMEX> for the whole <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Aug. 1</TIMEX>, issue). We've also
added an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adobe Acrobat</ENAMEX> version, along with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft Word</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>. Try it out,
if you haven't already.

            Another surprise: <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX> is the most popular day for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reading SLATE</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Readership</ENAMEX> declines through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the week</TIMEX> and is lowest on the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">weekends</ENAMEX>. We have designed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> to be most current and timely
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX>--when we update "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Week/The Spin</ENAMEX>," for example--with the thought that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> would like to read it over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the weekend</TIMEX>. But maybe that's wrong. In any
event, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX> is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> we update the "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Horse Race</ENAMEX>" campaign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pundits</ENAMEX>' analysis,
and give you instant reviews of the "Other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Magazines</ENAMEX>" that come out Monday
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek</ENAMEX> , The 
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Yorker</ENAMEX> , etc.) So
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX>'s not <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a bad day</TIMEX> either. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> we hear from actually do seem to
enjoy popping in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every couple of days</TIMEX> to see what's new, which is a more
gratifying surprise.

            Another measure of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">readership</ENAMEX> (though not necessarily of satisfied <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readership</ENAMEX>) is response. We've
been getting <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between 700 and 800</NUMEX> e-mail comments from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every week</TIMEX>. Our
"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Everyday Economics</ENAMEX>" <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">columnist</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven Landsburg</ENAMEX>, tells us he got <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> personal
e-mail messages about his <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> column. When I called our "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Varnish Remover</ENAMEX>"
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">columnist</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Shrum</ENAMEX>, to tell him that some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> were complaining about
having a self-described <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrat</ENAMEX> analyzing both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX>' political commercials
(though I think he's doing a fine, neutral job), he said the only complaint
he's gotten himself was from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of weeks</TIMEX>, we'll be
launching our bulletin board, "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Fray</ENAMEX>," where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> or
any other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX> can bitch and moan to their hearts' content (though a kind word
or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> would also be appreciated). But it's already clear that we have just the
kind of active, engaged <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readership</ENAMEX> we were hoping for.

            We'll
know more about who our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> are when free registration begins in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> or
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three weeks</TIMEX>. We're planning to tell <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">advertisers</ENAMEX> that you're all highly
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">educated</ENAMEX>, high-income, politically engaged, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">purchasers</ENAMEX> of vast quantities
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">automobiles</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designer</ENAMEX> clothing, books, records, military <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>, and
alcoholic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beverages</ENAMEX>. Please don't let us down.

            
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">This first month</TIMEX> has been a learning process.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Warren Buffett</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>-richest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> (after somebody whose name I've
forgotten), has written that he's suspicious of anyone who talks of learning
from his own mistakes. The trick, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buffett</ENAMEX> says, is to learn from other
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>'s mistakes. Still, if you're going to make mistakes, you might as
well learn from them. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SLATE</ENAMEX>'s made a few. Initially we were incompatible with
too many browsers--including early versions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Netscape</ENAMEX>. We think we've solved
that. (And if we haven't, please let us know at slatetech@msn.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">com</ENAMEX>.) We're still a bit slow to download
compared with some other sites--<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 20 percent</NUMEX>, according to our resident
tech <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gurus</ENAMEX>--but we're working on that, too. Our original idea of a separate
cover and contents page, united by theme music, has not, in our view, been a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">success</ENAMEX>, and we'll be reworking that in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the weeks ahead</TIMEX>. (Meanwhile, many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX>
seem to be missing the contents page completely, thus missing many articles and
features. You can skip the cover and go directly to the contents page, if you
want, at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">slate</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">com/TOC/Current/Contents.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">asp</ENAMEX>--or, of course, you can
spare yourself the gibberish and bookmark it.)

            Amajor screw-up, to be honest, has been our e-mail delivery.
In theory, it should be great: a file, delivered straight to your computer,
that you can print out (or read on screen) as the latest SLATE. At last count,
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 16,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> had signed up. We knew there'd be some problems with
many e-mail systems in receiving this rather large file. What we weren't
prepared for was problems in sending it. We apologize, and hope that's starting
to work right for you. (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last Friday</TIMEX>'s delivery went pretty well.)
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SLATE</ENAMEX> 
               on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paper</ENAMEX> , our <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</TIMEX> printed edition, to be available by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Mail</ENAMEX> and at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Starbucks</ENAMEX>, also has been pushed back a month. But the first
issue will be out by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of August</TIMEX>. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Call</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">800-555-4995</ENAMEX> to subscribe.)

            Our cover feature a couple
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks ago</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">"Electric Chairs"</ENAMEX>), about designing a chair for reading an online
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">magazine</ENAMEX>, was one I was uncertain about. It surprised me pleasantly by
generating a large and entertaining response. (See a sample in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX>'s "E-Mail to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Editors</ENAMEX>.") For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next week</TIMEX>, though, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SLATE</ENAMEX> will be
emphasizing comfort above all in our choices of where to sit. And should these
be places from where we can't read a computer screen, that's OK too.

            See you <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Aug. 12</TIMEX>, or soon
thereafter, we hope.
