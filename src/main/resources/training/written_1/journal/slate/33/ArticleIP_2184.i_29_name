"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Sleep With Your Daughter" Issue</ENAMEX>
            

            By what we beg you to
believe is a bizarre coincidence, this issue of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate</ENAMEX> contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> articles
that take a benign view of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fathers</ENAMEX> sleeping with their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughters</ENAMEX>. (Depending on
when you visit the site, one of these may already be in "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Compost</ENAMEX>." But it will
still be available there.) To publish one article on this tawdry subject may be
regarded as a slip-up; to publish <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> looks like an obsession. But sex between
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fathers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughters</ENAMEX> is an unavoidable subject at the moment, because of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kathryn Harrison</ENAMEX>'s memoir, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Kiss</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Random House</ENAMEX>). Our senior
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">contributor Ann Hulbert</ENAMEX> reviewed it <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX>, somewhat skeptically. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">This week</TIMEX>,
another regular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">contributor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Luc Sante</ENAMEX>, comes to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harrison</ENAMEX>'s
defense against vitriolic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reviewers</ENAMEX> (among whom he does not include
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hulbert</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sante</ENAMEX> doesn't necessarily endorse <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> liaisons, of
course, but he does endorse writing about them. (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Next month</TIMEX> we will publish a
"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dialogue</ENAMEX>" between <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harrison</ENAMEX> and one of her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX>.)

            Our "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Earthling</ENAMEX>"
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">columnist</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Wright</ENAMEX>, by contrast, does indeed endorse sleeping with your
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX>. In fact, he says he's shared a bed with both his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughters</ENAMEX>--and his
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughters</ENAMEX>, we hasten to add, were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> at the time, and his
column is an argument against "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Ferberizing</ENAMEX>"--the near-universal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
practice of training <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">babies</ENAMEX> to sleep alone by ignoring their tears of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">loneliness</ENAMEX> and terror. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferber</ENAMEX> says it's good for them. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wright</ENAMEX>
disagrees. We'll see how his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughters</ENAMEX> turn out, and let you know in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 30</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>.

            Then there's our "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Good</ENAMEX>
Sport" <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">contributor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joel Achenbach</ENAMEX>, whose article on the
thoroughbred-racing-stud system, "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Emission</ENAMEX>
Accomplished," is mostly a highly educational description of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> horses
mating. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Birds</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX> are not in the same league. As <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Achenbach</ENAMEX> is not vulgar
enough to point out (but we are), his piece puts all those stories about
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Catherine the Great</ENAMEX> in a vivid new perspective.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate</ENAMEX>,
let us be clear, is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> about politics, policy, and culture--not about
sleeping arrangements, whether among family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, or both or
neither. Who knows what mysterious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> led us down this garden <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">path</ENAMEX>? As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noel</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Coward</ENAMEX> once sang, "That cow's expression is quite obscene/It must have
something to do with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spring</ENAMEX>." <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Next week</TIMEX>, though, it's back to the Future of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX>. Or perhaps a Survey of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canadian Fiction</ENAMEX>. We promise.

Lurking
            

            "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Fray</ENAMEX>," our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX>-discussion
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">forum</ENAMEX>, has always required <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> registration. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> make us do this
because <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> are publishing messages to the world and must take some
responsibility for what they say. But it recently occurred to us--we're a
little slow--that this logic applies only to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who want to write in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fray</ENAMEX>, not to those who just want to read it. So <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">from now</TIMEX> on, you can enter the
Fray--from the bottom of every article in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate</ENAMEX> or from the contents
page--without registering or signing in. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Registration/Sign</ENAMEX>-In page pops up
only if you want to put in your own <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2 cents</NUMEX>' worth. We strongly encourage you
to do so. It's fun. It's free. And, in case you weren't aware of it, in the Web
culture <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who enter bulletin boards and chat <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> but don't join in the
conversation are known as "lurkers." It's not considered sportsmanlike. At
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate</ENAMEX>, though, we don't mind. Lurk away. It's easier than ever.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boy Makes Good</ENAMEX>
            

            It's
being announced <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> this appears on the Web, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 28</TIMEX>, that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate</ENAMEX>'s
poetry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Pinsky</ENAMEX>, has been selected as the next <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poet laureate</ENAMEX> of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert</ENAMEX>, who selects our <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">poem</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every week</TIMEX>, is much too
modest to have chosen <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of his own. But you can sample his prose style in two
"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Diary</ENAMEX>" columns he has written for us, one in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August</TIMEX> and one in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December</TIMEX> (both available in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Compost</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poet laureate</ENAMEX> is an
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Library</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>. His or her duties include converting all
public remarks by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> into iambic pentameter (rhyming
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">optional</ENAMEX>); composing ribald limericks about any lawsuits filed against the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> for sexual harassment; and debating the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Foreign Relations Committee</ENAMEX> about whether a poem is lovely as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>. Actually,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poet laureate</ENAMEX>'s duties are a bit vague. But we hope to persuade <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pinsky</ENAMEX> to
keep another diary for us after his enthronement so that we can learn what it's
all about. Meanwhile, his epic poem about <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fathers</ENAMEX> sleeping with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughters</ENAMEX> will
be appearing on this site shortly.
