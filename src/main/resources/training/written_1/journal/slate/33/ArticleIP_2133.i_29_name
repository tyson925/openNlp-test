            <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">New Yorkers</ENAMEX> have bagels, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San</ENAMEX>
Franciscans the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Golden Gate</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Seattle</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">natives</ENAMEX> reserve their civic pride
for hating <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Californians</ENAMEX> and the predatory consumerism they stand for. There are
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rusting Volvos</ENAMEX> all over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Seattle</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University District</ENAMEX> with "Don't Californicate
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>" bumper stickers. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seattle Times</ENAMEX> recently ran a front-page
story about the increase of tailgating on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">freeways</ENAMEX>, a display of bad manners
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locals</ENAMEX> blame on the influx of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Californians</ENAMEX>.

            Rather
than criticize <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emigrants</ENAMEX> like myself, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locals</ENAMEX> should be kissing our
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tan</ENAMEX> lines. It is the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Californian</ENAMEX> mindset that is responsible for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Seattle</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miracle</ENAMEX>, whereby a sleepy backwater has been transformed into a dynamic
entrepreneurial hub and the most livable <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. When I
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> lived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Seattle</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-'70s</TIMEX>, it was a fussy little <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">hamlet</ENAMEX>, Mayberry
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NW</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Meat Is Murder</ENAMEX> food co-ops abounded and the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">40-hour</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">work week</TIMEX> was
considered indentured servitude. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> the unemployment rate is a percentage
point below the national average, and housing prices are soaring, driven by a
boom in software, biotechnology, and telecommunications <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX>. The pine-scented
air now hums with ambition and no one gets a day off.

            Just as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Seattle</ENAMEX>'s renaissance is fueled by an influx of
aggressive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">capitalists</ENAMEX>, its previous stagnation was caused by the sloth and
poor economic policies of its other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tenants</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indians</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Scandinavians</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hippies</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest Indians</ENAMEX> lived in a
land of vast abundance, the streams flush with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>, the forest thick with
game. Rather than invest their surplus in research and development or compete
to see who could build the biggest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest Indians</ENAMEX> instituted the
"potlatch," a tradition of achieving status by giving away one's wealth. No
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">investments</ENAMEX>. No competition. No ego. No progress.

            If <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Seattle</ENAMEX>
was initially held back by an indigenous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who didn't value individual
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">achievement</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rules of Acquisition</ENAMEX>, then the arrival of the Scandinavians
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1800s</TIMEX> only made things worse. In a previous "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Letter From</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>," a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NW</ENAMEX> chauvinist bragged that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vikings</ENAMEX> not only were the
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Europeans</ENAMEX> to visit the New World, but their <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">descendants</ENAMEX> shaped the
contemporary culture of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific Northwest</ENAMEX>, creating a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of tolerance and
egalitarian refinement. I beg to differ. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vikings</ENAMEX> may have made a
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">hit-and-run</ENAMEX> raid on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newfoundland</ENAMEX>, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Scandinavians</ENAMEX> who migrated to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pacific NW</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1800s</TIMEX> were not <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vikings</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Norse</ENAMEX> culture peaked <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1,500 years ago</TIMEX>
when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vikings</ENAMEX>-- Ã¼ber <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">capitalists</ENAMEX>--pillaged the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Isles</ENAMEX>. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seattle Scandinavians</ENAMEX> were ersatz <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norsemen</ENAMEX>, blond <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">socialists</ENAMEX> who thought the
basis of civilization was an upper tax rate of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90 percent</NUMEX>, dreary porno movies,
and their all-purpose greeting "uff <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">da</ENAMEX>," which, translated, means, "I've fallen
from grace and I can't get up." They created a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Seattle</ENAMEX> in which icy politeness
and neatly trimmed <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">grass</ENAMEX> were the ultimate virtues.

            
To make matters even worse, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the '70s</TIMEX> when
the hippies were driven out of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>, many of them migrated to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest</ENAMEX>, their <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">VW vans</ENAMEX> stuffed with copies of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lord of the Rings</ENAMEX> and
Small <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Is Beautiful</ENAMEX> . The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hippies</ENAMEX> believed that the only good capitalist
was someone selling loose <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">joints</ENAMEX> at the bus <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX>. In this spirit, a
moratorium on high-rise office <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> was passed by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Seattle</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> in the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early '80s</TIMEX>, in the hope that evil <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporations</ENAMEX> would be driven away. The region
slumbered, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> insulated in their down parkas and their "what's your
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">hurry?</ENAMEX>" smugness, until awakened by the hard-working <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Californians</ENAMEX> they complain
so much about.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Californians</ENAMEX> created the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Seattle</ENAMEX>, whose <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Twin Towers</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Starbucks</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Gates</ENAMEX>, though
a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Seattle</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">native</ENAMEX>, has the soul of a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Californian</ENAMEX>. He is smart and tough, a
take-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">no</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prisoners</ENAMEX> competitor. He is, of course, envied and distrusted by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">locals</ENAMEX>, who feel he should somehow "give more back to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX>." This is
code for "give us some of your money, we want to go skiing." If <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Gates</ENAMEX> is
the distant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> figure of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Seattle</ENAMEX>, fellow <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">billionaire</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allen</ENAMEX> is the beloved <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mom</ENAMEX>, representing the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Old Seattle</ENAMEX> virtues of fair play and
civic generosity.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Father</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill</ENAMEX> is lean and mean, evinces no interest in sports or popular culture, and
doesn't believe in giving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> an allowance. When he donates money, he endows a
chair at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Washington</ENAMEX> or a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stanford</ENAMEX> or computer
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sciences</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard</ENAMEX>--elitist actions that benefit the best and the brightest,
very <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Seattle</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moms Allen</ENAMEX>, by contrast, is round and fuzzy and a soft touch.
An egalitarian, he likes common-folk endeavors like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> sports and rock music.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allen</ENAMEX> bought the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portland Trailblazers</ENAMEX>, and plans to buy the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Seattle</ENAMEX> Seahawks
to prevent their departure for--you guessed it--<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allen</ENAMEX> is also
building a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> honoring <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Seattle</ENAMEX>'s favorite prodigal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX>, guitar god Jimi
Hendrix, and donated <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$25 million</NUMEX> to jump-start "The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commons</ENAMEX>," a plan to replace
<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">30 acres</NUMEX> of productive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX> with a huge <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> in the middle of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Seattle</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> turned down the project, realizing it would actually be
a vast open-air toilet for the homeless.

            Starbucks was a low-key <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">purveyor</ENAMEX> of fine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX> for years
until <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howard Schultz</ENAMEX>--a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">New Yorker</ENAMEX> who would be welcomed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>--took
over and turned it into a corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">behemoth</ENAMEX>, opening <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> across the world.
It's only a matter of time until <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Starbucks</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">premier</ENAMEX> caffeine-delivery
system on the planet. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> who bought stock in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Starbucks</ENAMEX> at the IPO can now
retire. So why isn't wealth-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">creator</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howard Schultz</ENAMEX> beloved by his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX>?
Simple: He acted like a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Californian</ENAMEX>.

            Ensconced in a large home
abutting a small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schultz</ENAMEX> enlarged his driveway and, with the definitive
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">grace</ENAMEX> of a successful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">CEO</ENAMEX>, erected a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Citizen Kane autograph</ENAMEX>-model gate. He also
encroached on a bit of park land in the process, just as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a thousand</NUMEX> other
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seattleites</ENAMEX> had. But it was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schultz</ENAMEX> who drew the outrage of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Old Seattle</ENAMEX>
types, who sued him. Now, after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> of litigation, a frustrated <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schultz</ENAMEX> plans
to put the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> on the market.

            Local boy
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gates</ENAMEX> wisely built his <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">45,000-square-foot</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> in suburban <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Seattle</ENAMEX>.
While the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">home</ENAMEX> still evinces mutterings of "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Xanadu</ENAMEX>" from the envious, it is
actually smaller than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aaron Spelling</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50,000-square-foot</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansion</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beverly</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hills</ENAMEX>, and no one in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> thinks it unseemly that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genius</ENAMEX> who brought
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">us Charlie</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Angels</ENAMEX> shouldn't reap the fruits of his labor. In
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> everyone thinks they might be the next <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to write the ultimate
sitcom and buy their own piece of paradise. They might, too.

            
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Californication</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Seattle</ENAMEX> continues. The
original <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seattleites</ENAMEX>--the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NW Indians</ENAMEX>--have become so <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Californian</ENAMEX> they're
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nevadans</ENAMEX>. Dissatisfied with the chump change earned by selling untaxed
cigarettes and fireworks, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indians</ENAMEX> have opened gambling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">casinos</ENAMEX> on
reservations all over the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. An initiative on the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November</TIMEX> ballot asks
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> to approve slot machines and video <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">poker</ENAMEX>, proceeds of which will be used
"to build esteem" among the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">native</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peoples</ENAMEX>. Just think, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of people
outside the mainstream with large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">explosives</ENAMEX>, cash, and slot
machines. ... If they were white, fundamentalist <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christians</ENAMEX> instead of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Native</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pantheists</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Janet Reno</ENAMEX> would send in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">tanks</ENAMEX>.

            Even <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moms Allen</ENAMEX> seems to be
turning <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Californian</ENAMEX>. He recently purchased <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">387 acres</NUMEX> on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Juan</ENAMEX>
Islands that is the site of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Camp Nor'Wester</ENAMEX>, a venerated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>'s summer
retreat. But instead of donating the island to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nature Conservancy, Allen</ENAMEX>
has evicted the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camp</ENAMEX> and plans to build something for himself.

            As for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Scandinavian</ENAMEX> old
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guard</ENAMEX> getting the message, well ... uff <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">da</ENAMEX> .
