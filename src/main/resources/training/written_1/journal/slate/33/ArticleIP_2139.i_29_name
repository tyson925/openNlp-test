            The <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Olympic Peninsula</ENAMEX> sits
perched on the northwest corner of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> like a small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, an expanse of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mountains</ENAMEX>, rivers, and coastlines wrapped by an arm of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific</ENAMEX> and
separated from the urban swath of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greater Seattle</ENAMEX> by the inland sea of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Puget</ENAMEX>
Sound. If peeled from a map, the peninsula would neatly cover my old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> state
of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Connecticut</ENAMEX> like a wet green stamp. But its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, strung along a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cluster</ENAMEX> of small coastal <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> reservations, would barely fill one
of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Connecticut</ENAMEX>'s midsize <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX>.

            When I
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> arrived here <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25 years ago</TIMEX>, a few pulp <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mills</ENAMEX>, logging, fishing, and
farming fleshed out the economy. The <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">million-acre</NUMEX> wilderness of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Olympic</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Park</ENAMEX> at the peninsula's heart caught my imagination, as did the
region's keen-edged <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhabitants</ENAMEX>. Seen in cross section--say, from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Port</ENAMEX>
Townsend, a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Victorian</ENAMEX> seaport of brick <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> and cupolas on the peninsula's
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">northeast</ENAMEX> shore, west to the "logging capital" of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Forks</ENAMEX>--the human landscape
has become incredibly diverse. But essential peninsula characteristics, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tics</ENAMEX> and quirks that make us who we are, have only deepened.

            
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Port Townsend</ENAMEX>'s transformation from fishing
port to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sausalito North</ENAMEX> was well underway when I arrived. Even then the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>'s
low rents and tolerance for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX>, live-aboard sailboat dreamers, and small
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">entrepreneurs</ENAMEX> held the seeds of its destruction. I place the blame for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s
wooden-boat festivals, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> arts programs, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">galleries</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cafes</ENAMEX> on
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19 th century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ethnologist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James G. Swan</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Collecting Northwest Coast</ENAMEX>
artifacts for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smithsonian</ENAMEX> and scribbling his wonderfully astute monographs
while his fellow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">townsmen</ENAMEX> were out stumping for commerce, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Swan</ENAMEX> introduced the
idea of the absorbed eccentric. It clung to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>'s mossy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">foundations</ENAMEX> like a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">limpet</ENAMEX>. But even <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Swan</ENAMEX> went to his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pauper</ENAMEX>'s grave still hoping for a rail
connection to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Seattle</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Seattle</ENAMEX> remains <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Port Townsend</ENAMEX>'s undesignated home
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">port</ENAMEX>.

            This, I
fear, has cast a permanent shadow over the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>'s cultural identity. When an
arts patron bequeathed a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">quarter-million dollars</NUMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> for a work of
public art in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the '80s</TIMEX>, the fledgling arts <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">commission</ENAMEX> invited big-city curators
to jury the competition. The result is a sterile concrete "tidal clock" that
collects whatever flotsam the tide brings in, and a wave-viewing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terrace</ENAMEX> more
suggestive of an industrial boat haul-out than a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pavilion</ENAMEX>. Meanwhile,
a proposal by local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sculptor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Jay</ENAMEX> that drew on the natural heritage of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">peninsula</ENAMEX> and its <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Native American</ENAMEX> roots became part of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">commission</ENAMEX> for the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Seattle</ENAMEX> suburb of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bellevue</ENAMEX>. At a party to send off the piece-- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salmon Woman</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Raven</ENAMEX> --a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> offered this toast: "No tears, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tim</ENAMEX>, we've still got the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ty-D-Bol</ENAMEX>."

            
Nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sequim</ENAMEX> brooks no such separation from
its past. Murals of farm <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> and country <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> decorate downtown
businesses even as the last <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dungeness Valley</ENAMEX> farmland is paved over with
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">blacktop</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the hottest retirement communities in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Puget Sound</ENAMEX>, Sequim
knows precisely where it wants to go and how many more new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">golf courses</ENAMEX> it will
take to get there.

            But even in this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,300</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">souls</ENAMEX> (and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> real-estate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>), the past has a way of rearing up
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unbidden</ENAMEX>. A recovering <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">herd</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roosevelt</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">elk</ENAMEX> has developed a taste for
expensive landscaping in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>'s recently developed highlands. The elk bed
down in hayfields alongside <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">U.S. 101</ENAMEX>, where traffic conditions have come to
resemble the "bear jams" of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yellowstone</ENAMEX>. Complaints were heavy until the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Department of Fish</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wildlife</ENAMEX> announced a hunting season on the
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all</NUMEX>-but-tame elk just beyond city limits. Elk <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lovers</ENAMEX> (and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sequim</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX>) expressed outrage; even some rose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gardeners</ENAMEX> voiced distress. But
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hunters</ENAMEX> from all over <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Puget Sound</ENAMEX> rushed to apply for permits. Life where wild
and tame collide will get even more interesting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this fall</TIMEX>.

            
Meanwhile, a wave of roses and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">golf carts</ENAMEX> pushes slowly west from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sequim</ENAMEX>, like
a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> settling of the peninsula. The frontier (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">retirees</ENAMEX> riding lawnmowers on
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> side, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">loggers</ENAMEX> wielding chainsaws on the other) is continually in flux.
Right now I place it <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">six miles</NUMEX> east of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Port Angeles</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Port Angeles</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Speedway</ENAMEX>. Not long ago, some newly arrived speedway <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> petitioned
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Clallam County</ENAMEX> for an ordinance regulating the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">track</ENAMEX>'s excessive noise. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">commissioners</ENAMEX> (frontiersmen, all) were unmoved. "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Speedway</ENAMEX> was here <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>," they
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">decreed</ENAMEX>, and dismissed the proposal.

            
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> peninsula <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX> hasn't changed much in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past 25 years</TIMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Port Angeles</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">County</ENAMEX> seat, business <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>, pulp
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">manufacturer</ENAMEX>, log-shipping <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">port</ENAMEX>, it remains stolidly practical, working <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX>,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democratic</ENAMEX>, and the recent closure of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> large pulp <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mills</ENAMEX> has
precipitated an identity crisis. Those clinging to the old economic order want
nothing more than another large <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mill</ENAMEX>. Others envision a conference <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>, an
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">aquarium</ENAMEX>, and a performing-arts <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> (to complement the already existing
fine-arts <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>). Meanwhile, money to retrain <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> flows into the community
from the state and federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX>, feeding a cottage industry that may
prove one of the peninsula's most enduring economies.

            Nowhere
on the peninsula is federal largess more central to the economy than in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Forks</ENAMEX>,
and nowhere is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populace</ENAMEX> more critical of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>. From the free land
doled out to the original <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">settlers</ENAMEX> through various subsidies like bounties and
timber giveaways to the big bucks of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Forest Service</ENAMEX> deficit-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">timber</ENAMEX> sales, Forks
has supped mightily at the public trough.

            
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last week</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Forks</ENAMEX> city <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clerk</ENAMEX> determined the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">town</ENAMEX> was getting "stiffed" out of its share of federal aid for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> hurt
by cutbacks in federal timber sales. So the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> pulled out of the program.
Period. Federal grant applications for improving the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>'s industrial park
(itself a federally subsidized project), upgrading its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sewer system</ENAMEX>,
rehabilitating a government <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX>, building a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">golf course</ENAMEX> ... were
abandoned.

            "It
makes a statement," the city <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clerk</ENAMEX> said. A meeting with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">district</ENAMEX>'s member
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> has been scheduled, but I have no doubt how this will end. Forks
will receive funding for its entire wish list, probably with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Port Angeles</ENAMEX>'
conference <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> thrown in for good measure.

            
The peninsula may be on the take, but it still
believes in hard work. During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the '70s and '80s</TIMEX> I packed up <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each February</TIMEX> and
headed west to work replanting clearcuts and thinning young <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> in the rainy
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">woods</ENAMEX> around <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Forks</ENAMEX>. Most any personal frailty--be it a penchant for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Celtic</ENAMEX> harp
music, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Oriental</ENAMEX> poetry, even moderate environmental sentiments--could be
overlooked if a body isn't afraid of work. It is the common <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glue</ENAMEX> that binds
us.

            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A few years ago</TIMEX> I was
helping a neighbor thread tracks back onto his bulldozer. He had disassembled
the steel pads, welded new cleats on each <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>, and strung them back together.
He was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">65</NUMEX> at the time. We were on our backs in gravel under the machine, when
he mentioned offhandedly, "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jakeman</ENAMEX> has a set of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tracks</ENAMEX> he'd given me for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>
bucks." <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dumbfounded</ENAMEX>, I asked why he hadn't taken them. He lowered the greasy
wrench from his hand, looked at me, and confessed, "I couldn't bear the thought
of somebody else getting to work on these." Somehow, he knew I'd
understand.
