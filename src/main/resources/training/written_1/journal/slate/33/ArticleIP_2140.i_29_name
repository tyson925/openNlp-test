            Why hasn't the
steel-bending, number-crunching competence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nerds</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>
rubbed off on those who build this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridges</ENAMEX>, ferries, and nuclear
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">reactors</ENAMEX>? Why is this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whiz kid</ENAMEX>'s paradise also the world capital of
boondoggles, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">heartland</ENAMEX> of the misconceived, misdesigned, and misbuilt?

            A
tradition was born on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Nov. 7, 1940</TIMEX>, when "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Galloping Gertie</ENAMEX>," the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4-month-old</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Tacoma Narrows Bridge</ENAMEX>, writhed, snapped, and collapsed. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gertie</ENAMEX> would be hanging
still, a marvel of suspension design, but for one rather obvious fault<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">: Her</ENAMEX>
stiffening girders--solid plates rather than the usual open trusses--caught the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">full</TIMEX> blast in a high-wind corridor. Caught on film, the catastrophe has
delighted generations of science <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> as a demonstration of oscillating
wave motion.

            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">The day</TIMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gertie</ENAMEX> opened, so did the world's longest
floating <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX>, which connected <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Seattle</ENAMEX> to its Eastside suburbs across <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lake</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>. It took <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50 years</TIMEX>, but we finally sank this sturdy floater. During a
summer spruce-up, its pontoon hatches were opened to catch the dirty runoff
from hydraulic hoses that were being used to clean it. The hatches were
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inadvertently</ENAMEX> left open till <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November</TIMEX>, when rainwater topped the pontoons and
scuttled the whole show. These weren't the only <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridges</ENAMEX> to which
disaster paid a visit. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1979</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hood Canal Bridge</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Olympic Peninsula</ENAMEX>,
which had supplanted the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lake Washington</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">span</ENAMEX> as the longest floater, sank in
high seas. (At least its pontoons were sealed.) <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">The year before</TIMEX>, the freighter
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SS Chavez</ENAMEX> wrecked the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Seattle</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">drawbridge</ENAMEX>, forcing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> to build the
new high <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Seattleites</ENAMEX> had long sought. It was whispered that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">locals</ENAMEX> had arranged for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chavez</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">80-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilot</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rolf Neslund</ENAMEX>, to ram
the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Neslund</ENAMEX> took whatever secrets he had to the burn barrel <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</TIMEX>
later, when his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> shot him and torched his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">remains</ENAMEX>.

            
When <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridges</ENAMEX> fall, ferries still float. And if
any <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> ought to know how to build them, it's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>, which operates the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>'s largest ferry system. Even so, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early '80s</TIMEX> it built <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>
god-awful "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">super-ferries</ENAMEX>" that required <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $5 million</NUMEX> in corrective
repairs. Their electronic propulsion systems tended to conk out, especially
when braking, causing them to smash <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dock</ENAMEX> after another. On dry land,
government projects haven't fared much better. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> added a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100-foot-tall</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">deck</ENAMEX> to the north side of its football
stadium. It was designed by the acclaimed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineers</ENAMEX> behind many of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Seattle</ENAMEX>'s
commercial skyscrapers, all of which remain standing, thank you. But this was a
state <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">project</ENAMEX>: When a roof support buckled, the whole frame tumbled to the
<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50-yard</NUMEX> line. Afterward, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">recriminations</ENAMEX> flew: Was a bad weld to blame, or
defective steel from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Korea</ENAMEX>?

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years later</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Hammering Man</ENAMEX> , the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">48-foot, 13-ton</NUMEX> sculpture that today
stands outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seattle Art Museum</ENAMEX>, slipped its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">installation</ENAMEX> and
hit the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pavement</ENAMEX>. Could have happened anywhere? <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">At least 20</NUMEX> other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hammering Men</ENAMEX>
have been raised around the world, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> taller than <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Seattle</ENAMEX>'s. None has
tumbled.

            While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">programmers</ENAMEX> made the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> billions,
state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> wasted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> on a failed computerization scheme. While local
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">boy Craig McCaw</ENAMEX> built his cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Seattle</ENAMEX>'s transit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> procured a
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$5 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bus</ENAMEX>-radio system that never worked. Inspired as these follies are,
they pale before the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>'s most expensive boondoggle (and history's biggest
bond default): the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$26 billion</NUMEX> WPPSS (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Public Power Supply System</ENAMEX>)
cash-toss. Consider: <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> has built <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> cookie-cutter nuclear-power <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>
that work. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">WPPSS</ENAMEX> used <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> different designs to build <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>, one of
which worked.

            Why does this high-tech haven
produce such jumbo <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">turkeys</ENAMEX>? My guess is that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> is the mirror image of
the old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Soviet Union</ENAMEX>, where only the military and space industries functioned.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russians</ENAMEX> built the sturdy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sputnik, MiGs</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AK-47s</ENAMEX>, but they couldn't make
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bras</ENAMEX> or toasters. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>, the private sector makes fine stuff and the
public sector sinks <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridges</ENAMEX>. Perhaps competence is a finite quantity,
apportioned between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sectors</ENAMEX>. When one gets too much, watch out for the
other. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WPPSS</ENAMEX> is the price we pay for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Silicon Forest</ENAMEX>.

            Not that
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> can't build anything right out here. Amid political and legal
turmoil, it raised the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kingdome</ENAMEX>--<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Seattle</ENAMEX>'s biggest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> and the world's
widest concrete roofspan--for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a third</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> the cost of other <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1970s</ENAMEX> sports
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">domes</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $160 million</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s money). Granted, this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">home</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mariners</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">baseball</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seahawks</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">football</ENAMEX>, and everybody's favorite <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">tractor-</ENAMEX>pulls is
plug-ugly inside and out. But its hyperbolic-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">paraboloid</NUMEX> roof system is a
renowned engineering triumph. It has weathered moderate earthquakes with nary a
crack or untoward ripple, and looks as fit for the eventual big one as it did
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20 years ago</TIMEX>.

            
So how has the county <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> that owns the
Kingdome dealt with this unseemly achievement? By trying its best to undo it.
First it cheaped out on maintenance, letting birds peck away the roof's foam
covering. Then it accepted an implausibly low bid to re-cover that roof, from
an inexperienced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contractor</ENAMEX> who blasted the old <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foam</ENAMEX> off with water <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">jets</ENAMEX>. The
resulting leaks dislodged four ceiling tiles, which in turn prompted a
pull-out-the-stops rush to scour and re-cover the roof and ceiling before
<ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">football</ENAMEX> season. A <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$5 million</NUMEX> job grew to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$67 million</NUMEX>.

            After readying the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dome</ENAMEX>'s
roof for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the ages</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">county</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> decided to raze it and replace it with
a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$327 million</NUMEX> roofless football <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stadium</ENAMEX> and a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$414 million</NUMEX> baseball
stadium with a retractable roof. (I'm sure both projects will come in on
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">budget</ENAMEX>, and that the retractable roof will work flawlessly.) Among the
arguments advanced in support of knocking down the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kingdome</ENAMEX> was one that
especially resonated with any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boondogglia</ENAMEX>: It had to be replaced
because its roof was "falling down." Ah, the things we'll do to snatch disaster
from the jaws of competence. Now can we get some of that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Korean</ENAMEX> steel for the
new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stadiums</ENAMEX>?
