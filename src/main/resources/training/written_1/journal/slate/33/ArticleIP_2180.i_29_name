the Best
            

            "At this juncture, we all
should hope for the best."

            So concludes an especially
muddled editorial <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Feb. 25</TIMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> . The muddle was
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">understandable</ENAMEX>, given that the topic was on-again, off-again, on-again
Whitewater <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Independent Counsel</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth Starr</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal</ENAMEX> 's editorial
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">page</ENAMEX> spent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1980s</TIMEX> vilifying the whole idea of independent counsels as a
scandalous waste of money and an unconstitutional infringement upon executive
power. But that was when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawrence Walsh</ENAMEX> was investigating <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX>. Now
that it's a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democratic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> under investigation, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal</ENAMEX> is
naturally conflicted. Its former thundering constitutional anathemas are now
repositioned as genteel "doubts" about the "extra-legal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX>" of "an
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">institution</ENAMEX> still evolving."

            Still, "At this juncture, we
all should hope for the best" is remarkably unhelpful advice. Is there any
editorial ever written to which this last sentence could not be attached?
("Yes, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX>, there is a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Santa Claus</ENAMEX>. At this juncture, we all should hope
for the best.") Have we missed some other juncture, in the course of human
events, at which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal</ENAMEX> would not have recommended that we
all hope for the best? Will the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal</ENAMEX> inform its loyal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> when we
may abandon the strain of hoping for the best and return to the less exhausting
task of fearing the worst? Do we really need the distinguished Wall Street
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal</ENAMEX> editorial page to tell us to hope for the best? One might as well
turn to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal</ENAMEX> 's news pages to be told to "buy low, sell high."

            When
contemplating a high-risk course of action, such as hoping for the best, it is
always advisable to get a second opinion. At this juncture, we consulted Bill
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gates</ENAMEX>. Would he recommend hoping for the best? At this particular juncture<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">?</ENAMEX> "My
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dear</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fellow</ENAMEX>," he said, "Don't hope for the best. Demand the best." And
he added, "Buy low, sell high."

            

               Contest
            

            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A decade ago</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> of
this publication staged a contest in another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publication</ENAMEX> to name the
then-burgeoning <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Iran-Contra</ENAMEX> scandal. The premise was that scandal handles
ending in "-gate" had become too tiresome, and that "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iran-Contra</ENAMEX>" was too
clumsy. This turned out to be wrong on both counts, as that scandal came to be
called "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Irangate</ENAMEX>" by some and "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iran-Contra</ENAMEX>" by most. The winning name in that
contest--"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Iranamok</ENAMEX>"--was delightful, witty, and euphonious, but never took
off.

            Undaunted,
let's try again. Anybody got a good name for the now-burgeoning
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democratic</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asian</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Connection-Lincoln-Bedroom-Fund-Raising Scandal</ENAMEX>? Nothing
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">racist</ENAMEX>, please, and nothing (once again) ending in "-gate" (unless it's
really good). Post your suggestions to "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Fray</ENAMEX>," our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX>-discussion <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">forum</ENAMEX>, or send e-mail to slate@msn.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">com</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX> prize will be
a free <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>'s subscription to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate</ENAMEX> online (a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$19.95</NUMEX> value). Oh, and maybe
we'll throw in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate</ENAMEX> baseball cap.

            Slate
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> who recall <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Cassidy</ENAMEX>'s article <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few weeks</TIMEX> back about a lavish
"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Hollywood Party</ENAMEX>" he attended at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">home</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mogul</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medavoy</ENAMEX> might have enjoyed a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> feature about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Medavoy</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Feb.</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> described in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate</ENAMEX> piece was intended to signify <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medavoy</ENAMEX>'s
triumph over adversity: new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>, new job, and so on. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX>
piece, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medavoy</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">touchingly</ENAMEX> describes the kindness and generosity he discovered
during his adversity period: "Even the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">courier</ENAMEX> who used to bring films to me at
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">home</ENAMEX> said he'd be happy to bring them to me for nothing." What a heartwarming
story! Calling <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Capra</ENAMEX>! Imagine: a fallen <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mogul</ENAMEX> almost reduced to seeing
movies in a movie <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">theater</ENAMEX>, saved from this humiliation by a big-hearted
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">courier</ENAMEX>. If more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couriers</ENAMEX> took a moment to show a bit of human compassion for
the film <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producers</ENAMEX> in their midst, this old world would be a heckuva better
place.
