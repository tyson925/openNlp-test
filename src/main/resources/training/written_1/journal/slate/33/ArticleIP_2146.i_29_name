            Even many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supporters</ENAMEX> of the
recent welfare reform acknowledge a small flaw: The new arrangement requires
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">welfare</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX> to take jobs, but does nothing to assure that jobs will be
available. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s original notion of "ending welfare as we know
it" was to require work and also, if necessary, to supply it (plus training,
day care, health care, etc.). But that kind of welfare reform costs more, not
less, than just writing a check. So the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> version, which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinton</ENAMEX>
signed, leaves out the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> part of the equation. It supplies less money, not
more, to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, frees them to cut off benefits, and largely leaves the
details to them to figure out.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> face quite a
challenge in finding employment for all these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. And the federal
government, as is so often the case, makes the task even harder with
unnecessary, job-destroying regulations. Many of these regulations have come
under withering scrutiny in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX> by right-wing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">think tanks</ENAMEX>,
conservative editorial pages, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>. Yet <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> such
piece of federal red tape has escaped the criticism it deserves: the 13th
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Amendment to the Constitution</ENAMEX> ("Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude ...
shall exist within the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>"). Possibly due to misinterpretation by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activist judges</ENAMEX>, this job killer forbids <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX>--acting voluntarily,
of their own free will--to sell themselves into slavery. Or, to put it in terms
even a liberal might understand: It denies <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> the freedom to control their
own <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX>, albeit by selling them to someone else.

            Critics
of government welfare programs often ridicule the notion that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> would
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">starve</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> or die of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">untreated diseases</ENAMEX> without <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AFDC</ENAMEX>, food stamps,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicaid</ENAMEX>, etc. Private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">charity</ENAMEX>, they say, will provide for truly needy cases.
We may soon find out if this is correct. However, the logical defect is not
hard to spot. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> are unlikely to invest in the feeding and care of others
if they are not in a position to reap the benefits. But this defect can be
easily remedied.

            
An analogy might be made to the situation of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">elephants</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX>, under pressure from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> alarmed by the
destruction of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">elephant herds</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> banned the import of
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ivory</ENAMEX>. Most of the rest of the world soon followed, and the ivory trade was
devastated. The best thinking now is that this was a bad idea, because it
destroyed any incentive <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Africans</ENAMEX> might have to nurture and protect the elephant
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">herds</ENAMEX>. A better approach is to make sure that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">elephants</ENAMEX>' human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX>
have a commercial stake--through reasonably regulated hunting and ivory
sales--in seeing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">herds</ENAMEX> thrive. That way, you can "turn what heretofore have
been liabilities into assets," as an article in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Spectator</ENAMEX>
once explained.

            Similarly,
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>'s welfare <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX> can be turned from social liabilities into social
assets. The best way to assure that private <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> will come forward to
supply food and health care--and even job training!--to those who are about to
be freed from their debilitating dependency on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> is to allow these
giving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> to acquire an economic interest in the nutrition, health,
and skills of the former welfare <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX>. The employment arrangements that
have been traditional in this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">since 1863</TIMEX> are obviously not adequate to
the task, because there is nothing to stop a healthy, well-fed, well-trained
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>--once raised up to this desirable <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> through private-sector
initiative--from taking her <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">services</ENAMEX> elsewhere. Repealing the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">th</ENAMEX>
Amendment would solve this problem, by allowing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to contractually commit
their future good health and skills to an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employer</ENAMEX>.

            
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rich</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, it should be noted, already have
this ability. Various devices such as bonuses and stock options enable
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> to reasonably assure themselves of the continuing employment of key
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> without violating <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">the 13 th Amendment</ENAMEX>'s onerous ban on
what should more accurately be called "contracts of permanent employment." But
poor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are usually not in a position to demand stock options. Therefore,
they are unable to make a convincingly binding commitment to an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employer</ENAMEX>. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">13 th Amendment</ENAMEX> prevents it. As is so often the case, a seemingly
compassionate government regulation--enacted with the best of intentions--has
the effect of hurting the very people it was intended to help.

            Beyond its practical
effects, repeal of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">13 th Amendment</ENAMEX> would restore to every
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> what we now know is the most important freedom of all: freedom of
contract. The issue of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>'s God-given right to contract for his or her
permanent future employment is really an extension of the recently concluded
debate over the minimum wage. Although the reactionary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Labor</ENAMEX> and
Big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Government</ENAMEX> won that battle, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Majority Leader</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dick Armey</ENAMEX> was, of
course, absolutely right to note again and again (and again) that the effect of
a minimum wage is to deny <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> the opportunity to contract for their
services at a price <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employers</ENAMEX> are willing to pay.

            Clearly abolition of the
minimum wage, as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Armey</ENAMEX> and others advocate, would be an important step in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fulfilling America</ENAMEX>'s promise of a job for everyone who wants to work (and, for
that matter, everyone who doesn't want to work). But it is only a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step.
One might argue that abolishing the minimum wage is close enough to
relegalizing slavery, since it would free <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to work at whatever wage they
chose--including no wage at all. But this alone would not liberate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to
commit their future labor in a way that potential <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employers</ENAMEX> can reasonably be
expected to rely on. Only a contract can do that: a contract of permanent
future employment, which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employer</ENAMEX> can call upon the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> to use its
powers to enforce, if necessary. Now that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> has stopped guaranteeing
welfare benefits, a compassionate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> surely owes its poorest citizens
no less than this.
