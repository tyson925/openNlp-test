            Is the "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Sensation</ENAMEX>" show at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brooklyn Museum</ENAMEX> art or trash? Is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edmund</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morris</ENAMEX> biography of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald Reagan</ENAMEX> literature or a big mistake? Culturebox
doesn't know, and neither do you, dear <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX>, unless you're in the tiny
minority of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">New Yorkers</ENAMEX> who have seen the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or read the other. But that
doesn't stop <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mayor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rudolph Giuliani</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary Rodham Clinton</ENAMEX>, a majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senators</ENAMEX>, editorial page <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> around the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Culturebox's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleague</ENAMEX>

Chatterbox, and, of course, 
Culturebox from holding forth. And why should it? We know a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biographer</ENAMEX>'s
busted play or an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX>'s insult to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catholicism</ENAMEX> and good taste when we see
it.

            
               But how do we know? From a few nouns and adjectives in a
newspaper--"Virgin <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary</ENAMEX>," "<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">elephant dung</ENAMEX>," "bisected <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pig</ENAMEX>," "fictional
biographer"--and some overlit  images on the television screen. Since that's
all we need to come to a publishable understanding of a work of art--or
something that may or may not be art, we're not sure--we feel someone should
advise "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Sensation</ENAMEX>" <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chris Ofili</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edmund Morris</ENAMEX> that they've
each made a tragically stupid choice of profession. Think of the paintings they
could have avoided painting, the books they could have not written, the time
they could have saved not layering paint (or, in the case of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ofili</ENAMEX>, paint,
magazine pages, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">elephant dung</ENAMEX>) or doing research! If it's the idea of the
thing rather than the thing itself that's going to influence the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who
will influence the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX>, why type the words or cast the dung upon the canvas?
A press release would do as well.

            Actually, we who labor in the quick-take manufacturing industry--which is to
say, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pundits</ENAMEX> in general, Internet <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pundits</ENAMEX> in particular, and

                  Slate
                pundits most of all--know the following facts
to be self-evident, even though, in the heat of the chase, we prefer to ignore
them completely: The excerpt is not the book. The reproduction is not the work
of art. If they were, we wouldn't need <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX> or books. We could all study art
books for our art and read <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazines</ENAMEX> for our literature. Art <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> could skip
openings; book <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reviewers</ENAMEX> could rely on summaries in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Publishers Weekly</ENAMEX>.
Art and literature are not the rough approximations of themselves. They are the
sum of their parts, and their parts include formal properties and details that
do not translate into other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX>.

            So, for instance, what is elephant dung in the context of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ofili</ENAMEX>'s painting
of a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Nigerian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Virgin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary</ENAMEX>? <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Culturebox</ENAMEX> doesn't know, because she hasn't seen the
work, and neither do <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giuliani</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX>, but it is at least
possible that if she stood before the painting she would think: Aha!
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dung</ENAMEX> has a whole new meaning in the context of the sardonic primitivism,
the parodic putti-cum-naked-<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX>, the way the entire picture functions both
as an homage to and an ironic commentary on the Western <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cult</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madonna</ENAMEX> and
its role in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> culture. Or she might think: This is horseshit as well as
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">elephant dung</ENAMEX>!

            The practice of pronouncing without firsthand experience will not stop just
because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Culturebox</ENAMEX> has ranted about it, of course--nor should it. But she, for
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>, is so humbled by the wrath of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giuliani</ENAMEX>, whose know-nothingism is attached
to fearsome punitive powers, that she has joined her local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pundits</ENAMEX>
Anonymous. There she will place her faith in a higher power and pray that next
time she's tempted to discourse on that of which she knows absolutely nothing,
He'll shut her up. Maybe she'll drag <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chatterbox</ENAMEX> to the next meeting.
