            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John McCain</ENAMEX> isn't running in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iowa</ENAMEX>, and he may get clobbered in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hampshire</ENAMEX>. But he's <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">miles</NUMEX> ahead in the very first contest of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> campaign:
the press primary. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Journalists</ENAMEX> go weak in the knees around the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX>. The few who
have attempted to write debunking pieces about him have failed miserably. When
I set out to spend <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few days</TIMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX>, I promised my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> that
I wouldn't join in this collective swoon. That proved impossible. But perhaps I
can redeem myself a bit by examining the phenomenon.

            Why do the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hacks</ENAMEX> love <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain</ENAMEX>? You could start with our admiration for a
quality not many of us possess: physical courage. But I think the deeper
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">admiration</ENAMEX> is for the guts <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain</ENAMEX> showed in his <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Vietnamese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">captivity</ENAMEX> and which
he's shown consistently ever since. Everyone knows by now the story told in
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain</ENAMEX>'s book, how he voluntarily suffered <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five and a half years</TIMEX> as a <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">P.O.W.</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vietnam</ENAMEX> after refusing an early release. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain</ENAMEX> wasn't just a war <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hero</ENAMEX>. He was
a kind of spirit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> personified, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who writes in his book (click 
here for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ballot Box</ENAMEX> review) that he found freedom in captivity by
tormenting his torturers, even at the cost of additional abuse. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain</ENAMEX> is a
Faulknerian <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX>, in a very different sense than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Clinton</ENAMEX> is. And I
think that at this point, even those of us who think <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> has been a good
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> hunger for a successor more deserving of our respect.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Reporters</ENAMEX> who have covered <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> have seen <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Republican</ENAMEX>
politics considerably enlivened by this defiant character. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain</ENAMEX> is barely
tolerated by his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX>, and he hardly conceals his contempt for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trent Lott</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitch McConnell</ENAMEX>. He has broken with his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> over
campaign-finance reform, over legislation to punish cigarette <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">makers</ENAMEX>, and over
corporate welfare. There's a bit of the "strange new respect" phenomenon in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalists</ENAMEX> respond to these positions. When a conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politician</ENAMEX>
takes liberal stands, he is often described as having "grown." Yet <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain</ENAMEX>
remains a genuine conservative, the farthest to the right of any of the other
plausible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> in the race (a category that excludes the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">born-again Bible</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">slinger Steve Forbes</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Reporters respect</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain</ENAMEX> less because he takes liberal
positions than because of the way he puts his beliefs ahead of his career as a
matter of course.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain</ENAMEX> has been conducting himself in the same delightfully subversive way
as a candidate for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GOP</ENAMEX> nomination. There were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> in the campaign
brave enough or clueless enough to oppose ethanol subsidies beforehand. Both
faced the unappealing prospect of having to run in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iowa</ENAMEX> caucus with this
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">millstone</ENAMEX> around their necks. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Bradley</ENAMEX>, brazenly
changed his position to favor tax breaks for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol</ENAMEX>. The other, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John McCain</ENAMEX>
decided not to run in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iowa Caucuses</ENAMEX> rather than change his position--even
though forgoing the first contest makes his uphill struggle that much steeper.
"Every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> that I've observed in a race, if winning is the only
objective, they always end up doing something ," he told me. "They
compromise in order to experience some real or imagined short-term political
gain." <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain</ENAMEX> says this not with contempt, but with pity for those of his
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> who cannot resist political temptation.

            Then there's the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain</ENAMEX> charm. I doubt I'll enjoy any part of this <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>
campaign so much as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of days</TIMEX> spent as part of a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-person press
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">corps</ENAMEX> traveling with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain</ENAMEX>. He's funny, friendly, and far too candid for his
own good. Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> go off the record when they want to state the
obvious. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain</ENAMEX> doesn't go off the record at all, at least in my experience. He
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">behaves</ENAMEX>, in fact, more like a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilian</ENAMEX> talking about politics than a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politician</ENAMEX>
discussing politics. He does reverse spin: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unprompted</ENAMEX>, he tells me that his big
announcement speech <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the previous day</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Carolina</ENAMEX> was something of a
failure, describing himself as tired and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> as merely "polite." And
there aren't too many other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senators</ENAMEX>, let alone presidential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX>, who
will start a conversation (in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">van</ENAMEX>, leaving the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reagan Library</ENAMEX>) with the
line, "One of the many reasons I hate the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> ..." (the reason related to a
diplomatic insult to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Warren Christopher</ENAMEX> when he was <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary of state</ENAMEX>.)

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain</ENAMEX> has said other things in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent weeks</TIMEX> that would land another
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> in deep doo-doo. In a recent piece in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. News</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger Simon</ENAMEX>
quoted him referring to his <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">North Vietnamese</ENAMEX> prison <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guards</ENAMEX> as "the goddamn
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gooks</ENAMEX>." <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Reporters</ENAMEX> usually either put such indiscretions off the record on
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain</ENAMEX>'s behalf or congratulate him for making them. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> reason for this is the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">media</ENAMEX>'s sound instinct not to punish a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politician</ENAMEX> for being exceptionally
candid with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX>. Another is the feeling that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain</ENAMEX> has earned the right
to say whatever he wants. For those who have watched his career, his
outspokenness on the campaign trail appears as a refusal to be cowed by yet
another <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prison</ENAMEX> and its silly rules. As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Dole</ENAMEX> once said about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain</ENAMEX>, you
spend <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">five-and-</NUMEX>a-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> in a box, you get to say whatever you want.

            He also responds to the press. Unlike the inaccessible <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George W. Bush</ENAMEX>, you
can get to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain</ENAMEX> easily, and have a frank, intelligent discussion with him
about just about any topic. I've developed a minor obsession with how the
various <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> education plans don't make sense even on their own terms.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain</ENAMEX>'s flawed plan, like 
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>'s even more flawed plan, wouldn't give vouchers a fair test, because
it doesn't fund the voucher at anywhere near the cost of most private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>.
And if a voucher won't pay for private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>, it won't create any pressure on
public <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> to improve. I made this point to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain</ENAMEX> on a flight from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grand</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rapids</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mich.</ENAMEX>, to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reagan Library</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>. His initial response was
that while <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2,000</NUMEX>, the amount in his plan, wouldn't cover tuition at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sidwell</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Friends</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Andover</ENAMEX>, it would pay for many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catholic</ENAMEX> parochial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>. "I'm
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unembarrassed</ENAMEX> to tell you that one of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">my happiest days</TIMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX> was when
my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> was accepted in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catholic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>," he said. "I know she'll get a
quality education. She'll wear a uniform, and she'll be away from those little
bastards that are trying to get their hands on her."

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain</ENAMEX> then called across the aisle of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> to his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>. "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cindy</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">honey</ENAMEX>,
good <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX>. How much is our tuition for <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Meghan at Xavier?</ENAMEX>" Meghan, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>, is the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McCains</ENAMEX>' oldest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX>.

            "<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$6,100</NUMEX>," Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain</ENAMEX> answered. "Not including books or uniforms."

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain</ENAMEX> seemed surprised at how high it was. And the next thing I knew, he
was running with my criticism, trashing his own proposal. "It's one thing to
say we'll give everybody a choice," he said. "Well, if they can't get in, then
we'd better either provide incentives for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> to come into being where they
can afford it, or figure out a way to give them enough of a voucher where they
can." You could say that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain</ENAMEX> is to be faulted for not working out a better
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">education</ENAMEX> proposal in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> place. But in a way, being able to profit from
valid criticism is more important than being a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">master</ENAMEX> of policy detail. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinton</ENAMEX> health-care plan is a case in point.

            This points to a final press-friendly quality of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain</ENAMEX>'s: brilliant
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">flattery</ENAMEX>. It's fairly unusual, in my experience, for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politician</ENAMEX> to accept a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX>'s opinion that one of his major proposals is seriously flawed. It's
also gratifying to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Clinton</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">master</ENAMEX> of buttering up
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalists</ENAMEX> by quoting their books and articles back to them. But with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>,
the effort at seduction is transparent. You know he really hates the press, and
is forcing himself to try to win them over. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain</ENAMEX> flatters you, it
doesn't feel automatic or calculated. He truly likes us <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalists</ENAMEX>. It's his
fellow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senators</ENAMEX> he can't stand.
