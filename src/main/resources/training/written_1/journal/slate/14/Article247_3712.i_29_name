            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chatterbox</ENAMEX> continues to monitor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Weekly World News</ENAMEX> to see what kind of publisher
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger C. Altman</ENAMEX>, former deputy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX> and continuing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinton</ENAMEX>
intimate--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary</ENAMEX> had dinner at his home <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this past April</TIMEX>--turns out to be. (See
"
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Man Bites Dog</ENAMEX>," "
It's <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The End of the World</ENAMEX>, but Don't Panic," and "
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tabloid King Altman Answers Critics</ENAMEX>.") Apparently <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Altman</ENAMEX>'s the kind of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">publisher</ENAMEX> (no doubt he'd prefer to be called an investor , but anyway
it's his investment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>, Evercore
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Partners</ENAMEX>, that owns <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Weekly World News</ENAMEX> ) who drafts, or allows his
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">underlings</ENAMEX> to draft, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Clinton</ENAMEX> as a pitchman for his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tabloid</ENAMEX>--which this
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week</TIMEX> includes the headlines, "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Man Turns Into a Werewolf at Planetarium</ENAMEX> Lunar
Show!" and "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Mermaid Caught: Fisherman Nets Half-Human, Half-Fish in Jungle</ENAMEX>
River!" The current print issue carries a full-page house ad featuring a
photograph of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Clinton</ENAMEX> smiling and holding up a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Weekly World News</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">headlined</ENAMEX>, "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Alien Backs Clinton</ENAMEX>!" (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Political</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">junkies</ENAMEX> will remember this light
moment from the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX> campaign.) Alongside the photograph is the following
pitch: "<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Millions</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> read <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Weekly World News</ENAMEX> every
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week</TIMEX>--including the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>!"

            Memo to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Trade Commission</ENAMEX>: Isn't the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Weekly World News</ENAMEX> '
boast that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Clinton</ENAMEX> reads the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tabloid</ENAMEX> "<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every week</TIMEX>" a false-advertising
claim? Memo to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>: It's been <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chatterbox</ENAMEX>'s understanding that you
come down pretty hard on anyone who tries to use the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>'s image in a
commercial pitch--even if it's a joke (as, arguably, everything in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Weekly</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World News</ENAMEX> is intended to be). Are you going to come down on the former
deputy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">treasury secretary</ENAMEX>? Or are you afraid of offending a potential
fund-raiser for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> campaign? Would it change your mind if you
knew that this same potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fund-raiser</ENAMEX> ran a recent article in another of
his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publications</ENAMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Enquirer</ENAMEX> ) that said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary</ENAMEX>'s been having affairs in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>?
