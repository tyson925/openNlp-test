            My dear <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mim</ENAMEX>,

            I'm afraid that, out here, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brooklyn Museum</ENAMEX> story is
a trifle <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parish</ENAMEX> pump; although, as an ex-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manhattanite</ENAMEX>, I realize the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>
boroughs are one hell of a parish. I fear, though, I don't even know what
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">institution Phillip de Montebello</ENAMEX> represents, although I could hazard a guess.
I also have to confess that I don't much like <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">whatshisname</ENAMEX>'s dissected <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sheep</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">formaldehyde</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>, my local news informs me, we have our own small
piece of unacceptable art being trust upon us. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMV</ENAMEX> is issuing license
plates with a color picture of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald Reagan</ENAMEX> in a cowboy hat, and while this
may be a covert <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Random House</ENAMEX> promo for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> , I
fear the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAPD</ENAMEX> may well start treating the new plates as a mobile loyalty oath.
I once had an <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">L.A.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cop</ENAMEX> boast to me how he had apprehended a car <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">thief</ENAMEX> by simply
pulling over a black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> driving a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toyota</ENAMEX> with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grateful Dead</ENAMEX> bumper sticker.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">L.A.</ENAMEX> you have to take care what you affix to your <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">automobile</ENAMEX>. I often wonder
how the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goths</ENAMEX> fare who have a parody of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> on their <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> with
horns and the name <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Satan</ENAMEX>.

            Whenever <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Bowie</ENAMEX> releases product, I always have to
admire his media campaigning, and current <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> could learn a lot from
his methods. Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the weekend</TIMEX> we've seen him on both <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Saturday Night Live and the Late Show With</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Letterman</ENAMEX> . He stood up <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Howard Stern</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">last night</TIMEX>, which probably
garnered him more mileage that actually being on the show when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howard</ENAMEX> waxed
repeatedly wrathful, as, although <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David</ENAMEX> pleaded <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">flu</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">callers</ENAMEX> reported him
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">carousing</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mercer Kitchen</ENAMEX> until <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4 a.m.</TIMEX> A feature of any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bowie</ENAMEX> hype has
always been a lot of small planted gossip stories. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of these turns up in the
very handy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brit</ENAMEX> news digest <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Week</ENAMEX> , which claims
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David</ENAMEX> likes to travel on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> tube <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trains</ENAMEX>, but has to disguise himself by
wearing a hat and glasses and carrying a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX>. I guess that now
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Bowie</ENAMEX> is a public <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>, quoted on the stock exchange, he has to really
try. He not only has his own ego willing him to succeed, but also
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders</ENAMEX>.

            Although you may not be aware of it, the standard line
of the average conspiracy debunker is that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conspirators</ENAMEX> are not smart or
organized enough to hold the plot together. I think it's one of the tacks
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gerald Posner</ENAMEX> took in his book <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">JFK</ENAMEX> book, Case
Closed . My only answer is "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">No</ENAMEX>, they're not that smart. I'm onto them
already, aren't I?" I must admit, however, that I may have been wrong about
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George W.</ENAMEX> being a "self-admitted cokehead." I suspect I have misread <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maureen</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dowd</ENAMEX>. Would a self-admitted drunk and alleged cokehead be better?

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald</ENAMEX> is well known in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">SoCal</ENAMEX>, but in the
convolutions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reform Party</ENAMEX>, my money is still on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesse Ventura</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNN</ENAMEX> is
promising to air an interview with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Annette Bening</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this afternoon</TIMEX>, but I may be
asleep. The teaser was "whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> may run for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>." The tease started
me thinking about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bening</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">first lady</ENAMEX>. Didn't we see her naked in either
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bugsy</ENAMEX> or The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grifters</ENAMEX> ?
That would be a decided <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">first lady</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Love</ENAMEX>,
Mick
