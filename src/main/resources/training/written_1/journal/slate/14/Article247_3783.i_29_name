            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Archives</ENAMEX>' latest release of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> tapes is, as
usual, a bracing antidote to historical revisionism. Whenever the academic
world is tempted to adopt a more favorable view of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX>, new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nixon</ENAMEX>
tapes always seem to appear that squelch the impulse. (To read

                  Slate
               's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Greenberg</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX> revisionists, click here.) The theme of the
latest release, according to articles in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> , is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX>'s anti-Semitism. We already
knew, of course, that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX> had a pathological hatred of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX>. (Scroll down to
the bottom of "
Deep <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Throat: The Game Is Afoot</ENAMEX>" to see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX>'s outrage on discovering that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark Felt</ENAMEX>, a high-ranking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> believed by both <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chatterbox</ENAMEX> to
have been <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Deep Throat</ENAMEX>, is <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX>.) But even <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chatterbox</ENAMEX> was taken aback at the
virulence of some of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX>'s comments on the new tapes--which, sadly, are not
available either in audio or in transcript form on the Web. (The best
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chatterbox</ENAMEX> can do is refer you to the quotations in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> stories, which were based on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX>'
own transcriptions.)

            Here's a fairly stunning snippet from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Lardner</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX>
piece:

            

               
                  <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> "is full of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX>," the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> asserted. "Most <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> are
disloyal." He made exceptions for some of his top <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aides</ENAMEX>, such as national
security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adviser</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Kissinger</ENAMEX>, his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counsel</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leonard Garment</ENAMEX>, and
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of his speechwriters, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Safire</ENAMEX>, and then added:
               

               "But, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob</ENAMEX>, generally speaking, you can't trust the bastards. They turn on
you. Am I wrong or right?"

               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Haldeman</ENAMEX> agreed wholeheartedly. "Their whole orientation is against you. In
this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>, anyway. And they are smart. They have the ability to do
what they want to do--which is to hurt us."

            

            And here's a similarly outrageous example from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Irvin Molotsky</ENAMEX>'s story in the
Times :

            

               
                  "The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> non-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> in the communist conspiracy," [<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX>] said,
"were [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whittaker</ENAMEX>] <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chambers</ENAMEX> and [<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alger</ENAMEX>] <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hiss</ENAMEX>. Many felt that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hiss</ENAMEX>
was. He could have been a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>, but he was not by religion. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX>
non-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX>. Every other one was a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jew</ENAMEX>. And it raised hell with us."
               

            

            Most stunning of all, however, was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX>' assertion that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Nixon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Library</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Birthplace in Yorba Linda</ENAMEX>, which purports to be a serious research
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">institution</ENAMEX>, "issued a statement saying the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> was not
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-Semitic</ENAMEX> " [<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">italics</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chatterbox</ENAMEX>'s]. Chatterbox, always wary of
paraphrase, decided to take a closer look at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nixon Library</ENAMEX>'s statement,
which you can read by going to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Library</ENAMEX> Web site and clicking on "The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House Tape</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Recordings</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February to July 1971</TIMEX>: A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guide</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Major Themes</ENAMEX> and
Personalities."

            Actually, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nixon Library</ENAMEX> document nowhere says that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX> was not
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">anti-Semitic</ENAMEX>. The phrases "anti-Semite" and "<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-Semitic</ENAMEX>" don't appear in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Library</ENAMEX> document at all , aside from this passage:

            

               
                  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX>, after expressing the view that most <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish Americans</ENAMEX> are
insisting that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Administration</ENAMEX> go along with what he regards as <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israeli</ENAMEX>
intransigence on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Suez Canal</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mideast</ENAMEX> peace issues while refusing
to give him support on his <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vietnam</ENAMEX> policy, remarks: "If anybody who's been in
this chair ever had reason to be anti-Semitic
                   [italics
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chatterbox</ENAMEX>'s] , I did." <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">H.R. Haldeman</ENAMEX> replies: "That's for damn sure." The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> continues: "And I'm not, you know what I mean? Accepted, I'm not
pro-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX>; I'm not going to let <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX>'s tail <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wag</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX>."
               

            

            
               However , the overall thrust of the portion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nixon Library</ENAMEX>
document that interprets <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX>'s remarks on "<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish Americans</ENAMEX>" is indeed to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">downplay Nixon</ENAMEX>'s comic-book anti-Semitism:

            

               
                  As with his attitudes toward <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African Americans</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX>'s words
about the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> on these tapes show that his basic sense of
compassion and support for these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> tends to co-exist with terminology
from an earlier time.
               

            

            An earlier time? This was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1971</TIMEX>, not <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1917</TIMEX>! Attitudes toward <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">African Americans</ENAMEX>
were appalling (many would say they still are), but attitudes toward
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> --particularly in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>--were fairly benign. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nixon Library</ENAMEX>
seems eager to blame <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Haldeman</ENAMEX> for egging <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX> on:

            

               
                  It should be noted that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX>'s comments regarding lack of
political support for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Administration</ENAMEX> among many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish Americans</ENAMEX> frequently
occur when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Haldeman</ENAMEX> is present, and that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Haldeman</ENAMEX> is generally quick to note
when some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> who is the subject of adverse comment happens to be <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jewish</ENAMEX>
...
               

            

            It should further be noted that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Haldeman</ENAMEX>'s eagerness to enable <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jew</ENAMEX>-hating, which may have stemmed from his tendency to pander to all of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX>'s worst instincts, or may have reflected sincere anti-Semitism of his
own--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chatterbox</ENAMEX> has no idea--does nothing to mitigate the appalling bigotry of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX>'s comments. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nixon Library</ENAMEX>'s gloss on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX>'s remarks about <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> ends
by pointing out that despite <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX>'s initial misgivings about appointing
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herbert Stein</ENAMEX> to chair the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Council on Economic Advisors</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stein</ENAMEX>, who prior to
his recent death was
a 
                  Slate
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">contributor</ENAMEX>, was also <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX>),

            

               
                  the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX>, within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX>, would make <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stein</ENAMEX> his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CEA</ENAMEX>--just as he would give the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> unequivocal, life-saving support in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">1973 Arab-Israeli War</ENAMEX>. * The actions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX>, as well as the
substantial documentary record of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nixon Administration</ENAMEX>, should always be
kept in mind when evaluating his words on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> tapes.
               

            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chatterbox</ENAMEX> won't dispute that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this century</TIMEX> has seen bigger anti-Semites than
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Nixon</ENAMEX>. On the other hand, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX>'s comments about <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> make, say, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pat</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buchanan</ENAMEX>'s seem comparatively benign. (This is not to excuse <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buchanan</ENAMEX>, who in
the latest issue of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">George</ENAMEX> --OK, in a profile written by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chatterbox</ENAMEX>--implores, preposterously, that if he were an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-Semite</ENAMEX>, "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Would I</ENAMEX>
have a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> who deals with my heart? Would I have a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">broker</ENAMEX>?")
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chatterbox</ENAMEX> would think that part of the burden of working at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nixon Library</ENAMEX>
is conceding that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Nixon</ENAMEX>, while no doubt misunderstood in many ways, was
one wicked anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Semite</ENAMEX>. But a glance back at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nixon Library</ENAMEX>'s Web site
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">reminds Chatterbox</ENAMEX> that for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nixon Library</ENAMEX>, the fundraising (hence the need
