            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Two weeks ago</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesse Gelsinger</ENAMEX> died while undergoing
experimental gene therapy treatment for a metabolic disease of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX>. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Institutes of Health</ENAMEX> are now reviewing the safety of gene therapy
trials. What is gene therapy?

            Genes are hereditary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> that carry nature's blueprints for making the
multitude of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that build enzymes and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> chemicals to sustain
life. Human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">beings</ENAMEX> have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between 50,000 and 150,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>--the number is hotly
debated among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX>--and many <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> can be linked to defects in one or
more of these genes. There are inherited defects, like those that cause cystic
fibrosis, and acquired defects, like those that cause some forms of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> who have genetic-based diseases typically take <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> that treat their
symptoms, not the cause.

            It may take <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX> or even <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX> to completely understand the
relationship between genes and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>. But where the connection is understood,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> are devising gene therapies that aim to eliminate <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> by
introducing healthy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (isolated and reproduced in the laboratory) to
compensate for the defective ones.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> way to deliver healthy genes is by placing them inside a tamed virus
that in turn can enter the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s affected cells. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gelsinger</ENAMEX>'s case, the
goal was to introduce therapeutic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> into his liver cells. His cause of
death is still a mystery: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> theory is that the virus was still active and may
have killed him. This therapeutic trial has been suspended pending an
investigation.

            Theoretically, gene therapy could be used to cure infectious diseases like
<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> by giving cells extra defense mechanisms.

            Though the benefits of gene therapy are theoretically large, none of the
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozens</NUMEX> of trials in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> (or elsewhere) has achieved a long-term cure for
any ailment. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> obstacle is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>'s natural defense: The immune system
recognizes the virus as a threat and attacks it. Another is that the cells
engineered by therapy often do not produce enough of the needed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> to cure
the disorder.

of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Human</ENAMEX> Genome
Project for an exhaustive look at the world of genomics.)
