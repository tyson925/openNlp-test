            There's something almost comical about the recent frustration over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bank</ENAMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>'s refusal to take action to lower the value of the yen, which has
soared in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past month</TIMEX> against the rest of the world's currencies, including
most obviously the dollar. The kind of action the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX> would have to take to
weaken the yen, after all, is precisely the kind of action it would have to
take to jump-start the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> economy. And if it wasn't going to take action
to do the latter, it's hard to see why we should it expect to act to do the
former.

            The impact on a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>'s economy of the value of its currency is, of
course, very complicated, primarily because any <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> is made up both of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX>, who like it when the currency is strong, making imported goods
cheap, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producers</ENAMEX>, who like it when the currency is weaker, making their
exports more affordable. But former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Rubin</ENAMEX> always said
simply that a strong dollar was in the best interests of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, so
you're probably pretty safe to leave it at that.

            But that doesn't mean that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> needs to be too obsessed with
the recent fall of the dollar against the yen. In the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> place, currency
markets are markets , which means that they will occasionally overreact
(as currency <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> seem to have done to the news that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> economy
actually grew in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last quarter</TIMEX>, albeit at a minuscule rate). In the second
place, the dollar has remained strong against the world's other major
currencies. So concerns that a weak dollar will spark inflationary pressures
are overplayed.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX>, on the other hand, have reason to worry about the yen's
becoming too strong when their economy is still barely limping along. Much of
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>'s industrial production remains concentrated in export industries, and a
too-strong yen will hurt them. At the same time, it might be tempting for
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> to see the value of the yen as a referendum on their economy.
If they do, that'll hold back the kinds of changes <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> needs.

            The best chance the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX> has of lowering the value of the yen--and it would
be only a chance--would be to effectively print a lot of new currency. (It
can't act to manipulate interest rates, since rates are already near <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>.)
This would, of course, have an inflationary impact. But, as I've said here
before (and as 
                  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Krugman</ENAMEX> has said many times before),
that would not be a bad thing. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> remains caught in a liquidity trap, which
means that even though money is effectively free, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are not using it to
invest or spend. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> way of encouraging them to do so is to make the cost of
not spending higher than the cost of saving, which is to say making a
commitment to inflation.

            For all this, though, we need to stop expecting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bank of Japan</ENAMEX> to step
in: It is not interested in taking action either to spark growth or drive down
the yen. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX> takes its devotion to inflation-fighting very seriously, and
it does not believe the admittedly heretical view that sometimes a little
inflation is not a bad thing. So if the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> is counting on the bank
to help save the dollar, it should stop and look to something else. Maybe we
could worry about the trade deficit.
