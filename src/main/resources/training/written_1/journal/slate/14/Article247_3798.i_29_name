            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dear Steve</ENAMEX>:

             <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hey</ENAMEX>, good illustrations. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> thing that really bummed
me about being paired up with you to do this <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Breakfast Table gig</ENAMEX> was knowing
that you'd effortlessly outdraw my sorry ass, and that's even when you've got a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">color</ENAMEX> pallette tied behind your back. Well, at least I have my new,
post-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Central Asian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diet Plan</ENAMEX> waistline--lose <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">36 pounds</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28 days</TIMEX>! (really)--to
comfort me.

            I'm glad you brought up the weirdness of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Quincy Bush</ENAMEX> (yes! let's
nominate the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">frat-boy son</ENAMEX> of a loser do-nothing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>!) campaign. On my Los
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Angeles</ENAMEX> radio show <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this past Saturday</TIMEX> I did a facetious "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Welcome to the Left</ENAMEX>"
bit embracing GWB's new move to the progressive side. I announced that I had it
on good authority that he was going to end capitalism, nationalize industry,
eliminate pay inequity, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institute</ENAMEX> forced collectivization, all while
playing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Billy Bragg</ENAMEX>'s "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Waiting for the Great Leap Forward</ENAMEX>" underneath my
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">monologue</ENAMEX>. I went too far by reminding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> turned out not to be
lying about being a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">New Democrat</ENAMEX> (i.e., conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrat</ENAMEX>), so perhaps <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>
is telling the truth about really caring about poor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hey</ENAMEX>, maybe he's
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rebelling</ENAMEX> against <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> late in life.)

            In any event, my lines were jammed with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">callers</ENAMEX> seemingly unaware of the
joke; several worried aloud that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 4</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">th</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">farms</ENAMEX> were around the
corner from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next November</TIMEX>. Ah, if only it were true. But the point here remains
sound--the two-party system, perhaps the most stupid political structure ever
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">conceived</ENAMEX>, is dead if you can convince <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> is a leftist and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> can still pass himself off as a liberal after pushing through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NAFTA</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GATT</ENAMEX>, and that rancid welfare-reform bill--not to mention signing countless
death warrants as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arkansas</ENAMEX>. Personally I'm a fan of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX>-style
parliamentary democracy; even fringes of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">electorate</ENAMEX> get represented. But at
least with single-party <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">dictatorship</ENAMEX>, you get efficiency. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> give you
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">paralysis</ENAMEX>, and worse than that, the illusion of choice between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> virtually
identical wholly owned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">subsidiaries</ENAMEX> of corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>.

            As for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diva</ENAMEX> (now I'm calling her that!), anyone who worked on that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dukakis</ENAMEX> campaign is by definition a moron. I walked in, and right out, of his
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York HQ</ENAMEX> when I saw how disorganized they were (nobody was there to answer
the phone or unlock the front door), and that was the last time I ever
considered participating in allegedly organized <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> politics.

            Very truly,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ted</ENAMEX>
