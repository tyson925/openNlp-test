            And so, dear <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mim</ENAMEX>,

            Just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> more cup of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX> for the road, regrettably
leaving so much I haven't mentioned.

            Like how I fear every attempt at universal health care
will be sandbagged by the insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>. Like how an <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> doctor
demonstrated that the pharmaceutical industry charges us <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to 1,000</NUMEX> percent
more than they do for the same <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medication</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. Like how <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kathie Lee</ENAMEX> and
other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sweatshop profiteers</ENAMEX> should thank those <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>-sponsored death squads of the
'80s, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers</ENAMEX> who footed the bill. Like how pleased I was with the
e-mail on drug legalization. Like campaign funding reform and the TV industry.
Like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan Quayle</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Letterman</ENAMEX> . Like how come
capitalism forgot the need for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumer</ENAMEX>? Like how the religious
right is now gunning for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Airlines</ENAMEX>' gay-rights policy. Like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">will Joey</ENAMEX>
survive the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> series of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Sopranos</ENAMEX> ?

            But I agree that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">k.j.</ENAMEX>, who called us "overpaid," needs
to be set straight. This is the creative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX>, just ask
my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">landlord</ENAMEX>. If it's any consolation, a "dissembling, conflicted blowhard" is
also known as an "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX>" where I come from. I'm also starting to suspect that
pound-the-pundit is the other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of the collective game, and goes with the
territory. It's like the sideshow bozo above the tank of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>; if they don't
hurl the balls, we don't have a show. (We'll see if they ask me back.)

            On the matter of armed overthrow of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>, I
don't think I can help you. I believe I gave my word to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INS</ENAMEX> that I wouldn't
do that kind of thing when I applied for my green card. Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a gentleman</TIMEX>'s
word must still be his bond, the best I can offer is to stand romantically on a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hill</ENAMEX>, the breeze flapping my duster coat around my legs, rolling a quarter
across my knuckles, and watching as crack assault units of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Hello Kitty</ENAMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trenchcoat Mafia</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">zombie</ENAMEX>-teen ninjas penetrate the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beltway</ENAMEX>.

            That's only leaves me to thank you for making the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">suggestion</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Susan</ENAMEX> for spotting some useful news items, and 
                  Slate
                for having me in for the
ride.

            Thank you. Thank you very much.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mick</ENAMEX> has left the table.
