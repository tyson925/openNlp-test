            Like some smutty art film of
a bygone era, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Crash</ENAMEX> arrives on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX> screens preceded by lurid
headlines--hailed at <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Cannes</ENAMEX>, banned in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX>, its <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> release nearly aborted
by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ted Turner</ENAMEX>. The rumors started even before the movie went into production,
without the benefit of hired publicists. After all, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> edition
of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1973</TIMEX> novel by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J.G. Ballard</ENAMEX> on which the film is based was pulped in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">toto</ENAMEX>, its <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">publisher</ENAMEX> announced it and then balked, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> that
finally undertook it seems to have dispatched most of the run directly to the
remainder tables (I bought my copy not long after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publication</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">79 cents</NUMEX>). It
concerns, of course, the eroticism of automobile accidents. Could you conceive
of anything more sicko-weird? But <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> are sexual objects, obviously, and if
their essence is speed, consummation can be achieved only through impact. Every
car commercial on television is an invitation to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Liebestod</ENAMEX> .

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ballard</ENAMEX>'s
complex, image-driven fiction <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partakes</ENAMEX> of surrealism, hovers within the orbits
of sci-fi, and laps at the outr√©. Change "fiction" to "movies," and the same
formula can apply to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Cronenberg</ENAMEX>, whose best work ( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Videodrome</ENAMEX> ,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dead Ringers</ENAMEX> ) is as disturbing as any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">avant-garde</ENAMEX> literature you care to
name, even as it has been commercially viable. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cronenberg</ENAMEX>'s films have gone
places and done things that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s gutless <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">independents</ENAMEX> could never imagine.
Who else could have filmed <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Crash</ENAMEX> ? Who else would have wanted to?

            His adaptation is extremely faithful to the novel. Its
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">protagonist</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Ballard</ENAMEX> (the book's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hero</ENAMEX>, played by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Spader</ENAMEX>, bears the
same name as its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>), is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producer</ENAMEX> of TV commercials. He and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Catherine</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Deborah Kara Unger</ENAMEX>), have one of those open marriages. Driving home
from the set <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James</ENAMEX> skids into oncoming traffic and crashes head-on
into another <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>, killing its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">driver</ENAMEX>, whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">widow</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helen Remington</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holly</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hunter</ENAMEX>), stares in shock. During their respective <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> sojourns, both
survivors encounter <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vaughan</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elias Koteas</ENAMEX>), a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientist</ENAMEX> who had been a
well-known TV <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personality</ENAMEX> until a near-fatal <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">motorcycle</ENAMEX> accident made him
obsessed with the erotic possibilities of highway crashes.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vaughan</ENAMEX>'s
preoccupation leads him to not only ponder the sexually charged road deaths of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">famous</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Dean</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jayne Mansfield</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albert Camus</ENAMEX>), but to hang around
accident sites, photographing them and later replicating the contorted postures
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> in his trysts with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prostitutes</ENAMEX>. As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helen</ENAMEX>, and eventually
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Catherine</ENAMEX> are drawn into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vaughan</ENAMEX>'s world, they discover that he leads a cult of
sorts, which includes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gabrielle</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rosanna Arquette</ENAMEX>), who gravitated toward
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vaughan</ENAMEX> after an accident that left her encased in a complicated
leather-and-steel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> brace. The votaries smoke pot, watch test-crash footage,
read <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX> of pathology, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">re-enact</ENAMEX> celebrated accidents.

            
In the movie as in the book, much of the action
thereafter consists of an increasingly intense spiral of couplings among these
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parties</ENAMEX>, punctuated by tearing metal and shattering glass and inevitably
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">climaxing</ENAMEX> in death. The book, however, is internally powered by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ballard</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">patented</ENAMEX> transformation of cold into hot, turning medical and automotive jargon
into spectacularly baroque metaphors: "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thinking</ENAMEX> of the extensor rictus of her
spine during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">orgasm</TIMEX>, the erect hairs on her undermuscled thighs, I stared at
the stylized <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX>'s medallion visible in the photographs, the contoured
flanks of the window pillars." A movie can't really do that sort of thing.

            Of
course, comparisons don't get any more invidious than those between movies and
their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> novels, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> should abjure the temptation. I purposely
hadn't reread the book before seeing the film, and furthermore resolved to
forget <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cronenberg</ENAMEX>'s previous adaptation of a famously impossible work of
literature, the contrived mess he fashioned from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William S. Burroughs</ENAMEX>' Naked
Lunch . But as much as I enjoyed Crash the movie, I found that my
keenest pleasure came from imagining the potential reactions of others. I
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pictured</ENAMEX>, say, its eventual pay-per-view screening being accidentally beamed
out on the wavelength of a devotional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX>. Although the frissons
were all present and accounted for, there was something missing.

            This isn't the fault of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cast</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spader</ENAMEX> is a bit too
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sincere</ENAMEX> and boyish to play the jaded libertine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ballard</ENAMEX>, but he's a fine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actor</ENAMEX>
and unquestionably game. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unger</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arquette</ENAMEX> are well cast, and the protean
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hunter</ENAMEX> extraordinarily so. Koteas was born for his role, just the right mix of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">crudity</ENAMEX> and sophistication. The cinematography is surgically precise, the
editing crisp, the music moody and unobtrusive. The dialogue, much of it
straight from the book, is full of terse humor (when a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cop</ENAMEX> comes by to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interrogate Vaughan</ENAMEX> about a hit-and-run, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Catherine</ENAMEX> brushes him off: "Vaughan
isn't interested in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pedestrians</ENAMEX>"). Nevertheless, the movie seems all too
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reducible</ENAMEX>. Despite such calculated outrages as the scene where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James</ENAMEX> fucks the
wound in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gabrielle</ENAMEX>'s leg, the film's darkest images are the views of endless
traffic on the arterial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roadways</ENAMEX> that make up the entire landscape around the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ballards</ENAMEX>' high-rise flat.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> major
reason for this is that car-crash <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">erotica</ENAMEX> has become so routinely available in
the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">quarter century</TIMEX> since the book was written. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who wouldn't dream
of seeing Crash derive the very same thrills covertly, from an
inexhaustible supply of PG titles ranging from The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Connection</ENAMEX> to
the latest generic <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Lethal Weapon</ENAMEX> ; they will, of course, hotly deny any
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tumescence</ENAMEX>. And Crash can often seem like <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Lethal Weapon</ENAMEX> , plus
sodomy <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">minus</NUMEX> plot. For a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">filmmaker</ENAMEX> who in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Videodrome</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dead</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Ringers</ENAMEX> so elegantly broached the unspeakable, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cronenberg</ENAMEX> has here made a
picture that is all surface. For purposes of comparison, rent the video of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jean-Luc Godard's Weekend</ENAMEX> --amid all the chatter is a brief scene of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mireille Darc</ENAMEX> emerging from a flaming wreck that, as a crash-sex icon, beats
anything in <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Crash</ENAMEX> . And in the mostly ludicrous <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</TIMEX> opera-video movie
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aria</ENAMEX> is a sequence by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ken Russell</ENAMEX>, of all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, that conveys sheer
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">rococo</ENAMEX> horror: A young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> sees herself being anointed and bedecked with
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">jewels</ENAMEX>, but we then see that she is in an emergency ward, and that her jewels
are in reality car-crash wounds.

            
In his book, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ballard</ENAMEX> was not only toying with
some kind of ultimate transgression; he was also responding to the arguments
advanced by pop art. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Rosenquist</ENAMEX>'s paintings and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Hamilton</ENAMEX>'s
drawings of rearranged <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> parts could hardly be more explicitly sexual (a
finger poised by a dash-mounted gearshift, a talk balloon filled with an
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">orgasmic</ENAMEX> "Aah!": <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hamilton</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1962</TIMEX>). Another pop <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Chamberlain</ENAMEX>,
exhibited the actual voluptuous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hulks</ENAMEX> of wrecks. It is tempting to imagine
Crash as if it had been made <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a generation ago</TIMEX>, starring <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laurence Harvey</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vanessa Redgrave</ENAMEX>. The pop works still look great, but their implicit text
is no longer news, having filtered down to the pure stimulus-response of all
those <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Lethal Weapons</ENAMEX> . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ballard</ENAMEX>'s novel goes further, forcing the reader
to acknowledge complicity--every consumer a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pervert</ENAMEX>. The movie, though, is only
a movie, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cronenberg</ENAMEX> lets the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewer</ENAMEX> walk away momentarily stunned, but
unscathed.
