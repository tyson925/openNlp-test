            Inventing a holy <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">land</ENAMEX>,who
would have settled for theseneutral hills bare except for scrub and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sage</ENAMEX>,a sky
unclouded as impenetrable,now and then the timeless Bedouin tent--which would
explain, along that ridge,a straggling flock of goatswith stretched-out,
walking shadows?

            And now the eastern
approaches. Yet nothingabout the frontier's fenced compoundssuggests the
traveller en route elsewhereshould <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stop</ENAMEX>--even if stepping on the gascan't do
much toward cancelling those pictures,the color of pain, a visual undersong
...Once coppergreen expanses of waterslide into view, though, no one could
failto sense the difference in beingbelow sea level--air heavyin the ear,
oxygen-rich, cool, dry,scented with desert, and holy enough.A hand dipped in
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water pondersthe</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viscous</ENAMEX> feel of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">minerals</ENAMEX> in solution,and little tumuli of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">salts</ENAMEX> and carbonatesbuild a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">submarine</ENAMEX> city sprawlingfor miles under the
hammered-metal surface.On a shore <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hazed</ENAMEX> with distance, neat rowsof date palms
identify themselveswith a green herringbone frond and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ripen foodstuffs</ENAMEX> for,
say, the heavenly banquet.Ritual ablution even so has coatedyour skin with a
pale silt glove;and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">sea</ENAMEX> and desert are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>.

            Remember the hands,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">calloused</ENAMEX> and sunburned,of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Quumran</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scribes</ENAMEX>, seated at a cave's
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mouth</ENAMEX>,negotiating light that dawn brought backwith the promise of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">deliverance</ENAMEX>.Shadow and light, black fireon white fire, the unswerving
word,conferring a sacred indifferenceto an urban, merely visual appeal.The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">caves</ENAMEX>, dark sockets in a cliff wall,return no one's gaze <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>,even if they
once did seea mountain range of crumpled felt,castiron eagles fixed on
approaching spears,and a southbound <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jordan</ENAMEX> feeding the samefluid <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>, ever
moremineral, ever heavier with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX>.
