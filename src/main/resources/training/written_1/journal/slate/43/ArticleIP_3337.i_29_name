            By Abdi
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ali</ENAMEX>

            
               (posted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday, July</TIMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX>; to be composted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday, July 30</TIMEX>)
            

            The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> floor apartment
was home; Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sargunam</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">uncle</ENAMEX>.

            Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sargunam</ENAMEX> taught
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> at the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">th</ENAMEX> standard, some teaching

            At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">college</ENAMEX>, and private
lessons to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreigners</ENAMEX>--you, I and others.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mona</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Huda</ENAMEX> and you stayed
with her; I may have for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a week</TIMEX> or two

            Before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aruldhases</ENAMEX> were
found, and for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about a year</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mum</ENAMEX> sent

            Money and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> umbrellas
(at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time!) through her. Seriously,

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vocation</ENAMEX> began here--the
story of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">frogs</ENAMEX>,

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Osaka</ENAMEX>, the other
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kyoto</ENAMEX>, eyes on the back

            Of their heads. "From two
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">frogs</ENAMEX> ...," proper,

            Lady Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sargunam</ENAMEX>,
alternately coughing--

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mannered</ENAMEX>, easing her
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lemon</ENAMEX>-wedged specs to her nose,

            "Set to visit the other's
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>." Their visit is short

            On a fictional hill
between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Befuddled,</ENAMEX>

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> are alike, they
turn, return <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">home</ENAMEX>.

            I learned the story by
heart, also by heart Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sargunam</ENAMEX>,

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Scholar-wife</ENAMEX>, no
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">homemaker</ENAMEX>, sitting for dinner caf√©-style.

            You left, enrolled in a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catholic school</ENAMEX> in the hills. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aruldhas</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX>,

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beulah</ENAMEX>, pushed me,
rewriting words forty-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fifty</NUMEX> times, literally mugging

            As we used to say. We met
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> last time, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Strand Hotel</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bombay</ENAMEX>;

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quizzing</ENAMEX> each other--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mona</ENAMEX>
was untouchable in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> civics,

            My knowledge of anatomy
defended the reputation of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Adventist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>,

            And you owned with skill
images, permanent stay of faith,

            Placed over blackboards in
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">classrooms</ENAMEX>. "The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Living-God</ENAMEX>," you said,

            Making plain a mystery,
"is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-flavor ice-cream: <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">strawberry</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chocolate</ENAMEX> and vanilla."

            (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Plain</ENAMEX>-mystery by which
your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> is now named

            After the vegetarian
dream-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultant</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nebuchadnezzar.</ENAMEX>)

            Frog-fate, or no
frog-fate, swear I see at times one

            In these <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kampala</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mogadishu</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jeddah</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nairobi</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX>.

            I think in your den in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oslo</ENAMEX>, surrounded by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sheiks</ENAMEX> requested by your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>,

            You see the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lamb</ENAMEX>-lamp lit.
