            Integrity can be a drag in
an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actor</ENAMEX>, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jennifer Jason Leigh</ENAMEX>--who plays <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Catherine Sloper</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heroine</ENAMEX> of
the new adaptation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry James</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Washington Square</ENAMEX> --has so often and
so vividly demonstrated. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leigh</ENAMEX> plays unpleasant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX>, as in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Georgia</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kansas City</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>), she is as unpleasant as
all get-out. When she played <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dorothy Parker</ENAMEX> in Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Parker</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vicious</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Circle</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX>), she faithfully reproduced the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX>'s vocal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cadences</ENAMEX> at the
expense of such trifles as variety and intelligibility. Her work can be
unleavened by imagination. Compare her turn as a government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rush</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX>) to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jodie Foster</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the same year</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Silence of the</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lambs</ENAMEX> . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Foster</ENAMEX> revealed her character's vulnerability by indirection--by how
hard the young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> labored to project strength. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leigh</ENAMEX> chose to telegraph the
vulnerability: She was such a radiant mess that no superior in his right mind
would have sent her undercover.

            I
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interviewed Leigh for Vogue</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eight years ago</TIMEX>, before her acting went to
hell. I liked her as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> and admired her gutsiness--her willingness to
work without a net, to throw herself headlong into a part even if it meant
falling a great distance onto her face. But a weird, masochistic streak has
emerged in her performances. She now makes a fetish of falling on her face. She
might even want to be loved for falling on her face.

            As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Catherine</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James</ENAMEX>' plain, artless heiress to whom life
has simultaneously dealt a very good and a very bad hand, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leigh</ENAMEX> is so busy
projecting her plainness and artlessness that she neglects, for most of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">film</ENAMEX>, to pull the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> in. Her <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Catherine</ENAMEX> has no center of gravity: She
doesn't walk when she can lurch, weave, or collide with objects, her balance
shifting precariously. Her responses, meanwhile, are queerly private, as if she
were unsure of how to act out her own emotions. All this is by design, of
course, and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">an era</TIMEX> when "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">You like me</ENAMEX>! You really like me!" is the mantra of
most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actors</ENAMEX>, that design can seem brave and original. What isn't by design is
the mass of neurotic actressy mannerisms, which function like layer upon layer
of wax buildup. You can't see into <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Catherine</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soul</ENAMEX>--like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> on wax, your
gaze beads.

            In part
this is the fault of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agnieszka Holland</ENAMEX>. Like her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">star</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holland</ENAMEX>
has done everything right, on paper. In <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Washington Square</ENAMEX> , the early
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19 th -century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> trappings never smack of the sound <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stage</ENAMEX>, and
each scene is judiciously weighted. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Holland</ENAMEX> has expunged much of the melodrama
that marked the war-horse dramatization The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heiress</ENAMEX> (made into a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1949</TIMEX>
film with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Olivia de Havilland</ENAMEX>, directed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Wyler</ENAMEX>), and has even
corrected a problem that irked <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publication</ENAMEX>, when he reread
his early novel and declined to revise it for reprinting: that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Morris Townsend</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Catherine</ENAMEX>'s fortune-hunting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">suitor</ENAMEX>, was too much of a one-dimensional lout.

            
But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Heiress</ENAMEX> , for all its un-Jamesian
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> and thunder, remains the truer adaptation. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Holland</ENAMEX>'s tone is detached to
the point of having no discernible point of view. She seems to have confused
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James</ENAMEX>' irony with distance--when, in truth, few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> in history have
achieved such pitiless and devastating intimacy. For the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two-thirds</NUMEX> of
the film, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Holland</ENAMEX> barely even lingers on her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heroine</ENAMEX>'s features. This remote,
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">objective Washington Square</ENAMEX> carries little wattage.

            Under the
novel's sometimes placid surface is a tug of war, which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wyler</ENAMEX> made palpable but
which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Holland</ENAMEX> must think will dramatize itself. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">James</ENAMEX>' trademark
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">innocents</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Catherine</ENAMEX> is acted upon by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> titanic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX>: her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>, Dr.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sloper</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albert Finney</ENAMEX>), whose express desire to protect a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> he considers
ugly and witless takes the form of ruthless repression; her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aunt</ENAMEX>, (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maggie</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX>), who wishes to weave out of her niece's life a breathlessly melodramatic
romance; and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Morris Townsend</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ben Chaplin</ENAMEX>), the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">playboy</ENAMEX> who has squandered a
modest inheritance and now seeks salvation in the form of this unloved,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">unlovely</ENAMEX>, and affluent young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>. Each of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> comes with the
trappings of civilization and high society, but it is the natural, untutored
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Catherine</ENAMEX> who proves the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">superior</ENAMEX>--if, ultimately, woebegone--<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Holland</ENAMEX>'s one innovation is in her handling of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Townsend</ENAMEX>.
The scene in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sloper</ENAMEX> pays a visit to the young <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">suitor</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX>--to pry
from her a confirmation of his suspicions about her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX>--no
longer climaxes with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>'s expulsive warning to keep <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Catherine</ENAMEX> from
marrying him. There are still plenty of reasons to think <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Townsend</ENAMEX> would be a
less-than-exemplary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>, but fewer to think he'd be a monstrous <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>.
Indeed, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chaplin</ENAMEX> never signals the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>'s duplicity, and one wonders if his
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Townsend</ENAMEX> has even fully admitted to himself that his motives are impure. He
might love <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Catherine</ENAMEX> for her money, but at least he could love her,
whereas her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>, clearly, could not. The performance is complex, shaded,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">irreducible</ENAMEX>--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jamesian</ENAMEX>. And <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chaplin</ENAMEX> makes a marvelous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX>'s
vivaciously silly Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Penniman</ENAMEX>, all shiny-eyed with vicarious pleasure and
perfumed by her own cheap romanticism. ("You'll have to excuse me, Mr.
Townsend," she tells the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lovers</ENAMEX> she's supposed to be chaperoning, as she flits
to the door. "I have the most fortuitous headache.")

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Finney</ENAMEX> plays <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sloper</ENAMEX> as a
sour and grave <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> in whom all feeling has been deadened since his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> died
giving birth to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Catherine</ENAMEX>. He is clearly the villain of the piece, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who
deprives his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> of happiness not simply because he believes Townsend
intends to, but because he feels that unhappiness is her due. It might be,
however, that his contempt is too much on the surface, so that his bitterly
conclusive outburst to his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> on a mountaintop in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Switzerland</ENAMEX> feels less
than earthshaking. There is so little intimacy between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Catherine</ENAMEX>'s life-changing realization that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sloper</ENAMEX> despises her is old news.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leigh</ENAMEX> does
keep something up her sleeve, however. Upon hearing the contents of her
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>'s sadistic will, she lets out a musical laugh that is probably the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">purest</ENAMEX> note she has sounded on-screen. It was reported that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leigh</ENAMEX>'s own <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vic Morrow</ENAMEX>, inexplicably slighted her in his will, and you can't hear that
sound in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Washington Square</ENAMEX> without knowing in your bones where it came
from. It's the sound of genuine catharsis, of poison being expelled into the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">air</ENAMEX>, of bottomless anguish and joyous liberation.

            
If <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Washington Square</ENAMEX> is underripe,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">U-Turn</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Devil</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Advocate</ENAMEX> are rotting. The former is noir <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camp</ENAMEX>,
another <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>- and amphetamine-soaked foray into <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oliver Stone</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>, full of
pixilated brutality and meaningless montage (fractured zooms, black-and-white
scudding clouds, close-ups of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carrion</ENAMEX> and stuffed mountain <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">lions</ENAMEX>). Like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nicolas</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cage</ENAMEX> in the more sedate <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Red Rock West</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sean Penn</ENAMEX> stumbles into a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of
desert <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">predators</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> lull <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> leggily into the fires of hell, not so
much out of guile as instinct. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stone</ENAMEX> doesn't have a political ax to grind this
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> out, and he lets the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actors</ENAMEX> make whoopie. I don't know whom I adored more:
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Billy Bob Thornton</ENAMEX> as a greasy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hick</ENAMEX> with a whiff of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Tales From the</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Crypt</ENAMEX> -style demonism; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nick Nolte</ENAMEX>, as a skeletal, gravel-voiced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">albino</ENAMEX> who
could be <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Huston</ENAMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a decade</TIMEX> of being eaten by <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worms</ENAMEX>; or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jon Voight</ENAMEX>, as
a blind <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> whose portentous utterances are both full of crap and
eerily abstruse. I do know that I could see every plot turn dragging its limp,
maggoty carcass across the desert from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">miles</NUMEX> away. The only surprise about
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">U-Turn</ENAMEX> is the good reviews it got from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who should know better. It
is not a surprise, either, that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Al Pacino</ENAMEX> chews the scenery in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Devil</ENAMEX>'s
Advocate . And the idea that if the devil showed up on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX> he'd be running
a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> corporate-law <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX> is also, to say the least, pre-chewed. But there
are scenery chewers and there are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michelin</ENAMEX>-gourmet scenery chewers, and Pacino
has a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-star <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">feast</ENAMEX>. Waxy, lean, and lupine in his black <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Zegna</ENAMEX> suits, he
sports what appear to be false front choppers, and masticates his dumb, satanic
monologues with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shavian</ENAMEX> relish.

            
               "It seems you've already
departed." <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sloper</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Finney</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Catherine Sloper</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leigh</ENAMEX>) in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>
