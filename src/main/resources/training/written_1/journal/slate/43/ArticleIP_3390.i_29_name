            To hear <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Pinsky</ENAMEX> read
"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">To Earthward</ENAMEX>," click .

            I suppose
some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> will be surprised to find such a sexy, delicately doom-laden poem
by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Frost</ENAMEX> as "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">To Earthward</ENAMEX>." In fact, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frost</ENAMEX> is a powerfully erotic
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX>, from early poems like "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Mowing</ENAMEX>" and on through the disturbances of "The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hill Wife</ENAMEX>." The sensuality of "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">To Earthward</ENAMEX>" is acted out by its reaching,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lingering</ENAMEX>, abrupt, or stretched sentences as they tease and cavort with rhyme
and line ending. The poem is the best lesson I know in what a line of verse is:
Read it aloud, letting your voice continue past the line ending, when that is
what the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">syntax</ENAMEX> wants to do.

            
               --<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Pinsky</ENAMEX>
            

            Love at the lips was
touchAs sweet as I could bear;And once that seemed too much;I lived on air

            That crossed me from sweet
thingsThe flow of--was it muskFrom hidden <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">grapevine</ENAMEX> springsDown hill at
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dusk</ENAMEX>?

            I had the swirl and ache
From <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sprays</ENAMEX> of honeysuckleThat when they're gathered shakeDew on the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">knuckle</ENAMEX>.

            I craved strong <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sweets</ENAMEX>,
but thoseSeemed strong when I was young;The petal of the roseIt was that
stung.

            Now no joy but lacks
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">saltThat</ENAMEX> is not dashed with painAnd weariness and fault;I crave the stain

            Of tears, the aftermarkOf
almost too much love, The sweet of bitter barkAnd burning clove.

            When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stiff</ENAMEX> and sore and
scarredI take away my handFrom leaning on it hardIn <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">grass</ENAMEX> and sand,

            The hurt is
not enough.I long for weight and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">strengthTo</ENAMEX> feel the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">earth</ENAMEX> as roughTo all my
length.
