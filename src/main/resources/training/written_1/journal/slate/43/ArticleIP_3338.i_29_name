            May bad
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> see bad omens everywhere,

            The screech
of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">owl</ENAMEX>, the sight of a pregnant <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX>,

            Or a grey
she-wolf running across a field,

            Or maybe a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fox</ENAMEX> that's lately dropped her litter;

             

            Or may they
see a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">serpent</ENAMEX> like an arrow

            Slither
obliquely across, scaring the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX>.

            My prayers
will make good omens for good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>.

            I'll look
to the east and call upon the raven

             

            To sing
good fortune to come to those I fear for,

            Before he
has a chance to fly to the west,

            To the
standing pools, to prophesy bad weather.

            Wherever it
is your heart desires to go,

             

            Go safely
there and be happy, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Galatea</ENAMEX>,

            Remembering
with pleasure how we were.

            Let no
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sinister magpie</ENAMEX> say you nay

            Nor any
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">wandering crow</ENAMEX> forbid your journey.

             

            But you can
see the tumult in the sky

            When angry
Orion <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">sets</ENAMEX>. You know how black

            The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adriatic</ENAMEX> can be, and what can go wrong

            Even when
lapyx the favoring West Wind blows.

             

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> rather
may our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enemies</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wives</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>

            Experience
the unexpected gales

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Wind</ENAMEX> brings upon them, the roaring of

            The
blackening <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX>, the sound of the pounding surf

             

            Shaking the
beaches. Thus it was for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europa</ENAMEX>,

            Entrusting
the safety of her snow-white body

            To the not
to be trusted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bull</ENAMEX> when in the very

            Moment of
her departure she was aghast

             

            At the
midnight sea swarming with terrible monsters.

            She who had
only a moment before that been

            A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pupil</ENAMEX> of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> of the fields

            And a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">weaver</ENAMEX> of the garlands of the nymphs,

             

            Now all she
saw in the blackness of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the night</TIMEX>

            Were the
waves of the sea and the faint light of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stars</ENAMEX>.

            At last she
found herself upon the shore

            Of the
mighty <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundred</NUMEX>-citied island of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crete</ENAMEX>

             

            And cried
out to her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>, "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Father</ENAMEX>, I,

            Who left
behind my name and daughterly duty,

            What
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">madness</ENAMEX> was it that came over me?

            Where am I
now? Where is it I have come from?

             

            One death
alone is too little for such as I--

            Am I in my
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">senses</ENAMEX>, deploring the deed I did?--

            Or didn't I
do it? Was it some empty phantom

            That flew
up through the ivory gate of lies?--

             

            Which was
it better to do? To do as I did,

            To fly here
through the darkness over the waves--

            Or stay
back there in the field, gathering <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>?--

            If that
young <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bull</ENAMEX> were here before me now

             

            I'd strike
into its hide with avenging steel

            And break
the horns I lately hung with <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>.

            Shameless I
left the gods of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>.

            Shameless I
wait for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Orcus</ENAMEX> to take me away.

             

            If there
are any gods who listen to me,

            While still
my beauty remains, send me, naked,

            Out among
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lions</ENAMEX>, let me be eaten by tigers,

            Before
these fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cheeks wither</ENAMEX>." "Vilest <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europa</ENAMEX>,"

             

            The voice
of her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> says from far away,

            "Why do you
put off dying? There is a tree,

            An
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ash</ENAMEX>-tree, near, to hand yourself upon

            With the
silken sash you luckily brought with you.

             

            Unless,
that is, the jagged rocks that lie

            At the
bottom of yonder cliff would please you better,

            If that is
so, just give yourself to the wind,

            A royal
princess otherwise fated to be

             

            A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">slave</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">handmaiden</ENAMEX> to some savage <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">queen</ENAMEX>."

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Europa</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">wept</ENAMEX>. Quite suddenly, there stood <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Venus</ENAMEX>,

            Heartlessly
laughing and laughing, and with her her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX>,

            With his
bow unstrung, and when <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Venus</ENAMEX> had laughed enough

             

            She aid,
"<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dry</ENAMEX> up your tears and quell your rage

            When the
bull presents its horns for you to break.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Europa</ENAMEX>, you
are the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bride</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Jupiter</ENAMEX>.

            Learn how
to bear your great good fortune, for

             

            A <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> of
the world is named for you."
