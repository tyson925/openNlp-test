            In this cunning, amusing
poem, with its punch line that never wears out, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Constantine</ENAMEX>
Cavafy penetrates deep into the nature of political life. The atmosphere of
civic pride and civic hypocrisy, the mingled air of awe and contempt toward
governmental <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX>, rings not the bell of clich√© but many eerie
tintinnabulations: the gongs and chimes of public life, the distinct sounds of
what we say, what we know we mean and what we don't know we mean.

            What are we waiting for,
assembled in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">forum</ENAMEX>?

               The barbarians are due
here <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>.

            Why isn't anything going on
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">senate</ENAMEX>?Why are the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senators</ENAMEX> sitting there without legislating?

               Because the barbarians are
coming <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>.   What's the point of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senators</ENAMEX> making laws now?   Once the
barbarians are here, they'll do the legislating.

            Why did our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emperor</ENAMEX> get up so
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early</TIMEX>,and why is he sitting enthroned at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>'s main gate,in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, wearing
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crown</ENAMEX>?

               Because the barbarians are
coming <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>   and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emperor</ENAMEX>'s waiting to receive their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX>.   He's even
got a scroll to give him,   loaded with titles, with imposing names.

            Why have our <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> consuls and
praetors come out todaywearing their embroidered, their <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">scarlet togas</ENAMEX>?Why have
they put on bracelets with so many amethysts,rings sparkling with magnificent
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">emeralds</ENAMEX>?Why are they carrying their elegant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">canesbeautifully</ENAMEX> worked in silver
and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX>?

               Because the barbarians are
coming <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>   and things like that dazzle the barbarians.

            Why don't our distinguished
orators turn up as usualto make their speeches, say what they have to say?

               Because the barbarians are
coming <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>   and they're bored by rhetoric and public speaking.

            Why this sudden bewilderment,
this confusion?(How serious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>'s faces have become.)Why are the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> and
squares emptying so rapidly,everyone going home lost in thought?

               Because night has fallen
and the barbarians haven't come.   And some of our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> just in from the border
say   There are no barbarians any longer.

            Now what's going to happen to
us without the barbarians?These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> were a kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solution</ENAMEX>.
