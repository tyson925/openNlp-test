            By <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the last few</TIMEX> times we
saw her it was clearThat things were different. When you tried to help herGet
out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> or get from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> to the doorOr across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX> house
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hall</ENAMEX> to the elevatorThere was a new sense of heavinessOr of inertia in the
body. It wasn'tThat she was less willing to be helped to walkBut that the
walking itself had become less willing.Maybe the stupid demogorgon
blindRecalcitrance of body, resentful of the lawsOf mind and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spirit</ENAMEX>, was
getting its own back now,Or maybe a new and subtle, alien,<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelligence</ENAMEX> of body
was obedient nowTo other laws: "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Weight</ENAMEX> is the measure of The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> with which a
body is drawn downward To the center of the earth"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">; "Inertia</ENAMEX> isThe tendency of
a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> to resist Proceeding to its fate in any wayOther than that determined
for itself."

            That <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</TIMEX>, at the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bromells</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX>, after She had been carried up through the rational
structureBy articulate stages, floor after flashing floor,And after we helped
her get across the hall,And get across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> to a chair, somehowWe got her
seated in a chair that was placedA little too far away from the nearest
table,At the edge of the abyss, and there she sat,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Exposed</ENAMEX>, her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> the object
of our attention--The heaviness of it, the helpless graceless leg,The thick
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stocking</ENAMEX>, the leg brace, the medical shoe.

            At work between herself
and us there wasA new principle of social awkwardnessAnd skillfulness required
of each of us.Our tones of voice in this easy conversationWere instruments of
marvelous finesse,Measuring and maintaining with exactitude"The fact or
condition of the differenceThere was between us, both in space and time."Her
smiling made her look as if she hadJust then tasted something delicious, the
charmHer courtesy attributed to her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>.

            This decent elegant fellow
human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">beingWas</ENAMEX> seated in virtue, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX>, disability,Behind her the order of
the ranged bookshelves,The windows monitored by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Venetian</ENAMEX> blinds--"These can be
raised or lowered; numerous slats,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Horizontally</ENAMEX> arranged, and parallel,Which can
be tilted so as to admitPrecisely the desired light or air."

            We were all
her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maggie</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anne</ENAMEX>,And I, and the nice <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX> Brahmin
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elderly manNamed</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Duncan</ENAMEX>, utterly friendly and benign.And of course it wasn't
whether or not the worldWas benign but whether it looked at her too much.She
wasn't 'painfully shy' but just the same I wouldn't be surprised if there had
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">beenPainfulness</ENAMEX> in her shyness earlier on,Say at dancing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>. Like others,
though, she hadSurvived her childhood somehow. Nor do I meanShe was unhappy.
Maybe more or less soBefore her marriage. One had the sense of tripsArranged,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">committees</ENAMEX>, concerts, baffled courage

            Living it through, giving
it order and style.And <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> had the sense of the late marriage as ofTwo
bafflements inventing the sense they made Together. The marriage seemed, to the
outside world,And probably was, radiant and triumphant,And I think that one
could almost certainly sayThat during the last, heroic, phase of things,After
his death, and after the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX>, she hadBy force of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> and careful
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>,Maintained a certain degree of happiness.

            The books there on the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bookshelves</ENAMEX> told their stories,<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Line</ENAMEX> after line, all of them evenly spaced,And
spaces between the words. You could fall through the spaces.In one of the books
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX> told the story:"In the scale of being, wherever it begins,Or ends,
there are chasms infinitely deep;Infinite vacuities ... For surely,Nothing can
so disturb the passions, or Perplex the intellects of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> so much,As the
disruption of this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">union</ENAMEX> withVisible nature, separation from allThat has
delighted or engaged him, a changeNot only of the place but of the mannerOf his
being, an entrance into a state Not simply which he knows not, but perhapsA
state he has not faculties to know."

            The dinner was delicious,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">fresh greens</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">reds</ENAMEX>,And <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">yellows</ENAMEX>, produce of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the season</TIMEX> due,And <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> from the
nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">sea</ENAMEX>; and there were alsoAshes to be eaten, and dirt to drink.
