            To start with an image of
the tragic,what would have beenthis <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">poem</ENAMEX>'s end--if this morningI hadn't eaten a
roll with jam I might havesaid, finally, the nightdid what night always does,
it swallowedmy <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>, their <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX> slung around each other's waists,after I
drove off chasing my highbeams.Outside their shingled walls & roof
<ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">earlierand</ENAMEX> surrounded by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pinewoodsthat</TIMEX> evening my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> & I had been
saying goodbyewhen one of them--the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>--surprised by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX>-seat suddenly
visiblein the back of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> (lit up by an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">interior lightas</ENAMEX> I opened the
door)--he said, my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeez</ENAMEX>, they (meaning <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michaela</ENAMEX> & our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Simone</ENAMEX>),they won't be able to go anywhere.Seeing I was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">as far as 150 miles</NUMEX> from
homewith the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>, & my beinga potential traffic fatality,or worse (deadbeat
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dad</ENAMEX>, abandoner), he was right.I saw myself a moment as indispensable, happy to
be needed, much likea canoe-paddling guide or gondola <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilot</ENAMEX>.But my other
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">friend</ENAMEX>--the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>--squinting at the baby-seatwith pity & amusement, she
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">saidFor christ</ENAMEX>'s sake, you might as well wear a chastity belt.And somehowthe
mention of sex dragged death behind it--I meannow that I have settled(with
responsibilities)my dates with this or that sexual tsunami should bea thing of
the past,right?So there I was--caught between being one <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> or another,
neither.Really, none of this is tragic.Can I be loved enough, that's my
story.

            --for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark & Jill</ENAMEX>
