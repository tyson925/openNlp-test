            What the new, monstrously
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">budgeted Godzilla</ENAMEX> brings <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> is that size doesn't matter--that
tacky crudeness harnessed to a real vision can have more brute power than all
the state-of-the-art computer wizardry that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX>'s money can buy. This
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>, the title titan is a devil-visaged <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lizard</ENAMEX> who convincingly wrecks
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manhattan</ENAMEX>; lays a load of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX> that hatch velociraptor-like little (i.e.,
<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">9-foot</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dinosaurs</ENAMEX>; and gets nailed on his way to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brooklyn</ENAMEX> by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">coalition</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">military</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> secret service (don't ask). The movie,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">directed</ENAMEX> and co-written by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roland Emmerich</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Teutonic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">schlockmeister</ENAMEX> who
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">awed</ENAMEX> (or stupefied) the world with <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Independence Day</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>), isn't
entirely <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lame</ENAMEX>. The way the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">beast</ENAMEX> is finally snared has a certain architectural
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">piquancy</ENAMEX>. And sequences of the great lizard winding among skyscrapers as if
they're <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">hedges</ENAMEX> in a lawn <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">maze</ENAMEX>--his tail sheering off floors as it whips around
corners--have been engineered with bravura. Otherwise, size really is about all
that this tedious, underpopulated beanbag of an epic has going for it. Its
brain remains disproportionately teensy.

            It's no
big news that in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> Godzilla (or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gojira</ENAMEX> ), the creature
(played by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> in a rubber suit stomping around a miniature <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX>) was a
metaphor for the A-bombs that leveled <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hiroshima</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nagasaki</ENAMEX>. Even in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> edit, with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Raymond Burr</ENAMEX> tacked on as a portentous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX>, the aura
of mourning was palpable. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Godzilla</ENAMEX> is the only cheesy disaster flick
that feels as if it was made by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who'd actually lived through some kind
of horrific devastation. And even after countless sequels of escalating
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">silliness</ENAMEX>--in which the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">monster</ENAMEX> became <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">savior</ENAMEX>, battling other mutant
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reptiles</ENAMEX> and space <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aliens</ENAMEX> and rescuing <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> who'd call out (in
laughably dubbed <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>): "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Thanks, Godzilla</ENAMEX>! Come back soon!"--Godzilla
retained a nuclear-haunted nobility.

            I'm not just endorsing retro-chic when I say that the guy
in the rubber suit is more fun. For my money, he's also scarier. I don't
want an anatomically correct <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Godzilla</ENAMEX>. The original <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Godzilla</ENAMEX> is a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dragon</ENAMEX> , a mythical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">destroyer</ENAMEX> who's close in spirit to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> legend
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golem</ENAMEX>--the colossal, indestructible <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">clay</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> summoned up out of all the
dark <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> of this world who can't be destroyed by any of this world's
weapons. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Godzilla</ENAMEX> who lumbers through a metropolis on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> legs, erect,
slowly crushing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> and knocking over <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>, robotically training his
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">radioactive</ENAMEX> breath on anything and everything he sees, is a mythical vision of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Armageddon</ENAMEX>.

            The new,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">down-to-earth Godzilla</ENAMEX> is much closer to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">tyrannosaurus</ENAMEX> of Jurassic
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Park</ENAMEX> and to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">giant</ENAMEX>-monster pictures such as <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Beast From</ENAMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fathoms</ENAMEX> . He's almost never erect--he stoops to incinerate. He's
supposed to be smart. He can out-swim torpedoes and dodge heat-seeking missiles
(which take out the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler Building</ENAMEX>, among other man-made wonders). And just
when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> say, "Whew! I think I lost him!" he pops out from some cunning
hiding place and gobbles them down. So why does he still strike me as a less
than formidable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponent</ENAMEX>? Well, any forefather (and, given his reproductive
capacities, foremother) of a new <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> that chooses to travel halfway around
the globe to lay his <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX> in the middle of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manhattan</ENAMEX> doesn't seem built to
survive, evolutionarily speaking.

            
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Emmerich</ENAMEX> cribs his basic suspense techniques
(the low-angle camera riding in on open-mouthed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spectators</ENAMEX>) from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spielberg</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaws</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jurassic Park</ENAMEX> , his egg imagery from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alien</ENAMEX> , his
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">marauding baby dinosaurs</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gremlins</ENAMEX> , and a scene of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Army</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">striding</ENAMEX> through some <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">South Seas</ENAMEX> devastation from <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Apocalypse Now</ENAMEX> . What's
uniquely his own is the way the havoc periodically grinds to a halt to make
room for "relationship" scenes, in which the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> maintain a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">soap</ENAMEX>-opera
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">obliviousness</ENAMEX> to everything (crumbling <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">skyscrapers</ENAMEX>, fire-breathing <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">beasts</ENAMEX>) but
their feelings .

            Oh yes, there are human
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX>, sort of. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matthew Broderick</ENAMEX>, that charmingly worried wise <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX>, plays
an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX> in radioactive genetic mutations. He stays heroically credible even
as the film grows insanely incredible, as when he has to pretend to outrun the
rampaging <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>-story <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Godzilla</ENAMEX> for half the length of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manhattan</ENAMEX> island in a tiny
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">yellow</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cab</ENAMEX>. The other performances are as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">crude</ENAMEX> as the writing, although <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hank</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Azaria</ENAMEX> brings terrific bonhomie to the part of a daredevil TV cameraman, and
the brilliant <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harry Shearer</ENAMEX> doesn't entirely disgrace himself as a pompous
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">anchorman</ENAMEX>. As a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Broderick</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX>, the spiky, forward redhead Vicki
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewis</ENAMEX> could have walked off with the picture if she hadn't been brushed aside
in favor of a dumb blond aspiring TV <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX>, played by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maria Pitillo</ENAMEX>--a
sitcom <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actress</ENAMEX> who can't utter a line without the left side of her mouth
curling up in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valley</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Girl</ENAMEX> incredulity or down in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Valley</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Girl petulance</ENAMEX>.
Contrary to what you might have read (or awaited hopefully), <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mayor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ebert</ENAMEX> and
his contentious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aide</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Siskel</ENAMEX>, do not get squashed.

            Which brings me to another
well-known <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critic</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aristotle</ENAMEX>, who, at the dawn of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Western</ENAMEX> drama, deemed
spectacle the medium's least important component. It's true that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cinema</ENAMEX> is a
less cerebral form, and that much of what <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aristotle</ENAMEX> considered a thrilling
night out would make us commit suicide out of boredom. But if, as a filmmaker,
you're going to make spectacle the top priority, you'd better show us stuff
we've never seen before. You'd better keep those miracles coming, or we're apt
to grow nostalgic rather quickly for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the days</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">spaceships</ENAMEX> on wires and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">monsters</ENAMEX> in rubber suits.
