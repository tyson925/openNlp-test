            Is there anything less
cinematic than a lengthy swatch of voice-over prose recited straight from the
pages of a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">75-year-old</TIMEX> novel with the camera yoked to an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actress</ENAMEX>'s face? Well,
actually, yes, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about a million</NUMEX> things (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> chases, ocean liners taking on
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">water</ENAMEX>) when the words are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Virginia Woolf's</ENAMEX> and the face is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vanessa Redgrave</ENAMEX>'s.
In <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the last half-hour</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marleen Gorris</ENAMEX>' film of Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dalloway</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Woolf</ENAMEX>'s
rhapsodic prose and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Redgrave</ENAMEX>'s radiant countenance combine for some of the most
transcendentally beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cinema</ENAMEX> I have ever seen.

            Before I
go nuts with the superlatives, let me add that the previous hour of Mrs.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dalloway</ENAMEX> is pretty spotty. The novel, published in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1925</TIMEX>, stands
shoulder-high to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Woolf</ENAMEX>'s next book, To the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Lighthouse</ENAMEX> --which is to say,
to one of the dozen greatest novels written after <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">I.</ENAMEX> It's almost
entirely interior, set behind the eyes of a handful of upper-crust <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Londoners</ENAMEX>,
with point of view slipped like a baton from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> to the next. How do
you adapt it for a medium as surface-oriented as the movies? The book is so
<ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">musical</ENAMEX> in its ebb and flow that it might lend itself best to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX> opera,
consisting entirely of interwoven solos--monodramas seen and heard by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX>, no one else.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gorris</ENAMEX>--who is <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX>, and whose previous works include the
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">rabid A Question of Silence</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1983</TIMEX>) and the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Oscar-</ENAMEX>winning <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Antonia</ENAMEX>'s
Line (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>)--doesn't get all the notes right, but at least she gets that
there ought to be notes: that the work is fundamentally musical, and that the
music shivers with nostalgia.

            For much
of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the first hour</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Redgrave</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clarissa Dalloway</ENAMEX> drifts around a sunny,
<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">post-World War I</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX>, talking excitedly of a party to take place at her home
that <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</TIMEX>, exchanging formal pleasantries with various aristocrats, and
moving in and out of her memories. We move with her, back before the war, as
the young <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarissa</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Natascha McElhone</ENAMEX>) lazes elegantly on a vast estate,
romping with her saucy (and politically progressive) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sally Seton</ENAMEX> (Lena
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Headey</ENAMEX>) and putting up with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Walsh</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Cox</ENAMEX>), a misanthropic but palpably
smitten <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">suitor</ENAMEX>. Then she meets the bland, proper <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Dalloway</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Robert</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Portal</ENAMEX>) and, in choosing to marry him, goes where she has been bred to go--and
where she will be safest. The very title of the work is tinged with regret,
since its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">protagonist</ENAMEX> is presented to us not as lighthearted <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarissa</ENAMEX> but as
the older <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dalloway</ENAMEX>'s somewhat shrinking, sickly missus. (It's odd that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorris</ENAMEX>,
whose other films are so flagrantly--even homicidally--feminist, should put so
much more emphasis on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clarissa</ENAMEX>'s rejection of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter</ENAMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Woolf</ENAMEX> gives equal, if
not stronger, weight to her inchoate romantic feelings for the vivacious
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sally</ENAMEX>.)

            
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Woolf</ENAMEX> provides a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">nightmarish</ENAMEX> echo to Mrs.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dalloway</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Septimus Warren Smith</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rupert Graves</ENAMEX>), an ex-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldier</ENAMEX> who has had
the misfortune of witnessing a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buddy</ENAMEX> being blown to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">bits</NUMEX> in front of his eyes.
He now slips in and out of lucidity before his despairing, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX>-born <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rezia</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amelia Bullmore</ENAMEX>); like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarissa</ENAMEX>, he is haunted by the lack of permanence
in all things. Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dalloway</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Septimus</ENAMEX> never meet, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorris</ENAMEX> brings them in
sight of each other at the start of the film; and news of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Septimus</ENAMEX>' fate
triggers Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dalloway</ENAMEX>'s tortured and then euphoric final musings--the epiphany
that brings the movie to its poetic conclusion.

            Until
then, the doings have been awfully prosy. Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dalloway</ENAMEX>'s flashbacks are of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Masterpiece Theatre</ENAMEX> variety when they ought to have been less objective,
more impressionistic, even if such doodling had come at the expense of a
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">full</TIMEX>-bore narrative thrust. (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Woolf</ENAMEX> herself is always losing the pulse of the
narrative--which is perhaps the whole point.) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eileen Atkins</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">English</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actress</ENAMEX> who adapted Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dalloway</ENAMEX> as a labor (or labour) of love, has
done almost too smooth a job of translating its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX>'
stream-of-consciousness perceptions into speakable dialogue. Better, I think,
to have left some bleeding fragments. If ever a project called for a
combination <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer-director</ENAMEX>--a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> who would confidently leave things
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">unwritten</ENAMEX>, secure in the knowledge that he or she would, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX>, fill it
all in--it's Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dalloway</ENAMEX> .

            As <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gorris</ENAMEX> weaves together past and present, often moving
back and forth several times in a single scene, she aims for a melting
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fluidity</ENAMEX>. But her images refuse to melt. Her pass-the-baton shifts in point of
view come off as fancy but not especially resonant. When the camera lingers on
Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dalloway</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elizabeth</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Katie Carr</ENAMEX>), as she sits on the top of a
double-decker bus, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX>'s face is blank and the moment empty of meaning.
Why have we followed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elizabeth</ENAMEX> onto this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bus</ENAMEX>? (I half expected it to flatten
some poor <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Tolstoyesque</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peasant</ENAMEX>.) It turns out that we stay with her so she can
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gaze</ENAMEX>, in passing, at an apartment <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>--so that the camera can travel up to
and through a window and come upon <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Septimus</ENAMEX> supine on a sofa,
contemplating--what? Read the book to learn what he's thinking and feeling,
because all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gorris</ENAMEX> gives us is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> grimacing on a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couch</ENAMEX> and a lot of distant
explosions to signal his flashbacks.

            It is
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Graves</ENAMEX> who suffers most from the lack of imagination. The traumatized,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">flashback-ridden</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">veteran</ENAMEX> was a novel figure when Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dalloway</ENAMEX> was
written--and something of a mascot for the postwar modernist literature that
followed. Now, after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX> of watching sweaty <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vietnam</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vets</ENAMEX> sitting bolt
upright in bed after acid-soaked nightmares of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buddies</ENAMEX> getting
disemboweled, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">moviegoers</ENAMEX> regard such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> as so much Freudian chin music.
In the book, what goes through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Septimus</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> retains its power to startle--not
so much for what he remembers as for how his remembrances color the present and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pierce</ENAMEX> its surface like an X-ray. The movie's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Septimus</ENAMEX> never seems more than a
literary conceit, and only in his fleeting moments of sanity does <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Graves</ENAMEX>
acquire a mordant poignancy.

            
It should be said that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Redgrave</ENAMEX>, in addition to
being too old for Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dalloway</ENAMEX>, is too tall (she looms over her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>) and
too forceful. All of which means, of course, diddly squat. It barely matters
that the book's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> have been aged from their <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">40s</NUMEX> to their <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">60s</NUMEX> to
accommodate her, because what else do you do when you have a shot at casting
the greatest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actress</ENAMEX> in the world? Even silent, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Redgrave</ENAMEX> is plangent, a
quivering string. Pity the poor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actress</ENAMEX> who has to embody her earlier self.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McElhone</ENAMEX> is a handsome young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> with the demeanor of an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Irish</ENAMEX> milkmaid--not
so much unformed as opaque. There's a thin line between period acting and
overacting, and more than once <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McElhone</ENAMEX> drifts over it.

            With the
exception of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bullmore</ENAMEX>'s ghastly <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rezia</ENAMEX> (her accent is pathetic), the rest of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actors</ENAMEX> are treasurable: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Kitchen</ENAMEX> as old <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Walsh</ENAMEX>, who melds so
perfectly with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Cox</ENAMEX>, the young <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walsh</ENAMEX>, that I wondered if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gorris</ENAMEX> had got
hold of a time <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">machine</ENAMEX> and used the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actor</ENAMEX> twice; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Selina Cadell</ENAMEX>'s
rough-hewed missionary <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Miss Kilman</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sarah Badel</ENAMEX>'s stout and effulgent <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lady</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rosseter</ENAMEX> (the aged <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sally Seton</ENAMEX>); <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oliver Ford Davies</ENAMEX>' lockjawed twit <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hugh</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whitbread</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Standing</ENAMEX>'s anxiously settled older <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dalloway</ENAMEX>; and the lyrically
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">foolish Lady Bruton</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Margaret Tyzack</ENAMEX>, full of liberal schemes for helping the
unemployed by shipping them off to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>.

            But it is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Redgrave</ENAMEX> to whom we return. In the last
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">half-hour</TIMEX>, at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX>, we are finally allowed to hear Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dalloway</ENAMEX>'s
thoughts. (Why couldn't there have been voice-overs all along?) As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Redgrave</ENAMEX>
moves from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>--worrying about what each is really thinking, and
about the young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> whose tragic fate she heard tell of from one of her
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guests</ENAMEX>--the movie floods with feeling. As potent as one of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beethoven</ENAMEX>'s last
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">string</ENAMEX> quartets, Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dalloway</ENAMEX> becomes a heartbreaking meditation on the
evanescence of all things. And like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarissa</ENAMEX> herself, I didn't want the party
to end. I'll see the film again for the last sequence alone: anything to stare
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">at Redgrave</ENAMEX>'s face once more, to hear her say, "You want to say to each moment:
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">'Stay</ENAMEX>. Stay. Stay.' "
