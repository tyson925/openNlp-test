            Cemeteries are not for the
dead, but for the living. From the lonely <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">widower</ENAMEX> who makes a weekly pilgrimage
to the grave site to the sequined, sideburned <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fanatics</ENAMEX> at their annual
Graceland vigil, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> find comfort in the physical space of cemeteries,
which, with their rolling <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">lawns</ENAMEX> and rows of stone slabs, offer a tangible
connection to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">souls</ENAMEX> departed. But now that the virtual seems tangible and
connections are high-speed, can it be long before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Information Age</ENAMEX> mourners
start mouse-clicking to their dearly departed?

            Virtual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cemeteries</ENAMEX> are already here. They are neither
simply funeral businesses
that happen to have created home pages nor online tributes to traditional cemeteries--though those exist, too. Rather, virtual
cemeteries are part of a network of funeral-related <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> that set up pages for
the deceased, allowing bereaved <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Websurfers</ENAMEX> to pay their respects without the
schlep over to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Shady Acres</ENAMEX>. Like real cemeteries, most sites charge (starting
at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $10</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX>) to set up a virtual plot, which typically includes a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">photo</ENAMEX>, a bio, and reminiscences about the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>. Most also let you limit
access to those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> who know a private password. So you end up
paying more if you don't want anyone to see it--a bid for privacy on the
increasingly well-traveled Internet.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Net</ENAMEX>,
after all, seems like the last place to fashion an intimate, solemn space, but
that intimacy is what even the open-to-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">the</NUMEX>-public Web sites are after. Virtual
plots are more than a quick alternative to the graveside visit or a way to
introduce your dead <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> to the rest of the world. They're a hotlink to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">heaven</ENAMEX>, complete with interactive features: For example, some offer you the
ability to post messages to your dearly deceased. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Cemetery Gate</ENAMEX>,
"a peaceful, serene place where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> come to remember their loved ones,"
hopes that "when you leave this place, you will be refreshed, have a new vigor
and be resolute in your desire to live your life with full measure." Some sites
encourage you to send <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>--virtual ones: Send in your order, and a bouquet will
appear on the screen in your beloved's honor. And when you visit a site on
DeathNET, you can choose from a selection of somber background
music "[t]o enhance your experience."

            That their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patrons</ENAMEX> seem oblivious to outside Web traffic is
what makes the pages seem especially creepy. In contrast to the frenetic,
animated antics of most commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX>, many virtual cemeteries front
themselves with a phone-booklike alphabetical directory of names framed by a
willow <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> or a sunset. Click on a name, and (chances are) you will encounter
messages addressed directly to a dead <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>, often remarkably
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conversational</ENAMEX>--recounting the details of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">funeral</ENAMEX>, apologizing for trivial
things, or providing updates on mutual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>. You feel as if you are
eavesdropping on some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">strangers</ENAMEX>' e-mail <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> rather than witnessing a wake.
Odd, considering that cybermourners surely must know that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Web</ENAMEX> attracts
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voyeurs</ENAMEX> like a rib roast does flies.

            Yet these
sites seem focused on higher purposes, like supernatural communication. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">People</ENAMEX>
are especially unabashed about reaching out to dead <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pets</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Virtual Pet Cemetery</ENAMEX>,
which invites you to "immortalize your beloved pet in the tombs of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">cyber-</ENAMEX>space
for eternity," is filled with don't-know-what-you've-got-till-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">its</NUMEX>-gone
testaments to furry critters of the past. Grieving for a certain "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spanky</ENAMEX>," one
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Websurfer</ENAMEX> writes:

            Oh I
remember the telephone cords you used to eat, The funny way that you walked (so
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ungraceful</ENAMEX> and un-feline-like), That blank stare, so void and yet so
characteristic of you, Would touch upon my heart as you meowed.

            
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Virtual</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Memorial Garden</ENAMEX> (which doesn't charge to post a memorial) predicts that
virtual cemeteries will revolutionize our relationships with the dead. "Perhaps
you will see cyberpyramids and datasphinxes appearing. Certainly there will be
electronic crypts as pages devoted to whole <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> are assembled." There is
already quite a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> of the deceased developing on the Web. Many sites
cordon off special areas for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> of drunken driving, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX>, or war. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Wide</ENAMEX>
Cemetery also sorts out those who committed suicide or donated organs.
Inmemoria even
features a "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pantheon</ENAMEX>." Virtual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cemeteries</ENAMEX> seem eager to play the role of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Information Age</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX>--providing an atmosphere of community support;
promoting private, spiritual reflection; and assuring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immortality</ENAMEX> to
boot.
            

            In the
end, the Internet turns out to be a great resting place. Dead <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> don't seem
any more dead than anyone else in cyberspace, where everyone we connect
with is disembodied. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anonymous</ENAMEX>, infinite in its variety, and located somewhere
that appears both real and yet not quite of this world, cyberspace is not too
different from the places we imagine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> go when they die. And with its easy
access and defiance of time and space, it is the perfect place for us to visit
them.
