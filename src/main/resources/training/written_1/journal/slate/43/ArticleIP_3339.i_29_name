            Don't look now (I said
don't look !)

            I'll tell
you when you can look), just lie back

            as if we were--well, as
if

            we were
talking . Try to behave

            as if we were by
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ourselves,</ENAMEX>

            that's why I
brought you here in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> place.

            The trouble with these
rooftop

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">refuges</ENAMEX>--the
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> place in Tangier

            you can see a touch of
green,

            something
alive besides <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and camels--

            the trouble is, there's
always

            a roof
higher than the one you're on,

            a man
looking down, watching ...

            Why bother getting really

            comfortable
if someone's ... In 
               any 
               case
            

            I'd never dream of
dragging

            my best
Bokhara out here--this old

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ardabil</ENAMEX> is lovely still,

            they never
lose their ... The colors are fixed

            by making the camels piss

            all over
them, then washing them out

            in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canal</ENAMEX>: harsh
treatment,

            you'd think,
but it works--look at me !

            All the suppler for the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX>

            I've been
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">manhandled</ENAMEX>, you must admit ...

            
               Now
look: you see what I mean?

            That's a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> up there,
standing

            where he can
... No, not Mustapha! Someone

            he's put there to spy
on us.

            On
me ! What does it matter to him
            

            whether I'm up here with
you

            or one of
the bath-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>? He has to

            
               know , that's all, it
affords him

            some kind of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gratification</ENAMEX> (more

            than he gets from
anything

            he ever does
with me!) ... Try some of this,

            she put the rose-petals
in

            just this
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX>, it tastes really fresh ...

            Oh! now I
see: that ... person
            

            is nothing like
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mustapha</ENAMEX>'s

            usual
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">parasites</ENAMEX>. One thing I do have

            is a good memory for

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX>. You must have noticed him:

            a sharp-faced foreign
devil

            always
lurking somewhere and staring so?

            He takes it all in as if

            life were
the scene of the crime , even

            the pair of us ,
harmless enough

            on these
irreproachable hassocks. Look!

            I know he's the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>,
crouching

            with a
notebook in his artful hands:

            
               he's
put us in his picture!
            

            As far as art goes--and
art

            such as his
goes far enough for spying:

            you don't suppose
Mustapha

            sold rights
to the roof?--we incarnate

            your typical <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Tangerine</ENAMEX>

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dalliance</ENAMEX>.
Can't you just hear the giddy

            little screams once he
returns

            to his
studio: "My dear, how

            positively classical !"
...

            Never mind,
he's leaving now. Some more

            fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">loukoum</ENAMEX> ? The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tea</ENAMEX>'s still warm,

            and so am <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">I. Do</ENAMEX> just as
you like.
