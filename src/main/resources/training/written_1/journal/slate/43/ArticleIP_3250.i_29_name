            It was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">only a decade</TIMEX> ago
that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen McCauley</ENAMEX> published his <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> novel, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Object</ENAMEX> 
               of My
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Affection</ENAMEX> , and startled his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> by having his gay <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">protagonist</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George</ENAMEX>,
move in with a flaky <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brooklyn</ENAMEX> social <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nina</ENAMEX>, and agree to be a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> to
her unborn <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>. It wasn't that either of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> plot strands (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the end of</TIMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George</ENAMEX>'s affair with a self-absorbed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> and start of another with a
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Vermont</ENAMEX> ex-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hippie</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nina</ENAMEX>'s decision not to marry the blowhard <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> of her
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">baby</ENAMEX>) broke new ground, only that the mixture raised modern and entertaining
questions: Why would this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> feel more comfortable raising a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> with a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homosexual man</ENAMEX> than with a heterosexual one? Could <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> who love each
other but aren't in love with each other stay together under such
sexless circumstances? Could the gay <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> convert--and, if so, would the
conversion take ? <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McCauley</ENAMEX>'s writing is mild and rather shapeless, but he
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gropes</ENAMEX> honestly for some new design for living. He wins the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> over as much
for what he doesn't do--take cheap shots at his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX>--as for the breadth
of his observations. The book is gratifyingly unslick.

            The film
that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nicholas Hytner</ENAMEX> has directed (from a screenplay by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">playwright</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wendy</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wasserstein</ENAMEX>) is slick, sweet, and disastrously unmoving--even <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who live
to cry at the movies will find themselves depressingly dry-eyed. Hytner, an
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Englishman</ENAMEX> who made his name in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">theater</ENAMEX> (his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX> revival of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carousel</ENAMEX> at
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lincoln Center</ENAMEX> had real weight and scope), hasn't figured out how to create
intimacy with his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> on-screen or how to direct his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actors</ENAMEX> so they
expose themselves in the myriad microscopic ways stage <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actors</ENAMEX> can't. Hytner
doesn't overhype his images or call attention to his own directorial hand, as
he did in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Madness</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Crucible</ENAMEX>
(<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>). But the film is just as stagy and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX>'s-length. It's anyone's guess
what The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Object</ENAMEX> is supposed to be about.

            A big part of the problem is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jennifer Aniston</ENAMEX>, who plays
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nina</ENAMEX> as if her confusion is a consequence less of so many modern splintered
paradigms than of plain simple-mindedness. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aniston</ENAMEX> can pout, and let her eyes
crinkle up in fatuous happiness, and look moistly maternal. But that's about
it. When she tells <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Rudd</ENAMEX>, directed to be dear) that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> of
her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> isn't "home" to her, that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George</ENAMEX> is "home," and that they need to
throw out the old ways and invent some new ones, the scene has no urgency; she
could be talking about where to go for dinner. She isn't a phony--she doesn't
risk enough to be phony. Actresses get attention for their hair when they don't
draw you in with their features. To demonstrate their growing closeness, Hytner
leads the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> through jazzy swing-dance montages, along with scenes in which
they hit each other with pillows (a common cinematic sign of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX>'s
closeness but not necessarily accurate; as an experiment, I hit my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> with a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pillow</ENAMEX>, and she threw me out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>).

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> I respect were reduced
to puddles by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wasserstein</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Heidi Chronicles</ENAMEX> , although I found it a
collection of stereotypes. Still, her stereotypes (in that play) brood
engagingly over whether their behavior is too stereotypical. For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Object</ENAMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">My Affection</ENAMEX> , she has invented an entirely new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cast</ENAMEX> of supporting
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX>, but they add little that anyone other than a development executive
could think this story needs. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Allison Janney</ENAMEX> plays <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nina</ENAMEX>'s stepsister, whose
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Alda</ENAMEX>) is described, glibly, as the "most powerful literary agent
in the world." These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> are intended as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foil</ENAMEX> for the nonjudgmental main
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX>--the sort of fake <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">liberals</ENAMEX> who proclaim tolerance out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> side of
their mouths and issue snobbish put-downs of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gays</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brooklyn</ENAMEX> out of
the other. Someone could write a monograph on the role of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brooklyn</ENAMEX> in movies:
It would surely include this one, which ends with a liberal-utopian vision of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">biracial</ENAMEX>, bisexual unity in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Park Slope</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wasserstein</ENAMEX> also brings in a weary,
aging <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critic</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nigel</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hawthorne</ENAMEX>) who can echo <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nina</ENAMEX>'s plight, watching the object
of his own affection drift into the arms of a younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> and delivering
elegant monologues on the subject.

            Elegant monologues don't help
an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> bond with a movie, however. Compare <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Object of My</ENAMEX>
Affection with that grisly sitcom tearjerker As <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Good as It Gets</ENAMEX> , in
which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James L. Brooks</ENAMEX> manages to generate an emotionally compelling movie out
of a situation that has nothing-- nada --to do with any reality I know of.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brooks</ENAMEX> doesn't worry much about composing a frame or giving you a sense of
place; he came from television, made it big with a TV-style tearjerker
( Terms of 
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Endearment</ENAMEX> ), and knows how to pull you in whether you
want to be pulled in or not. Detached ironists such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hytner</ENAMEX> might pride
themselves on not stooping as low, but sometimes it's the stoopers whom you
want to take home for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the night</TIMEX>.
