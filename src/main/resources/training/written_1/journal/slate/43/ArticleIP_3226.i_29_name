            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harrison Ford</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX>?
It sounds like an idea whose time has come. For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last few years</TIMEX>--let's be
honest about it, ever since <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> got elected--<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX> has exiled our
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fearless</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> to a kind of movie hell. In The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> he
was a shy, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lonely widower</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Independence</ENAMEX> Day his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> went down in a
helicopter and he got upstaged by the more manly <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Will Smith</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Absolute</ENAMEX>
Power he was a real lemon--a lecherous sadist and an accomplice to murder.
But at long last, in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX> One the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> gets to be something
other than a loser or a scoundrel. He's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Marshall</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Vietnam War</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hero</ENAMEX> and
a stand-up <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX>. Even rarer <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these days</TIMEX>, his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> (played by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wendy Crewson</ENAMEX>) is
actually alive, and he's still in love with her. The only problem is that he's
come to power at the dawn of a confusing new era, when globalization is
blurring national boundaries and the world is more vulnerable than ever before
to random, heavily accented terrorist <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">villains</ENAMEX>.

            Thank God
our reigning action <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hero</ENAMEX> is at the helm--or so you'd think. Actually, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Force One</ENAMEX> takes <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">less than five minutes</TIMEX> to demonstrate the drawbacks of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harrison Ford</ENAMEX> as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> of the free world. It opens in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moscow</ENAMEX>, where
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marshall</ENAMEX> delivers a major speech explaining why he authorized
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> to capture <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Radek</ENAMEX>, the tyrannical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kazakhstan</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Radek</ENAMEX> is dangerous and evil, he says, and although he presents no immediate
threat to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> interests, it's high time for us to abandon such piddling,
hypocritical concerns as the national interest. Out with wimpy measures like
economic sanctions--it's time to become uncompromising moral <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enforcers</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marshall</ENAMEX> warns <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX> around the world that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">from now</TIMEX> on, "It's your turn to
be afraid." This is a depressing, scary, reckless announcement, and as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX>
delivers it you think how disturbing it would be to have someone like him as
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>. For all his popularity, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> has built his career on an
inarticulate, uncomfortable, and somewhat angry persona. What's saved him from
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">grimness</ENAMEX> is his status as an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">outsider</ENAMEX>, his flippant sense of humor, and his
lovable grin. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Han Solo</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Indiana Jones</ENAMEX> were a long time ago, and lately
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX>'s been cultivating a look of unrelieved pain.

            Playing a powerful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> figure, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> looks as miserable
and hunted as he did in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">The Fugitive</ENAMEX> , and that's exactly the point.
Following his speech the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> boards <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force One</ENAMEX> to return <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">home</ENAMEX>, and for
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five minutes</TIMEX>, in a scene so idyllic it borders on the bizarre, he's able to let
down his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guard</ENAMEX> and relax in the bosom of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>. He kisses his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>. Their
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX>, adorable little <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alice</ENAMEX>, announces that she'd like to visit a refugee
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">camp</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minister</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poor</ENAMEX>, helpless wounded <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daddy</ENAMEX> worries that she's
not old enough, but Mommy laughs tenderly and says, "She couldn't stay your
little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> forever, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim</ENAMEX>." This dialogue has the eerie earnestness of a
testimonial in an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX> commercial, along with a dig at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinton</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">James</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marshall</ENAMEX> isn't a good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> because he feels our pain. He's a good
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> because he feels his pain--the pain of steering the world
through this chaotic period of realignment, when all he really wants to do is
help his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> with her homework and smooch with his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>.

            It's
Global <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Village</ENAMEX> meets <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Family Values</ENAMEX>, and once this slick high concept is
established, the action can begin. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gary Oldman</ENAMEX> leads <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dastardly followers</ENAMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Radek</ENAMEX> in posing as a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">film crew</ENAMEX>, and a flirtatious moron of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aide</ENAMEX> lets them on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX>. There, assisted by a turncoat <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
official, they quickly take control of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>. Oldman, barking out the
hysterical howls that serve as lingua franca for all cinema <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX>, calls
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> and tells <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kathryn Bennett</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glenn Close</ENAMEX>) that
he'll kill <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hostage</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">every half hour</TIMEX> until <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Radek</ENAMEX> is released. Meanwhile the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> has gone missing. Everyone assumes he's left the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> in an "escape
pod" and is floating safely to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">earth</ENAMEX>; only the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> knows that he's stuck
around--<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> and foremost to rescue his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX>, and then, if it's
convenient, to save the world.

            
What follows is one of the more joyless joy
rides in recent memory. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolfgang Petersen</ENAMEX>, made his mark with
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Das Boot</ENAMEX> , a masterfully absorbing thriller set on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> a claustrophobic
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX>. You'd think <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Petersen</ENAMEX> would have fun staging an airborne
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">showdown</ENAMEX>, but there's not a scene in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force One</ENAMEX> that wasn't done <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
times better in the underrated <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kurt Russell</ENAMEX> hijacked-airplane thriller,
Executive Decision . That movie had the good sense to leave its absurd
politics (<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chechen</ENAMEX>, then <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Middle Eastern</ENAMEX>) on the margins, and to focus
instead on the scary ordeal of being stuck on a plane piloted by crazies. With
geeky charm, it patiently explored the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX>'s engineering; it literally walked
you down into the underbelly, a beautiful abstract maze of crisscrossing
steel.

            
               Air
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Force One</ENAMEX> rips off <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> the adventures from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Executive</ENAMEX>
Decision --there's a blatantly similar scene involving the cutting of
wires--but the suspense never builds. A number of scenes actually revolve
around the astoundingly dull theme of cellular communication. Here are two
typical "action" sequences: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> needs to get word to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>
that he's still alive and hiding on board the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX>. He desperately rummages
through some luggage. He finds someone's cell phone and calls the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> hatches a plan to help the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hostages</ENAMEX> escape, but he needs to
alert the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX> to his scheme. This time it's harder, because he's lost the
cell phone and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX> have shut down the regular phones, but a
presidential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aide</ENAMEX> reminds him that faxes go out on an auxiliary line. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Solemnly,</ENAMEX>
she leads him over to the fax <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX>, where he scribbles out a message and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dials</ENAMEX>. Will the fax go through? <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tension</ENAMEX> mounts. After <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a few moments</TIMEX>, we hear
the telltale squeak of a successful transmission, accompanied by triumphal
music.

            Such scenes do not a nail-biter make. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harrison Ford</ENAMEX> tries
to help by looking anguished as he hits, kicks, and shoots his way to the final
duel with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oldman</ENAMEX>. But again, the relentless search for with-it political
relevance slows the film down. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oldman</ENAMEX> is supposed to represent reactionary
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russians</ENAMEX> enraged by the new economic reforms. "I'm doink it for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Muzzer Russia</ENAMEX>,"
he drawls, and "I veel not rest unteel zee <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">capitalists</ENAMEX> are dragged through the
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets und</ENAMEX> shot." The rhetoric may be modern, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> is a cartoon
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">anachronism</ENAMEX>, right down to his corny, drawn-out delivery, which clocks in at
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about five</NUMEX> words per minute. And his cause seems so pathetically weak compared
to the raging progress of capitalism around the world that watching him strut
is like watching someone shoot a gun you know is filled with blanks.

            There's not a single thing
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force One</ENAMEX> to recommend, except perhaps the controlled
performance of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glenn Close</ENAMEX>, who does remarkably well as the recipient of
several phone calls from the sky. But there is something strangely comforting
about how bad this movie is. For a while there, all those stories about
weak-willed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">presidents</ENAMEX> were worrisome. It was hard not to see them as tapping
in to a deep-seated nationwide gloom. After <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force One</ENAMEX> , though, we
should be able to breathe easier. It is just too boring to reflect our actual
fantasy life, and so brazenly concerned with exploiting the Zeitgeist
that it makes you wonder if it isn't <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX> that's shrouded in gloom, while
the rest of us are getting along fine.
