            All he had to know was
that the railswent one way and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">highway</ENAMEX> went anotherand that there was a
separate logic, somethinghe didn't have to understand; the lakesanyhow kept him
busy and straining to hearthe <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> in front of him. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Motors</ENAMEX>,he tried
to explain, destroyed the beds, but theywere only interested in the foliage.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">thinghe</ENAMEX> learned about the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Swiss</ENAMEX>, they ate all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">morningand</ENAMEX> talked without a
letup, and they likedour lakes as much as theirs. Sometimes the railsfollowed
the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice-versa</ENAMEX>, horsesversus <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX>; where he sat the sunshone behind
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>, he caught the trunksand most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branches</ENAMEX>; he was at peace
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">becausehe</ENAMEX> could hate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporations</ENAMEX> and stilladore the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">leaves</ENAMEX>; he learned to
do that in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX>,studying <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Frick</ENAMEX> then walking through the woodsand loving
the hills and looking down, nothinggave him greater pleasure, finding a
marblehoof, for example, or a sea shell, in someremote <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>, or in
a factorygiven over to profit to see a doorknobmade, as it were, in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crete</ENAMEX>, or
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>. He crushedhis <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">cup</NUMEX> in the netting as they moved overwater, "he was at
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sea</ENAMEX>," he said to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Swissand</ENAMEX> he explained how "money talked" just as
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">theyclimbed</ENAMEX> through another woods. He was hopinga small leaf would stick to the
window, somethingred, with a pear to match, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bartlett</ENAMEX>; pearsand <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">apples</ENAMEX> made
him sleep. There was one bridgediagonally under another, they were flyinginto
and through each other; there were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> leaves,<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> on top of the other and it
was raining.
