            I recently heard that there
are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pornography sites</ENAMEX> on the Web. Sex is one of the few things people
are consistently willing to pay for online (sports and stocks are among the
others), and there are obvious reasons for this--say, privacy and convenience.
You may be able to find the same stuff as what's online at any decently stocked
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">porn</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop</ENAMEX>, but to do so you have to go to that neighborhood, physically enter
that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX>, and then worry about what the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clerk</ENAMEX> thinks of your interest in
dominant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">transvestites</ENAMEX>. Browsing at home, it's just you and your modem, and
using the mouse only takes one hand.

            The
recently launched "literate smut" <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Webzine Nerve</ENAMEX> might be Sex Site No. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,001</NUMEX>, but don't call it
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">porno</ENAMEX>. In a letter to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX>, the site's twentysomething <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> declare,
"<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nerve</ENAMEX> intends to be more graphic, forthright, and topical than
'erotica,' but less blockheadedly masculine than 'pornography.' " If
pornography encompasses all those hot 'n' hunky sites out there, and erotica is
that safe and boring <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">territory</ENAMEX> of romance novels and scented candles, then
Nerve wants it both ways: rough sex and soft lighting, meaningful talk
and meaningless orgasm.

            You wonder why no one has ever tried this before. Go to
Yahoo! and type in "literature & sex," and you get sites such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madeline</ENAMEX>'s Sex Offerings,
which contains articles such as "Some
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philosophical Thoughts</ENAMEX> on Giving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Head</ENAMEX>," by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madeline</ENAMEX> herself. And this is
the high end. More typical are sites such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pussy Vision</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blow Job</ENAMEX> of the
Day. Search for "erotica" (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of matches) and get sites such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yellow</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Silk</ENAMEX>, the online version of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berkeley</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journal</ENAMEX> the Utne
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reader</ENAMEX> called a "tasteful celebration of the sensuality of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX> life."
Or the Web site of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Anne</ENAMEX>
Mohanraj, whose most recent book, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Torn Shapes of Desire</ENAMEX> , is touted
as "eminently literary, well-written and tasteful" (there's that word
again).

            The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Nerve</ENAMEX> feel no need to be tasteful, God bless 'em. What you
find here are actual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> holding forth on subjects near and dear to their
hearts, and other organs; writing that generally seems to know the difference
between the precious and the precise. And they do it without sacrificing lust
and the promise of sexual possibility. As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ruth Shalit</ENAMEX> says in her review of
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> books about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">predator</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Candace Bushnel</ENAMEX>'s Sex and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">City</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anka Radakovich</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sexplorations</ENAMEX> ), "When staging a literary revolution,
it never hurts to be sans-culottes ."

            
In its architecture, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nerve</ENAMEX> is not
especially revolutionary: There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> distinct sections within the site,
each with its <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">de rigueur icon</TIMEX> in the margin. In "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Smut Cut</ENAMEX>," the reviews
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">section</ENAMEX>, you will find pieces like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shalit's</ENAMEX>; "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Roles</ENAMEX>" features essays on sex,
gender, and relationships; "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Pedantry</ENAMEX>" presents pieces by public figures such as
former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Surgeon General Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joycelyn Elders</ENAMEX> on favorite <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> (take a guess);
"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Ex Libris</ENAMEX>" comprises "favorite erotic passages from our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>";
"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Skin</ENAMEX>" is photos of flesh; "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Threads</ENAMEX>" is occasionally interactive erotic
fiction; and "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Bar</ENAMEX>" is a yet-to-be-launched chat area. Nerve wants to
provide something for everybody: there's homeless sex, prison sex--there's even
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norman Mailer</ENAMEX>, who says in a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17-year-old</TIMEX> interview (published here
simply because it's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mailer</ENAMEX>) that he draws the line at <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> porn. (Everyone has
his limits.) Though the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Advertisements for Myself</ENAMEX> has always
liked his sex the way a schoolboy likes his <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pie</ENAMEX>--any way he can get it--he was
never the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">hippest cat</ENAMEX> in the pack (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witness</ENAMEX> "The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White Negro</ENAMEX>," his attempt to
grapple with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beats</ENAMEX>, which proved the adage that those who had to ask what
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hip</ENAMEX> was, weren't). In the interview, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mailer</ENAMEX> recalls reading a line from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">William</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S. Burroughs</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1959</TIMEX> that flat out cleaned his clock: "I see God in my asshole
in the flashbulb of orgasm."

            "I
remember reading it and thinking, I can't believe I just read those words,"
recalls <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mailer</ENAMEX>. "I can't tell you the number of taboos it violated. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First of</ENAMEX>
all, you weren't supposed to connect God with sex. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX> of all, you never
spoke of the asshole, certainly not in relation to sex. If you did, you were
the lowest form of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pervert</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX> of all, there was obvious homosexuality in
the remark. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">those days</TIMEX> nobody was accustomed to seeing that in print. And
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX>, there was an ugly technological edge--why'd he have to bring in
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">flashbulbs?</ENAMEX>"

            While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nerve</ENAMEX> hasn't violated many taboos yet, the
site does betray some expectations. "Skin," the photography area, is doubtless
heavily trafficked. The pictures are quick to download-- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nerve</ENAMEX> is very
user friendly: good navigation, great design, and an intelligent use of icons.
Some images, like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Kern</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Girls</ENAMEX> , are as soft-porn as a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Playboy</ENAMEX> calendar. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greg</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Friedler</ENAMEX>'s black-and-white photos from his book <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Naked New York</ENAMEX> are
slightly disturbing: <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">New Yorkers</ENAMEX> (who answered an ad in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Village</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Voice</ENAMEX> ) are photographed twice--clothed and naked--and the pictures
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">juxtaposed</ENAMEX> side by side, before-and-after fashion. Their change of expression
(or lack thereof) is itself a comment on the meaning of nakedness--many appear
more defensive unclothed, as if to counteract any vulnerability--and the effect
is almost anti-erotic.

            Equally
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">un</ENAMEX>-arousing are <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barbara Nitke</ENAMEX>'s pictures from the sets of porno films,
where she worked as a still <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">photographer</ENAMEX>. There is a sad, Felliniesque quality
to these images: bored and exhausted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> lying on a king-size bed, surrounded
by dildos of towering dimensions; an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actress</ENAMEX> being eaten out while the director
casually talks to her about the scene. "Once I got focused on their underlying
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sadness</ENAMEX>," says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nitke</ENAMEX> of her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>, "it was all I would see for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>."

            
So far, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nerve</ENAMEX> has avoided most
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sentimental</ENAMEX>, you-gotta-have-heart reminders that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> need more than just
sex. The attitude seems more carnivorous and unapologetic: We need sex, let's
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">indulge</ENAMEX>, and save talk about those other important things for <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Nightline</ENAMEX> .
True, there are lapses. Fiona
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giles</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> of a book called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dick</ENAMEX> for a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Day: What Would You Do If You</ENAMEX>
Had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX>? (surprise! most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> would have sex with themselves), has a
moment of sadness when, having gone dickless for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX>, she finds herself
"walking down the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>, thinking I should ask someone for a hug." <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barbara</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nitke</ENAMEX> also recalls a porn <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">star</ENAMEX> saying all he wanted was a hug. (The moral:
Whether getting laid consistently or not, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> need hugs.) For the most part,
though, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nerve</ENAMEX> is a hug-free zone.

            It will be interesting to
see if <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nerve</ENAMEX> can keep it up. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> seem to know good writing when
they see it: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Novelist John Hawkes</ENAMEX> makes an unexpected appearance with a new
introduction to <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Passion Artist</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Poppy Z.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brite</ENAMEX> has a touching fantasy of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Lennon</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul McCartney</ENAMEX> holding
more than each other's hands. (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Co-editor of Nerve Genevieve Field</ENAMEX> was
executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTV Books</ENAMEX>--words that, linked together, look about as
strange to my eyes as "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">God</ENAMEX>" and "asshole" did to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norman Mailer</ENAMEX>'s.) "Piss
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christ</ENAMEX>" <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">creator</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andres Serrano</ENAMEX> is to be featured in "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Skin</ENAMEX>" soon, so we know
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesse Helms</ENAMEX> will be bookmarking this page. And if the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> are ever tempted
to take themselves too seriously, they can always refer to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lisa</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carver</ENAMEX>'s hilarious essay on the differences between "sensualists" and
"sexualists"--those who like talking about it and those who like doing it.
"<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sensualists</ENAMEX> have sex without orgasm on purpose," she writes of all those
candle-loving, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX>-bearing himbos. "They call it tantric sex. I'd call it
a bad date."
