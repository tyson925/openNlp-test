            You said you had lunch in
Pittsfield, was it on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North Street</ENAMEX>?That reminds me of when we lived on the
farm.It must be eighty <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX>.We went to a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-room <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school house</ENAMEX>, didn't you
drive past it once?Each row was a different grade.I sat in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> seat of
the first row.The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX>'s name was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miss Brown</ENAMEX>.She was so pretty.I wonder if
she's still alive.<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">The day</TIMEX> before we left the farm our <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> disappeared.We
couldn't find her anywhere.I was sad for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX>.<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Three months later</TIMEX> she showed up
at our new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pittsfield</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Robbins Avenue</ENAMEX>.I can't think of the number
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">now</TIMEX>.My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> was in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>.She didn't like the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> she was living with so
she'd visit us.She fell in love with the young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who lived next
door.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maurice</ENAMEX>.Your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">uncle</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maurice</ENAMEX>.They got married and moved to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cleveland</ENAMEX>.They're
both gone now, aren't they?You know, I can't picture her.<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A few years later</TIMEX> we
moved to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>.This just jumped into my mind: I must have been <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three years</TIMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">old</ENAMEX>.We were still in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mir</ENAMEX>.A small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, but famous for its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yeshiva</ENAMEX>.My
oldest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX>--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe</ENAMEX>--took our horses down to the river.They were the two best
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>.My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> had a phaeton.A beautiful old buggy.He was like a
taxi <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">driver</ENAMEX>, he took <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Minsk</ENAMEX>.Or Vilna.<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">That day</TIMEX> he was at the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">station</ENAMEX>.The passenger <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">station</ENAMEX>, waiting for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX>.My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> was still just
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX>.He must have been washing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX> in the river.I can remember--it was
a hot day.Maybe he was giving them a drink.And while I was watching the reins
got caught around a pole in the river.The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX> kept twisting the reins around
that pole.It was slippery, the reins kept sliding down under the water and they
were pulling the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX> down with them.I ran into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> and got my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> who
came running back with a knife in his teeth.He jumped into the river with all
his clothes on.He took the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">knife</ENAMEX> and sawed away at the reins until he finally
cut through.He saved the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX>.I haven't thought about this in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a thousand</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>.It's like a dream: you get up it's forgotten.Then it all comes
back.Didn't I ever tell you?Look at me, I'm starting to cry.What's there to cry
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about</TIMEX>?Such an old, old memory, why should it make me cry?

            I'm writing
a poem about you.

             

            
               You are? What's it
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about</TIMEX>?
            

             

            It's the
story about your childhood, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX> in the river.

             

            
               The ones that nearly
drowned? ... I saved them.
            

             

            You told it
to me just <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few weeks ago</TIMEX>.

             

            
               I should dig up more of
my memories.
            

             

            I wish you
would.

             

            
               Like when I lived on the
farm and one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> fell down the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">well</ENAMEX>?
            

             

            Yes.

             

            
               I forget if it was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rose</ENAMEX>
or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pauline</ENAMEX>--it was a deep well.
            

             

            I remember
that story.

             

            
               Have you finished your
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">poem</ENAMEX>?
            

             

            I'm still
working on it.

             

            
               You mean you're
correcting it, with commas and semicolons?
            

             

            
Exactly.

             

            
               When can I see
it?
            

             

            As soon as
it's finished.

             

            
               Is it an epic?
            

             

            It's not
that long.

             

            
               No, I mean all my
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">thoughts</ENAMEX>, the flashes of what's going through my life, the whole family history
... living through the woe, the river and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>.
            

             

            I know.

             

            
               Will it be
published?
            

             

            I have to
finish it first.

             

            
               It's better to write
about real life, that's more important than writing something fanciful.
            

             

            I try to
write all my poems about real life.

             

            
               You see, the apple never
falls far from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>.
            

             

            I guess
not.

             

            
               You're my <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">apple</ENAMEX>.
            

             

            There's
probably a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worm</ENAMEX> crawling through that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">apple</ENAMEX>.

             

            
               Then it's got something
sweet to chew on.
            

             

            Well,
you're my <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>.

             

            
               Yes,
I'm your <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>--you're an apple, I'm a <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>.
