            He could have smacked
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">youfor</ENAMEX> running out of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX>, at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midnight</TIMEX>,in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December</TIMEX>, at a middle-of-nowhere
place,coasting a few sorry <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">yards</ENAMEX> toward home on the shoulderas a passing
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eighteen</NUMEX>-wheeler's <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hawaiian</ENAMEX>-sized wave of airwhomped the side of the car like a
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-story pillow.As we sat there immobile--the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> of us (including him),as if
waiting for the show to begin at a surreal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drive-in</ENAMEX>--he wanted to reach into
the front seatand bonk your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heads</ENAMEX> togetherthe way the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> of the Three
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stooges</ENAMEX> didwhen the other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> did something stupid.What had been road was now a
cold placewithout a house light in sight in the rural <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South.What</ENAMEX> had been a
passionate highway talkabout the culture's indifference to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX>'s
workwould have been silence except for himgiggling at us, at how danger
dissolves discontentand flashes before us a life lost to pettiness,which we
soon start to lose again."Who said there are no neurotics in wartime?"he
planned to mock us with my voice, but when I got outto see where we were, he
didn't. He brooded in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>.He didn't feel the pleasure of a skyful of
starsso cold and clear when you look upits light illuminates your breath.Nor
was he worried about anyone but himself,being the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> with nothing to
worry about,not made of flesh. He was cryingI wanna go home inside the carlike
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> trapped in a junked refrigerator.

            This was one
time I felt exactly like him,as we three stood pondering our dilemma calmly,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">maturely</ENAMEX>.And I did again when he yelled I'm scaredas the clunker with wide
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">headlights</ENAMEX> and bad muffler(<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">"Hell Wagon" or "Devil's Dream</ENAMEX>" no doubt inscribed
on the fender--voted <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Car Of The Year</ENAMEX> by escaped convicts and serial
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">killers</ENAMEX>)glided like a crocodile toward our throbbing, imported taillightsand
idled there. But when I approached the monsteralone--my other self was having
none of this action--what I found when the window inched downwas reality: a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> with a baby asleep between them: <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country peoplewho</ENAMEX> still stop for anyone
in trouble,although they were wary. So was I,squinting into the warm darkness
in which they stirredas if to the bottom of a moonlit pool,as if what should
surface nonetheless was a gun in my face.They got back with a can of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> so
fastthe whole event took about the time of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howard Johnson</ENAMEX> hamburger,and
probably less time than a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howard Johnson</ENAMEX> hamburger off a lifein which it's
almost impossiblenot to feel blessed. How lucky we are,we said on the smooth
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> home again,trying to etch it into our brains.At least I was, since we had
ditched him back there

            thumb out
and grinning into the high beams of every approaching carbecause this one's got
to be the starlet in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguarwrapped</ENAMEX> in a mink with nothing underneath.
