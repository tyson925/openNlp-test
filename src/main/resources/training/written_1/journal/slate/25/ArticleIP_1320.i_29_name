<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Smithee Film</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Burn Hollywood Burn</ENAMEX>
                (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hollywood Pictures</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Reviewers</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pan</ENAMEX> this mock-documentary about a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Smithee</ENAMEX> who destroys the
negatives for his forthcoming film. "[A] stunningly bad, sophomorically vulgar
parody" (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Mathews</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsday</ENAMEX> ). (Intended joke: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Smithee</ENAMEX> is the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pseudonym</ENAMEX> used when a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> removes his name from a film's credits.
Unintended joke: <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Burn Hollywood Burn</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> took his name off the
credits.) Problems are said to include a glut of heavy-handed in-jokes; a
spiteful tone; and disjointed editing, done by the film's despised
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">screenwriter</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe Eszterhas</ENAMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Showgirls</ENAMEX> ). (The film is plugged here.)

                (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Touchstone Pictures</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Critics</ENAMEX> disagree on
the merits of this sendup of academia starring <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Dreyfuss</ENAMEX>. Some accuse
the film--about an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">anthropologist</ENAMEX> who fakes discovering an indigenous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tribe</ENAMEX>--of
purveying racial stereotypes. Its laughs are as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">crude</ENAMEX> as the chuckles of
"little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> sniggering over <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Geographic</ENAMEX> " (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Susan Wloszczyna</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA Today</ENAMEX> ). Others say its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">digs</ENAMEX> at ivory-tower credulousness and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dreyfuss</ENAMEX>' turn as a neurotic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> make it "too funny to ignore" (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">David</ENAMEX>
Denby, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> ). (The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trailer</ENAMEX> is available here.)

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">distributor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> weigh in on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Fatal Attraction</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adrian Lyne</ENAMEX>'s
controversial adaptation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nabokov</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1955</TIMEX> novel. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Wood</ENAMEX>, in the New
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">York Review of Books</ENAMEX> , says the film, which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stars</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeremy Irons</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Melanie</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Griffith</ENAMEX>, "is downright demure; deeply, almost debilitatingly loyal to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nabokov</ENAMEX>'s novel." The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Yorker</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anthony Lane</ENAMEX> calls it "a slight,
tender movie--not, I think, worth fighting a battle over."

of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Light</ENAMEX>
               , by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madonna</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner Bros.</ENAMEX>). The material <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> goes spiritual
with her first pop album in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four years</TIMEX>. It works. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Critics</ENAMEX> are charmed by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madonna</ENAMEX>'s newfound passion for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kabbalah</ENAMEX> and impressed by her frank treatment of
her own careerism. "A flawless, grown-up" album, says the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times of</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Jackson</ENAMEX>. Praise also goes to her integration of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">techno</ENAMEX> beats and
computer effects. The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39-year-old</TIMEX> diva thus recovers from an early-'90s
"creative nadir"-- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Erotica</ENAMEX> and Sex --that "reeked of heat-seeking
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">desperation"</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Browne</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Entertainment Weekly</ENAMEX> ). (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Audio</ENAMEX> clips are

               , by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore Vidal</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Random House</ENAMEX>). Reviews for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vidal</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX> rd novel range from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poor</ENAMEX> to lukewarm. The story is viewed
as a paltry excuse for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vidal</ENAMEX> to lash out yet again at <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> imperialism (set
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1939</TIMEX>, it is the tale of a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prep-schooler</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smithsonian</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">after-hours</ENAMEX>, when the exhibits come to life). The forays into science fiction
are said to have "the unfortunate effect of liberating all [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vidal</ENAMEX>'s] worst
artistic impulses" (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Bowman</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> ). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vidal</ENAMEX> does
win praise for caustic portrayals of dead <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">presidents</ENAMEX>--with all the "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">freaks</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">foibles</ENAMEX>"--of the sort he has brought to his other historical fiction
(<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher Benfey</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times Book Review</ENAMEX> ).

                (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Royale Theatre</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York City</ENAMEX>). As did their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">counterparts</ENAMEX>, most <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> rave over <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">playwright</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yasmina</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reza</ENAMEX>'s satire about modern art. Her comedy about an argument over the merits of
an all-white painting is "like a marriage of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moli√®re</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Woody Allen</ENAMEX>" (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jack</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kroll</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek</ENAMEX> ). Key points: the accessibility of the aesthetic debate;
the hilarious banter; and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Seinfeld</ENAMEX> -like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX>, especially that
of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">an egomaniac</NUMEX> (played by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Alda</ENAMEX>). But some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> dismiss the controversy
over white paintings as slight and old-hat: "theatrical brain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">candy</ENAMEX> but from a
gourmet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop</ENAMEX>" (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Linda Winer</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsday</ENAMEX> ).

Close" (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum of Modern Art</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York City</ENAMEX>). The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">57-year-old</TIMEX> portraitist
wins acclaim for bucking trendy postwar art movements. His billboard-size faces
are said to hearken back to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rembrandt</ENAMEX> and classical court <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX>. The critical
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">favorites are Close</ENAMEX>'s later, quasipointillist portraits, which he completed
after a blood-vessel injury paralyzed him. The power of his work is attributed
to its scale and his meticulous method. "His pictures ... are like magic
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tricks</ENAMEX>," says the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Kimmelman</ENAMEX>. (MoMA trumpets the
