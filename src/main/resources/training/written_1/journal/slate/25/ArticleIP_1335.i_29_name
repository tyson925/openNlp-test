                (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buena Vista Pictures</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lipstick lesbian Anne Heche</ENAMEX>
wins praise for her first leading role since coming out. Though some had
doubted she'd make a convincing straight <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> 's
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rita Kempley</ENAMEX> gibes that "[s]he seems to have mastered the nuances of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heterosexuality</ENAMEX>." A few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reviewers</ENAMEX> say <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heche</ENAMEX> and co-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">star</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harrison Ford</ENAMEX>, marooned
together on a tropical <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX>, lack chemistry. Others say <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">comic director</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ivan</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reitman</ENAMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Ghostbusters</ENAMEX> ), who made <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX>'s bomb <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Fathers</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Day</ENAMEX> ,
has lost his touch and is now just recycling old lines and plots.

            
               
                  The
Opposite of Sex
                (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony Pictures Classics</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Critics</ENAMEX> call rookie director
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Don Roos</ENAMEX>' romantic comedy one of the most original in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>. "A happy exception
to the rule that any movie with 'sex' in the title must be mediocre" (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Andrew</ENAMEX>
Sarris, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Observer</ENAMEX> ). A precocious <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16-year-old</TIMEX>, played by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christina Ricci</ENAMEX>--"<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lolita</ENAMEX>'s evil twin" (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Janet Maslin</ENAMEX>, the New York
Times )--runs off with her gay <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lover</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Reviewers</ENAMEX> like the
unpredictable plot twists, witty asides about sexual identity, and the casting.
Many predict stardom for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ricci</ENAMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Addams Family and The Ice</ENAMEX>
Storm ). <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dissenters</ENAMEX> fault the film for turning sentimental at the end.

revives her career playing a cult <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lesbian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">photographer</ENAMEX>. But apart from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sheedy</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">melancholic</ENAMEX> portrayal of the doped-up <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">photographer</ENAMEX>, the film is said to be
"full of itself and its artistic pretension" (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Mathews</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>
Times ) and saddled with clich√©d depictions of bohemianism. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Critics</ENAMEX> say it
uses saucy lesbian love scenes simply to attract <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewers</ENAMEX> and to make up for its
insubstantial plot.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Williams</ENAMEX> play from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1938</TIMEX> makes its <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> debut. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Critics</ENAMEX> say it offers fresh
insights into the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">playwright</ENAMEX>'s tortured mind. They're shocked by the violence
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 27-year-old</TIMEX>'s portrait of a prison revolt. "The sensitive <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Williams</ENAMEX> would
be the last <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> you would associate with this play," says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek</ENAMEX> 's
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Kroll</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Detractors</ENAMEX> call the dialogue overwrought: It "sounds like bad

Kitman, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsday</ENAMEX> ). His monologues are judged clunky and not funny, and
"his mode of interviewing consists mainly of salivating over <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guests</ENAMEX> for being

reviews for the latest from the hyperintellectual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Gold Bug</ENAMEX>
Variations . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Powers</ENAMEX> tries to shed his reputation as inaccessibly scholarly
by writing a straightforward novel about a soap <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> and an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX> who
gets <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ovarian cancer</ENAMEX>. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> praise his insight into the dark nature of
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> business and his riffs on subjects from chemotherapy to free markets.
Others say his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> just deliver long, boring speeches on esoterica. "It
hardly seems fitting ... to call it fiction" (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gail Caldwell</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX>
