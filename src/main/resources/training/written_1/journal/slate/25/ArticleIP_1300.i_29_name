                  <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Seven Years</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tibet</ENAMEX>
                (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TriStar Pictures</ENAMEX>). A general dismissal of
this docudrama by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Swiss</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jean-Jacques Annaud</ENAMEX> ( The Name of the
Rose ) about the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dalai Lama</ENAMEX>'s friendship with an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Austrian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mountaineer</ENAMEX>,
played by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brad Pitt</ENAMEX>. A "preachy history lesson," says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leah Rozen</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> . Other pans dwell on the film's sentimentalization of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tibet</ENAMEX> and
its skirting of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">protagonist</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nazism</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pitt</ENAMEX>'s performance and his efforts at
an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Austrian</ENAMEX> accent are deemed "painful at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">moments</TIMEX>" (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth Turan</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Angeles Times</ENAMEX> ). Only the "beautifully filmed" (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jay Carr</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Globe</ENAMEX> ) mountain vistas are said to make the movie worth watching. (For more
on the veracity of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Annaud</ENAMEX>'s take, see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jared Hohlt</ENAMEX>'s "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Life and Art</ENAMEX>" in

                (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Line Cinema</ENAMEX>). Raves for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Thomas Anderson</ENAMEX>'s morality tale about the rise and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fall of the '70s</TIMEX> porn
industry. A damning "indictment of the excesses" of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">era</TIMEX>, says
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsday</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Mathews</ENAMEX>. Praise goes to the film's period costumes; the
humorous script; and performances by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Burt Reynolds</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Julianne Moore</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mark</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wahlberg</ENAMEX> (formerly known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marky Mark</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Critics</ENAMEX> are especially pleased that,
for a sex film, it "stints on sex" (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Corliss</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> ). <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Dissenting,</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Denby</ENAMEX> wishes it had more insights into the porn
industry: It "doesn't really satisfy our curiosity about this ... fascinating
but wan way of life." (See <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sarah Kerr</ENAMEX>'s review in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate</ENAMEX>
and the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Boogie Nights</ENAMEX> site.)

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">house</ENAMEX>'s first new collection since the murder of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gianni Versace</ENAMEX>,
is praised for remaining true to his high-camp vision of style. "It was as if
he had created these clothes himself," says the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daily News</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Orla Healy</ENAMEX>.
Credit goes to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donatella</ENAMEX>, who took over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Versace</ENAMEX>. It was amazing "she
could produce anything at all ... with so much pressure and so much pain" (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amy</ENAMEX>
Spindler, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> ). Widespread doubts about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX>'s
financial future are said to have been assuaged.

               Internet <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Explorer 4.0</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft Corp.</ENAMEX>). Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> say <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>'s
browser upgrade gives it the upper hand in its war with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Netscape</ENAMEX>, "whose
position ... resembles [that of] the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Confederate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gettysburg</ENAMEX>"
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hiawatha Bray</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boston Globe</ENAMEX> ). Renovations include a new e-mail
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX> and modifications to Windows <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">95</TIMEX> that make the operating system more like
a Web site. Other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> predict <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>'s new bells and whistles will make
no difference to the average <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX>, who will consider the competing browsers
"more alike than different" (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce Schwartz</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA Today</ENAMEX> ). Still others
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accuse Microsoft</ENAMEX> of predatory business practices, including ripping off the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">programming language Java</ENAMEX> from its competitor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sun</ENAMEX>. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> lets you download its
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">browser</ENAMEX>. So does <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Netscape</ENAMEX>.)

               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nobel</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Prize for Literature , Dario Fo</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Critics</ENAMEX> applaud the selection of the
absurdist <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">playwright</ENAMEX>, even while calling him the "most obscure <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Nobel</ENAMEX>
winner" in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Streitfeld</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> ). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fo</ENAMEX>'s work,
especially <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Accidental Death of an Anarchist</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1970</TIMEX>), is celebrated for
combining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">trenchant</NUMEX> left-wing satire with slapstick humor "reminiscent of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vintage Marx Brothers</ENAMEX>" (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rick Lyman</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> ). Conservative
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> echo the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vatican</ENAMEX>, which condemned the choice of the anti-clericalist
and ex-Communist as an act that "has surpassed all imagination." In the Wall
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Street Journal</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Schwartz deems Fo</ENAMEX>'s plays "unwatchable for anybody
but those wanting to hear ... a recitation of the ... clich√©s of the left."

               , by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven Pinker</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Norton</ENAMEX>). In a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">660</NUMEX>-page tome, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIT</ENAMEX>
psycholinguist popularizes a controversial theory of evolutionary psychology:
that the brain is like a computer program that has been shaped by natural
selection. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Critics</ENAMEX> find the book entertaining, praising digressions on
gambling, laughing, and love, as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pinker</ENAMEX>'s pop-culture references.
"[<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX>]itty popular science that you enjoy ... for the writing as well as for the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">science</ENAMEX>," says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark Ridley</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times Book Review</ENAMEX> . But some
also use the occasion to take evolutionary psychology to task: "[<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">I</ENAMEX>]t wants to
explain too much, too easily" (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Holt</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> ).

schematic: "Large thematic strokes may define his architecture, but within lies
continual surprise at the fluidity and resilience of the human condition."
