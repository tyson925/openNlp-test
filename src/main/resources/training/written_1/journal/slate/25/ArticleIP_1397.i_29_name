<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Simpson</ENAMEX> 's civil <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jury</ENAMEX> ordered him to pay <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$25 million</NUMEX> in punitive
damages to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ron Goldman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nicole Brown Simpson</ENAMEX>, on top of
the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$8.5 million</NUMEX> in compensatory damages already awarded. The <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$25 million</NUMEX>
figure is based on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simpson</ENAMEX>'s assets and potential <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">lifetime</TIMEX> earnings, and is
designed to make sure he can't keep any money he makes from his notoriety in
the case. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> point out that the jury neglected to deduct <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simpson</ENAMEX>'s debts
in calculating his net worth, so the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> or an appeals <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> will probably
reduce the damages accordingly. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> used the occasion to
reopen the debate over excessive punitive-damage awards. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ron Goldman</ENAMEX>'s father
offered to renounce his claim for damages if <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simpson</ENAMEX> would publish a detailed
confession. (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2/12</NUMEX>)
            

            

               <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> met with congressional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> of both parties.
The meeting produced an agreement to try to agree on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> issues :
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">education</ENAMEX>, juvenile crime, family tax cuts, tax credits for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX> that
hire <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> off welfare, and experimenting with urban-renewal ideas in the
District of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Pundits</ENAMEX> were impressed by the cordial atmosphere, which
was in contrast to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX>'s. But they pointed out that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sides <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) left
out campaign-finance reform; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) blocked each other's pet initiatives (e.g., the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">balanced-budget</ENAMEX> amendment and health insurance for poor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>); and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) disagree
sharply even where they ostensibly agree (e.g., the federal role in education,

               Independent films dominated the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Academy Award</ENAMEX> nominations .
("<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Independents Day</ENAMEX>," declared both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los Angeles Times</ENAMEX> and the

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shine and Fargo</ENAMEX> got <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> apiece. Several big <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">studios</ENAMEX>
were shut out of the top categories. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Evita</ENAMEX> and its star, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madonna</ENAMEX>, got
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stiffed</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milos Forman</ENAMEX> blamed no best-picture nomination for The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> vs.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry Flynt</ENAMEX> on hostile lobbying by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">feminists</ENAMEX>. A best <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actress</ENAMEX> nomination
went to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kristin Scott Thomas</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The English Patient</ENAMEX> , which
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">20 th Century Fox</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> had dropped because they wanted Demi
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moore</ENAMEX> to play the role. Consensus spin: The nominations are a signal that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are sick of big-budget action flicks and hungry for good, well-written
stories. Consensus prediction: The big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">studios</ENAMEX> will be embarrassed for a few
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX> and then will go back to churning out mindless blockbusters.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Authorities</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Hampshire</ENAMEX> agreed to spare the life of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> that
killed a rooster . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prince</ENAMEX> was sentenced to die under a "<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> strikes"
ordinance against vicious <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Strike One</ENAMEX> was the rooster. Strikes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> and
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> were escapes from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX>. The case inspired outcries throughout the country
and was widely covered by national television and the foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX>. New
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hampshire</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX> hinted she would pardon <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prince</ENAMEX> if necessary. Eventually,

<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">fighter jets</ENAMEX> dogged passenger <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planes</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> incidents. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX> an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-16</ENAMEX>
followed a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">727</NUMEX> descending into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>--setting off the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">727</ENAMEX>'s alarms and
causing its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilot</ENAMEX> to attempt violent evasive maneuvers. Then another commercial
pilot reported that several <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-16s</ENAMEX> flew dangerously close to him. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
reports played big on television, with dark hints that top-<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">gun</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> might be
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">joyriding</ENAMEX>. But the scare was deflated by reports that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) air-traffic
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">controllers</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">727</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crew</ENAMEX> bore the blame for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> incident; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) the

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McDougal</ENAMEX> isn't corroborating the story. The juicy part of the saga is a quarrel
between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McDougals</ENAMEX>, conducted through the press, over whether she was
"intimate" with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>. She says she's too moral to have done such a thing,
and her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim McDougal</ENAMEX> is sick, bitter, and desperate to avoid <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">jail</ENAMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert H. Rubin</ENAMEX> observed that "we have had a strong

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interpreted Rubin</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delphic</ENAMEX> utterance as a sign that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> would
stop its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two-year</TIMEX> effort to push the dollar higher against other currencies. A

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">producers</ENAMEX>, but it also makes it harder for them to attract capital investment.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group of Seven</ENAMEX> industrialized <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nations</ENAMEX>, meeting in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX>, decided that the
