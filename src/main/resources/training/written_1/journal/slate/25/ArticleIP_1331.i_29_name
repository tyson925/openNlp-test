               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Frank</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sinatra</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1915-1998</TIMEX>). On his death, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Ol' Blue Eyes</ENAMEX> is pronounced "one of the
great talents of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the century</TIMEX>" (the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> ). Obits extol his
unparalleled phrasing and effortless style and glance over his unexceptional
pitch and range. They attribute his enduring popularity to his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> persona,
which coupled upper-class urbanity with working-class <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gruffness</ENAMEX> and machismo
with tenderness. All but a few whitewash his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mafia</ENAMEX> ties, brawling, silly
grudges, boozing, racism, womanizing, and the fact that "he not infrequently
resembled a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">thug</ENAMEX>" (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Rich</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> ).

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">grand</ENAMEX> finale fails to live up to its hype, and a few even pronounce it "a major
comedic disaster" (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marvin Kitman</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsday</ENAMEX> ). The episode, in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerry</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elaine</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kramer</ENAMEX> are jailed for failing to stop a car theft, is
judged as lacking the show's long-standing hallmarks: <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple subplots</ENAMEX>, tight
writing, and humor about everyday situations. Others are pleased that the show
stayed unsentimental to the last and didn't compromise itself with a sappy,
feel-good ending. Still others rejoice that the narcissistic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> finally
got their comeuppance.

<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Critics</ENAMEX> love the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>'s comic riffs but lament that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">narrator</ENAMEX>'s voice often sounds more like a middle-age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>'s than a 9-year-old
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX>'s. Others say the novel rambles: "As with a bright <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> brought down to
entertain the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guests</ENAMEX>, you begin to wonder when it will be bath time" (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard</ENAMEX>
Eder, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los Angeles Times</ENAMEX> ). They also note the new novel's fortuitous
publication date: The rumor that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monica Lewinsky</ENAMEX> bought <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX> phone-sex

punctuationless sentences and arcane language. Others praise his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cowboys</ENAMEX> for
being macho yet vulnerable. "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCarthy</ENAMEX> comes on like a bracing slap of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Aqua</ENAMEX>

(<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeff Giles</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek</ENAMEX> ), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kundera</ENAMEX> is said to overindulge in his

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">man</ENAMEX>'s anonymous love letters to his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girlfriend</ENAMEX>) is said to be trite, and the

Lehmann-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Haupt</ENAMEX> describes the book as classic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kundera</ENAMEX>--skeptical of modernity,
