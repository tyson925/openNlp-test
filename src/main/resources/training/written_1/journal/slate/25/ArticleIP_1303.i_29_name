               , by
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spice Girls</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virgin</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Critics</ENAMEX> call the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> pop <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> a triumph of
marketing over taste (their debut album sold <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 million</NUMEX> copies). Their new
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">album</ENAMEX> is deemed particularly offensive. "[B]land, half-hearted harmonizing ...
so slickly produced that most techno-pop sounds positively organic by
comparison," says the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los Angeles Times</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Natalie Nichols</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> is
said to have overplayed its fame by appearing in too many commercials.
Prediction: It will soon become a pop-history footnote. (A dissenting minority
calls the new album irresistible and compares the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Swedish</ENAMEX> band
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABBA</ENAMEX>.) ("Hi! We're the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spice Girls</ENAMEX>" is the official site. For

pointing out that the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">gallery</ENAMEX> now can exhibit oversized installations most

subjected to the horrors of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> judicial system. The plot twists are
dismissed as hackneyed, borrowed from <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Cold War</ENAMEX> thrillers and courtroom
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">melodramas</ENAMEX>. The depiction of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> life is said to be so grim that it "verges

               , by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anne Rice</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Knopf</ENAMEX>). Has the gothic horror <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> and
sometime soft-core pornographer lost her touch? Her "overwrought prose has gone
grotesquely rococo," says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Entertainment Weekly</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vanessa Friedman</ENAMEX>. This
novel, about a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">widow</ENAMEX> who finds happiness communing with ghosts, switches
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">narrators</ENAMEX> and plot lines so often that it is said to be unreadable--and
pretentious, particularly when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rice</ENAMEX> holds forth on <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catholic</ENAMEX> theology and
classical music. But some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reviewers</ENAMEX> claim to have relished the book's spirit of
kitschy fun. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Random House</ENAMEX> has a gothic page devoted to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rice</ENAMEX>.)
