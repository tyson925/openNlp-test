that contrary to assertions by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> and abortion-rights <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activists</ENAMEX>,
the vast majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who have the procedure (technically known as

Multimillionaire wrestling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enthusiast</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John E.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">du Pont</ENAMEX> was convicted of

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pont</ENAMEX> wasn't legally insane but was mentally ill--reduces his sentence from life
to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">between five and</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40 years</TIMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> part of which he will spend in a mental

               Bombs and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bomb</ENAMEX> scares dominated the news. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jacksonville</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fla.</ENAMEX>, an
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Orthodox Jew</ENAMEX> has been charged with planting a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bomb</ENAMEX> at a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Conservative</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">synagogue</ENAMEX>

few <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours later</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bomb</ENAMEX> wasn't detected, but it failed to go off. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Army</ENAMEX> of
God, a fundamentalist anti-abortion <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, has apparently claimed
responsibility for the bombings of an abortion clinic and a gay <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">nightclub</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Atlanta</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Investigators</ENAMEX> are looking into whether the bomb had something to do
with the club <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owner</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX>, a nationally known practitioner of late-term
abortions. Meanwhile, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> canceled a nationwide "terrorist threat advisory"
after discovering that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> who were thought to be assembling a huge

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>'s reported intention to certify <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> as an ally

high-level <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Supporters</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recertification</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rebollo</ENAMEX>'s arrest
demonstrated <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>'s resolve in the drug wars. But some <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> argued
that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> had failed to notify the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> of the arrest for almost two
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX>, thereby jeopardizing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">informers</ENAMEX> about whom the general

<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Scientists</ENAMEX> have cloned an adult mammal . <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Researchers</ENAMEX> who performed the

it, and that such laws couldn't be enforced anyway, since the procedure can be
done in almost any lab anywhere in the world. While <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enthusiasts</ENAMEX> point to
hypothetical benefits (e.g., saving endangered <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, replicating a dying
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">baby</ENAMEX>), media reaction has focused on ethical nightmares (e.g., breeding human
organ <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX> or supermen, replicating <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hitler</ENAMEX>, resurrecting the dead). Moreover,
"there'd be no need for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>," notes <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biologist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ursula Goodenough</ENAMEX>. A presidential

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whitewater</ENAMEX> independent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counsel</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth Starr</ENAMEX> decided not to quit after
