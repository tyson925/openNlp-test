                  Starship Troopers
                (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony Pictures</ENAMEX>). Based on a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">1950s</NUMEX> sci-fi novel,
this film about an apocalyptic war between human beings and giant bugs renews
the debate: Is <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Verhoeven</ENAMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Robocop</ENAMEX> ) a postmodern <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genius</ENAMEX> or
a purveyor of schlock? Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> bemoan <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Starship</ENAMEX> 's grotesque violence
and glorification of a "happily fascist world" (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Schickel</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> ).
Others consider it a witty sendup of action movies, with fabulous special
effects and campy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX>: "a cheerfully lobotomized, always watchable
experience" (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth Turan</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los Angeles Times</ENAMEX> ). (See the official
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Starship Troopers</ENAMEX> site.)

            
               
                  The
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Wings of the Dove</ENAMEX>
                (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Miramax Films</ENAMEX>). The latest film adaptation of a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry James</ENAMEX> novel wins praise for its fidelity to the text and its period
trappings. "The finest <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Masterpiece Theatre</ENAMEX> movie ever made," says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Owen</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gleiberman</ENAMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Entertainment Weekly</ENAMEX> ). Other plaudits go to period-piece
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">veteran Helena Bonham Carter</ENAMEX> and to the film's psychological richness. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">highbrow</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> dissent, arguing that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Iain Softley</ENAMEX> has flattened the
subtleties of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">James</ENAMEX>' novel. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Review of Books</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Louis</ENAMEX>
Menand deems the film an inferior version of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The English Patient</ENAMEX> . The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Yorker</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daphne Merkin</ENAMEX> declares <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James</ENAMEX> unfilmable. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alex Ross</ENAMEX>, writing in

                  Slate
               , disagrees. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Click</ENAMEX> here for his
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">review</ENAMEX> and here for the official site.)

            
               
                  Mad
City
                (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner Bros.</ENAMEX>). This screed against TV journalism is dismissed as
hackneyed, heavy-handed, and hypocritical. A dim laid-off security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guard</ENAMEX>,
played by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Travolta</ENAMEX>, takes <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hostages</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Museum of Natural</ENAMEX>
History, while an opportunistic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX>, played by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dustin Hoffman</ENAMEX>, eggs him
on. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Yorker</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anthony Lane</ENAMEX> says the movie imitates the medium it
critiques, "pumping up the humdrum into the histrionic." The post- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pulp</ENAMEX>
Fiction infatuation with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Travolta</ENAMEX> ends, with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> carping that he
plays every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> as a charming lout. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Click</ENAMEX> here for the official
site.)

                  Proposals
               , by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neil Simon</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Broadhurst Theatre</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York City</ENAMEX>).
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Simon</ENAMEX> tries to write serious drama, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> find him as schmaltzy as ever.
His play, about the love lives of a '50s <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> and its black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">maid</ENAMEX>,
riffs on race and death. Reviewers take him to task for overworking his
trademark <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Borscht Belt</ENAMEX> repartee. Cardboard <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> and a contrived plot are
mere "conduits for the jokes" (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ben Brantley</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> ).

                  The
Dark <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Side of Camelot</ENAMEX>
               , by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Seymour M. Hersh</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Little, Brown & Co.</ENAMEX>).
Denunciations for an ace investigative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX>'s exposé of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John F. Kennedy</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Critics</ENAMEX> complain that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hersh</ENAMEX> repackages old accusations--e.g., that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JFK</ENAMEX> dallied
with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mafia</ENAMEX>--in "heavy-handed sensationalism" (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Brinkley</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> ). They find no evidence for some outlandish claims (e.g., that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kennedy</ENAMEX> was blackmailed into picking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LBJ</ENAMEX> as his running mate in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1960</TIMEX>) and only
thin evidence for others (many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> are anonymous, and some named sources
claim they were misquoted). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Evan Thomas</ENAMEX> suggests <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hersh</ENAMEX>'s zeal
for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">muckraking</ENAMEX> has "consumed him." (
                  Slate
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">'s Jacob Weisberg</ENAMEX>
disagrees in his review of the book.)

            

               
                  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alfred C. Kinsey</ENAMEX>: A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Public/Private Life</ENAMEX>
               , by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James H. Jones</ENAMEX>
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Norton</ENAMEX>). The biography exposes the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pioneer</ENAMEX> sexologist as a gay <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">masochist</ENAMEX> who
organized and filmed orgies. Many applaud the book's conclusion that his
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">perversions</TIMEX> distort his studies. Others find the book cynical, "simplistic and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">patronizing"</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Rhodes</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times Book Review</ENAMEX> ). They say
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kinsey</ENAMEX>'s private life bears no relation to his scholarship, and they question
the biography's anonymous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Republic</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Wolfe</ENAMEX> finds
similarities between <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jones</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kinsey</ENAMEX>: Both are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voyeurs</ENAMEX> who exaggerate their
subject's sexual activity. (See <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Laqueur</ENAMEX>'s review in

                  Slate
                and read an excerpt from the book.)

            
               
                  Joy
of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Cooking: The All-Purpose Cookbook</ENAMEX>
                (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scribner</ENAMEX>). The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">sixth</NUMEX> version of
the classic cookbook occasions nostalgia for the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1931</TIMEX> original. Praise goes to
its new emphasis on convenience--many recipes require <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">just 20 minutes</TIMEX>--and its
inclusion of such ethnic dishes as tapas and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">noodles</ENAMEX>. It is also
said to be more accurate and better organized, with fewer chatty digressions.
But most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> regret the disappearance of the "quirky personal voice" of the
original <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. Louis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">society matron</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Irma S. Rombauer</ENAMEX>. The book is "no
longer a guide to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> life and an antidote to the worries of its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">era</TIMEX>" (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Molly</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O'Neill</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> ). (The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Joy of Cooking</ENAMEX> site
plugs the book and gives its history.)

               "The
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Warhol Look/Glamour Fashion Style"</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whitney Museum</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York City</ENAMEX>). An
exhibition of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foppish</ENAMEX> pop <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX>'s ephemera--his clothes, souvenirs, and
photos--is panned as unexpectedly boring and blindly reverential of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Warhol</ENAMEX>.
Items exemplifying the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX>'s campy humor (his massive <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Barbie Doll</ENAMEX>
collection, his teen-age scrapbook of celebrity photos) are said to be scarce.
Many of the other articles (such as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Versace</ENAMEX> dress that uses <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Warhol</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marilyn</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monroe</ENAMEX> face) never even belonged to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX> and serve only to make
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tendentious</ENAMEX> points about art and fashion. Besides, complains <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> 's
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark Stevens</ENAMEX>, there are "more dresses on display than paintings." (The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whitney</ENAMEX>
plugs the exhibition.)
