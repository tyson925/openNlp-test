campaign (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">"Size Does Matter"</ENAMEX>) over the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$130 million</NUMEX> remake of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">1954</ENAMEX> classic,

movie is "so slapdash it makes <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Independence Day</ENAMEX> look like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry James</ENAMEX>,"
says the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Holden</ENAMEX>. Nostalgia reigns for the campy
charm of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> original. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Devlin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Emmerich's Godzilla</ENAMEX> is
accused of being annoyingly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spielbergian</ENAMEX> and lacking personality as well as
wits: "Any <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">forefather</ENAMEX> (and, given his reproductive capacities, foremother) of a
new <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> that chooses to travel halfway around the globe to lay his <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX> in

               ). The film's failure (it's doing relatively
poorly at the box office) may also be due to overexposure to disaster movies.

the lack of a plot, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> say, there's a senselessly spinning camera meant to
