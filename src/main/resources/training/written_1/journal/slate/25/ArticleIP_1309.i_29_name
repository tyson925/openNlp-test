                  Titanic
                (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">th Century Fox</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Cameron</ENAMEX>'s
budget-busting epic, expected to be a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Waterworld</ENAMEX> -style flop, winds up
getting mostly good reviews. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Critics</ENAMEX> praise <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cameron</ENAMEX> for evoking vintage
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">romances</ENAMEX> rather than schlocky disaster movies. "Titanic floods
you with elemental passion in a way that invites comparison with ... <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">D.W.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Griffith</ENAMEX>," says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Entertainment Weekly</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Owen Gleiberman</ENAMEX>. Critics
especially like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leonardo DiCaprio</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kate Winslet</ENAMEX> as the star-crossed young
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lovers</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dissenters</ENAMEX> gripe about hackneyed dialogue, stock <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX>, and too
much melodrama. (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Edelstein</ENAMEX> reviews the
film in 
                  Slate

                  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deconstructing Harry</ENAMEX>
                (Fine Line Features). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Woody Allen</ENAMEX>'s
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">28 th</NUMEX> feature--about a misogynistic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">novelist</ENAMEX> who disguises his own
life in his stories--is deemed his darkest. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> gush over it, ranking
it alongside his <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">'70s</NUMEX> classics. They laud his intermingling of fiction and
reality, his fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">one-liners</ENAMEX>, and the all-star ensemble <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cast</ENAMEX> (which includes
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robin Williams</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Demi Moore</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kirstie Alley</ENAMEX>). Others find the humor too
vicious to be funny and accuse <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allen</ENAMEX> of justifying his own misdeeds. "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Woody</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allen</ENAMEX> has wound up making a fetish of himself, and it's beginning to be
embarrassing," says <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Denby</ENAMEX>. (See <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Edelstein</ENAMEX>'s

within the film spoofs the original <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scream</ENAMEX> ). Some find the
self-consciousness over the top. "[<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX>]hat once was a fun <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> of twisting

                (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fox</ENAMEX>; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Mondays</TIMEX>; <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9 p.m. EST</TIMEX>/PST). After premiering to mixed
reviews, this show about a neurotic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard</ENAMEX>-educated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> gains a cult
following. Giving it a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> look, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> attribute the show's appeal to its
unconventional plots and insights into contemporary young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. "Irresistible
television, whether you experience it as a sexual-differences safari or as a
blueprint for your own life" (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ken Tucker</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Entertainment Weekly</ENAMEX> ). Others
attack it as retrograde: a "male <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producer</ENAMEX>'s wet dream of ... [the] postfeminist
career <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>, ... beaten down, and not so secretly hungry for a good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> to
fill the aching void of her life," says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Carson</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Village</ENAMEX>

<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">York City</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Met</ENAMEX>'s retrospective of the campy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designer</ENAMEX>'s clothing stirs up
debate. Some praise the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> for its uncharacteristic timeliness and for
recognizing that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Versace</ENAMEX> "was one of the fashion <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">titans</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this century</TIMEX>" (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Julia</ENAMEX>
Szabo, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsday</ENAMEX> ). Others say the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Met</ENAMEX> unwittingly reveals the mediocrity
of his designs, which got noticed only because <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">celebrities</ENAMEX> wore them. In the
Wall Street <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francine Prose</ENAMEX> accuses the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">curators</ENAMEX> of inflating
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">designer</ENAMEX>'s import with implausible claims that he was influenced by Yeats
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kandinsky</ENAMEX>. (The exhibit is plugged here.)

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">extravaganzas</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Critics</ENAMEX> applaud <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taniguchi</ENAMEX>'s design plan to double <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MoMA</ENAMEX>'s

(<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce Cook</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post Book World</ENAMEX> ). The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> accept <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Uglow</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">revisionist</ENAMEX> claim that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hogarth</ENAMEX>'s famous moralizing was accompanied by a

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samuel Johnson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Fielding</ENAMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> weigh in against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amistad</ENAMEX>. Their biggest complaint: It's too much of a Spielbergian
spectacle. "[<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>]oo much of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amistad</ENAMEX> feels as if it's been lifted from the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lore</ENAMEX> and language of movies rather than life," says the Wall Street
