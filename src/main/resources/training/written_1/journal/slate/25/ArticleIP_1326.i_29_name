                (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia Pictures</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Critics</ENAMEX> wonder why <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Billy Crystal</ENAMEX>'s recent
movies aren't as funny as his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oscar</ENAMEX>-night performances. This time they say he
is outperformed by co-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">star</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gheorghe Muresan</ENAMEX>, a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">7-foot-7-inch</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">basketball</ENAMEX> player
who can hardly speak <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>. They say <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crystal</ENAMEX> tries too hard to be likable
even though his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> is a slimy <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> who exploits <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Muresan</ENAMEX>.
Others blame the story, co-written by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crystal</ENAMEX>, for its facile morality lessons.
"<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Comedy</ENAMEX> and pathos keep getting in each other's way," says the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Globe</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jay Carr</ENAMEX>. (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Clips</ENAMEX> are available here.)

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Angeles Times</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth Turan</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pluses</ENAMEX>: beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">panoramas</ENAMEX> of Los Angeles

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">film</ENAMEX>'s New Age spirituality, its sentimental ending, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cage</ENAMEX>'s lack of acting
range. He speaks, says the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Holden</ENAMEX>, in "a hushed,
gee-whiz semi-whisper that's meant to convey profundity but ... sounds like the
shallow come-on of a cult <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX>." (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Click</ENAMEX> here for the official

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">provocateur Michael Moore</ENAMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger & Me</ENAMEX> ) hounds <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">CEOs</ENAMEX>. Most
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> love his pointed satire, especially such antics as offering <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nike</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> a free ticket to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indonesia</ENAMEX> so he can visit his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>'s sweatshops
there. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moore</ENAMEX>'s shtick, says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Entertainment Weekly</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Owen Gleiberman</ENAMEX>,
"shows more <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> enterprise than anything it's attacking." Others find
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moore</ENAMEX> self-aggrandizing. This film is "about the upsizing of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Moore</ENAMEX>,"
who is guilty of "oily smugness and sublime narcissism" (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Hunter</ENAMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> ).

for the made-for-TV version of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aldous Huxley</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1932</TIMEX> dystopian novel. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Reviewers</ENAMEX>

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">express</ENAMEX> amazement at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Huxley</ENAMEX>'s uncanny foresight. "Certain features of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Huxley</ENAMEX>'s

realities within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few decades</TIMEX>" (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dorothy Rabinowitz</ENAMEX>, the Wall Street

gratuitously injects a happy ending and melodrama: "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Huxley</ENAMEX> has been networked."

behind-the-scenes machinations during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1968</TIMEX> presidential campaign. The
book's prodigious research is taken to validate the view of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX>'s
presidency as a Shakespearean tragedy in which his megalomaniacal commitment to
the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Vietnam War</ENAMEX> ruined his ambitious liberal domestic agenda.

to pass off his "biography" of a nonexistent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painter</ENAMEX> as authentic. At an A-list

credulous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> say the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX>'s gullibility proves the New
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">York</ENAMEX> art <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">establishment</ENAMEX>'s "utter obliviousness to the ridiculous" (the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guardian</ENAMEX> ). Stateside, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Plagens</ENAMEX> insists that
"hardly anybody was duped."

            

               
                  <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Quarantine</ENAMEX>
               , by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Crace</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Farrar, Straus & Giroux</ENAMEX>). The
celebrated <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arcadia</ENAMEX> ), who has been short listed for
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Booker Prize</ENAMEX>, wins praise as an anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norman Mailer</ENAMEX> for his brash
novel about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus</ENAMEX>' life. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Crace</ENAMEX>'s version, a rebellious, bratty <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus</ENAMEX> dies of
starvation at the end of his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40-day</TIMEX> sojourn in the wilderness. Unlike <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mailer</ENAMEX>'s
"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">autobiography" of Christ, The Gospel According to the Son</ENAMEX> ,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quarantine</ENAMEX> is lauded for its historical accuracy, lyrical prose, and

Canby, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> ). His faults are said to range from the small
(he can't render accents) to the large (he exhibits the "charisma of a week-old
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lettuce</ENAMEX>," says the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Daily News ' Fintan O'Toole</ENAMEX>). The
