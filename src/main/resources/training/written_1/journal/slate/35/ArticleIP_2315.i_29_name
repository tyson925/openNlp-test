            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan Morales</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">attorney</ENAMEX>
general of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>, was the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney general</ENAMEX> to begin investigating
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18 months ago</TIMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November</TIMEX> he filed suit to void clauses in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>'s contracts with computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturers</ENAMEX> that he said were preventing
them from assisting his <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX>. Though this case was dismissed, Morales
persevered, joining with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> other state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys general</ENAMEX> in preparing a
wide-ranging antitrust suit against 
                  Slate
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'s</ENAMEX> parent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>.

            But last
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week</TIMEX>, at the very last moment, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morales</ENAMEX> dropped out of the suit. Why? First, he
received a letter from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heads</ENAMEX> of several <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>, including
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Compaq</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CompUSA</ENAMEX>, urging him not to bring a case that would harm an industry
employing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 300,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Texans</ENAMEX>. Then, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Dell</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX> of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Austin</ENAMEX>-based computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> that is both a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ally</ENAMEX> and one of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>'
largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employers</ENAMEX>, came by to see him. Just after that meeting, Morales
announced he wouldn't sue, explaining in a prepared statement that "several
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>' computer industry have expressed concerns that the filing
of a lawsuit against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> may negatively impact their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> as well as
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>."

            The antitrust case against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> may or may not have
merit. And it may or may not make sense for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> to run their own
antitrust policies alongside or in opposition to the national one. But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morales</ENAMEX>'
decision is pretty shocking in any event. If <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>' chief legal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> is
going to take it upon himself to decide whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> should be prosecuted,
that decision should be based on whether he believes the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> has violated
the law. Instead, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morales</ENAMEX> openly interpreted his duty as promoting his <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>'s
commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">interests</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morales</ENAMEX> said, in effect, I don't care whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>
is breaking the law. The issue is whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> is good for business in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>.

            Of course,
Morales was merely explicit where other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AGs</ENAMEX> prefer to be coy. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tiny Utah</ENAMEX>, home
to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Novell</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rival</ENAMEX>, is a vigorous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participant</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>' suit.
Tiny <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Dakota</ENAMEX>, home to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ally</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gateway</ENAMEX>, is not. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>, where
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Netscape</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oracle</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sun</ENAMEX> live, has signed on. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>
state, where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> lives, has declined. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Attorney General</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christine Gregoire</ENAMEX> determined that there was "no need" to duplicate the federal
effort.

            
In the curiously booming business of multistate
lawsuits, economic factors often interfere with lofty considerations of the
law. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Moore</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney general</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mississippi</ENAMEX>, sued to recover
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicaid</ENAMEX> costs from the tobacco industry in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX>--a case that led to the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$368.5</NUMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">billion</NUMEX> tobacco settlement now up for debate in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>--<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41</NUMEX> other states
eventually joined in. Among the few that did not were the biggest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">producers</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tobacco</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Carolina</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kentucky</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tennessee</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Georgia</ENAMEX>.

            You'd
have to be pretty naive to expect political considerations to play no part in
the deliberations of any public <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecutor</ENAMEX>, even in criminal cases. But
multistate actions, as these sign-up-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sheet</ENAMEX> lawsuits are called, are almost
pure politics. They generally reflect the ambitions of state elected
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> rather that the claims of sound public policy.

            If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Electric</ENAMEX> is selling an unsafe toaster, we have a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Consumer Product Safety Commission</ENAMEX> with jurisdiction to investigate, regulate,
and litigate. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CPSC</ENAMEX> must decide whether that toaster should be sold to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> anywhere in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>. Does it make sense for each <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> to be deciding
that question all over again--either agreeing, in which case the effort is
redundant, or disagreeing, in which case the result is a toaster that is legal
in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX> but illegal in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kentucky</ENAMEX>? It's like every state having its own foreign
policy--which happens to be another futility-generating trend. Multistate suits
add another layer of absurdity: the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> reinventing the wheel of federalism
by attempting to act in unison.

            The flurry
of multistate lawsuits is the result of an odd <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">alliance</ENAMEX> between liberal legal
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">activism</ENAMEX> and conservative devolutionary zeal. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1970s</TIMEX>, the consumer
movement fired up state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys general</ENAMEX> to begin going after corporate
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">malefactors</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> multistate actions was a suit filed by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">six</TIMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys general</ENAMEX> against oil <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> for price fixing in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1973</TIMEX>. Another was
filed against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Motors</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1977</TIMEX> for falsely claiming that some of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX>
contained rocket engines. Such suits increased with the falloff in consumer
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">protection</ENAMEX> and antitrust enforcement during the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>. The regulatory
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> have grown more aggressive since <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Clinton</ENAMEX> arrived in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>. But somehow, more federal activism has only spurred the litigious
exuberance of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AGs</ENAMEX>. Various <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> have recently gone after deceptive
advertising in car leasing, sneaker price fixing, and telemarketing scams. At
the moment, they are shadowing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX> in an antitrust
investigation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Visa</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MasterCard</ENAMEX>.

            
Perhaps the biggest factor in the multistate
litigation boom is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moore</ENAMEX>. As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Pringle</ENAMEX> recounts in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cornered</ENAMEX> , a new
book about <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-</ENAMEX>tobacco litigation, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moore</ENAMEX> turned himself into a household name
with his suit against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Tobacco</ENAMEX>. As the suit progressed, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moore</ENAMEX> was featured
in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vanity Fair</ENAMEX> and on every TV news program known to humankind. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Law Journal</ENAMEX> named him <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Moore</ENAMEX>
incurred some suspicion and jealousy from his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX>. He also became their
role model. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hubert H. "Skip" Humphrey III</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney general</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minnesota</ENAMEX>,
filed his own suit against the tobacco <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>. It was settled <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX> for
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$6.1 billion</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Humphrey</ENAMEX> used the occasion to attack <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moore</ENAMEX>'s settlement as a
"sweetheart deal."

            Now all
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AGs</ENAMEX> want to be the next <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Moore</ENAMEX>. There are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX> willing to help. As one
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington PR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> explains, these cases are often marketed to the state
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys general</ENAMEX> by corporate and public-interest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lobbyists</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX> they go to
the most eager beavers: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skip Humphrey or Richard Blumenthal</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Connecticut</ENAMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX> tier, but nearly as promising, are <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morales</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scott Harshbarger</ENAMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Massachusetts</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dennis Vacco</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>. Another good source of lawsuits
is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Association of Attorneys General</ENAMEX> (known informally as the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Association of Aspiring Governors</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">NAAG</ENAMEX> meets <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> times a year so
its various <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committees</ENAMEX> can hash out ideas for litigation, like the billing
fraud case now being developed against the hospital <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX>.

            In the case of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blumenthal</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Connecticut</ENAMEX> appears
to have won the coveted <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prize</ENAMEX>, managing to eclipse <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iowa</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Attorney General</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Miller</ENAMEX>, who is <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NAAG</ENAMEX>'s antitrust <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committee</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>'s
Vacco, who heads the consumer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committee</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blumenthal</ENAMEX>'s face has been everywhere
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last week</TIMEX>, and he is clearly enjoying his moment in the limelight,
building valuable name recognition for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> when he decides whether to run
for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senator</ENAMEX>. Others may pause to wonder why <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Connecticut</ENAMEX>--and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX>
other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>--needs an antitrust policy separate from that of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX>. The question whether regulation of commerce is a state or national
affair was supposed to have been settled in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1789</TIMEX>.
