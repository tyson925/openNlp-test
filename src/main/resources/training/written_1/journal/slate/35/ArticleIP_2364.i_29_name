            Let us pause, during the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX>' <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year-long</TIMEX> celebration of its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">100-year</TIMEX> march to
journalistic dominance, to glance at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX> that may dominate the next
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">century</ENAMEX> of print journalism (if there is one): <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA Today</ENAMEX> , a newspaper
that scarcely needs a Web site (though, of course, it has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>), because its
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">front</ENAMEX> is a home page in print.

            For all
its obvious yearning for marketability and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX>-friendliness, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA Today</ENAMEX>
built its circulation without resorting to tabloid sensationalism. From the law
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX> to the tennis <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courts</ENAMEX>, it covers the news straightforwardly. But what
does <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McPaper</ENAMEX> stand for? What is the philosophy of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA Today</ENAMEX> ?

            Large-circulation <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX>, to be sure, don't
market philosophy, except sideways. A major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX> is supposed to be a team
effort, a nonideological pursuit of the objective truth. Asking for its
official philosophy is like demanding the creed of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicago Bulls</ENAMEX>. The
likeliest payoff is a slogan on the order of "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Get it Over</ENAMEX>." With a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX>,
"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Get it Out</ENAMEX>" is about the best you can hope for. But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA Today</ENAMEX> is the
lengthened byline of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>, former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gannett</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">CEO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Neuharth</ENAMEX>--and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">flamboyant South Dakotan</ENAMEX> spent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> preaching the philosophy of his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>,
both before and after its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 1982</TIMEX> launch.

            
Neuharth, it turns out, is a more important <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20th-century</TIMEX> philosopher than
anyone expected. ("<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">We Find Al Philosophical</ENAMEX>," the in-house headline might
read.) His struggle through the start-up and red ink of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA Today</ENAMEX>
succeeded in bending <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> journalism to the principles of classical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
pragmatism.

            For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, media <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> pounded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA Today</ENAMEX> : An
"explosion in a paint <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factory</ENAMEX>," the "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">flashdance of editing</ENAMEX>," the "junk food of
journalism." Asked early on if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA Today</ENAMEX> could qualify as a top
newspaper, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ben Bradlee</ENAMEX> replied, "If it can, then
I'm in the wrong business." Post literary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jonathan Yardley</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">condemned USA Today</ENAMEX> for giving its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> "only what they want. No
spinach, no <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bran</ENAMEX>, no <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX>." <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Critics cast</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neuharth</ENAMEX> as the disreputable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heir</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Randolph Hearst</ENAMEX>. But try a different succession: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William James</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">John</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dewey; Al Neuharth</ENAMEX>.

            No,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William James</ENAMEX> didn't take off on "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buscapades</ENAMEX>." And <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Dewey</ENAMEX> didn't festoon
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> philosophy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> with the white onyx and black marble of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA Today</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rosslyn</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Va.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX>. But what, after all, were the
beliefs of the "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pragmatists</ENAMEX>," those <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heroes</ENAMEX> whose comeback in the
intellectual world (through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">present-day</TIMEX> scions like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Rorty</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Davidson</ENAMEX>) now makes them founts of wisdom to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">philosophers</ENAMEX> around the world?
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James</ENAMEX> urged us to think of true beliefs as those that point to successful
actions, most of which result (in the sense of pragmatism's coiner, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Charles</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sander Peirce</ENAMEX>) from a convergence of belief among our "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> of inquirers."
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James</ENAMEX> didn't mind if our beliefs occasionally took us a bit ahead of the
evidence (see his "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Will to Believe"</ENAMEX>), particularly if that passionate,
optimistic confidence stirred us to make the world better than it is.

            Such sentiments are practically the anthem of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>
Today , which brings together the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>'s "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> of inquirers" faster than
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerry Springer</ENAMEX> unites addled <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>. Some may see a latent liberalism (in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s sense) in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA Today</ENAMEX> 's editorial line: its espousal of gun
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> or publicly financed elections (to name to editorial positions taken by
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent weeks</TIMEX>). But the argument on these topics is no less
practical in tone and substance than its more "conservative" recent stands in
favor of public shaming as judicial punishment or its endorsement of hunting.
Policies are to be preferred if, in proven practice, they save lives--or
dollars. On the contentious issue of gerrymandering, racial or otherwise: The
practice is to be deplored not on grounds of high principle, but because, by
creating safe seats for one or another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> or interest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, it makes
"elections meaningless." Moreover, in pursuing racial fairness, there are
better alternatives available.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James</ENAMEX> declared: "There can
be no difference anywhere that doesn't make a difference
elsewhere." What paper better embodies that belief than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA Today</ENAMEX> , which
recently ran a graph on "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Rain and Drizzle: The Difference"</ENAMEX>? ("The difference is
the size of the drops, with drizzle drops <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">less than 0.02 inches</NUMEX> in diameter,
falling close together, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rains</ENAMEX> drops larger than <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.02 inches</NUMEX> in diameter,
widely separated.")

            As for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dewey</ENAMEX>, he threw out
the false distinction between theoretical inquiry and practical
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">decision-making</ENAMEX>, proclaiming that all thinking amounts to problem-solving. For
the author of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Experience and Nature and A Common Faith</ENAMEX>, the
smartest way to educate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> was to give them the information and skills
necessary to solve their problems--not to point them to an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authority</ENAMEX> who'd tell
them what to think or solve their problems for them. Which would be the paper
of choice for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> with such a mind-set: the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> ?

            Dewey
himself liked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peirce</ENAMEX>'s definition of truth as the "opinion" on which all
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> are "fated to be agreed." More than most papers, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA Today</ENAMEX>
steps aside and delivers the experience that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dewey</ENAMEX> considered necessary to that
convergence on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solutions</ENAMEX>: statistics, direct lengthy quotations, complete box
scores. Why, it even runs pages entitled "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Solutions</ENAMEX>." ("<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Trucks: What Needs to</ENAMEX>
Be Done."). Mindful of the fragility of "truth," and trustful of how a better
"truth" might emerge from experimentation and debate, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dewey</ENAMEX> thought we might
well drop the whole concept of "truth" and speak more usefully of "warranted
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assertibility</ENAMEX>." Does any editorial page so clearly reflect that belief as
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA Today</ENAMEX> 's, with its regular "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Opposing Opinion</ENAMEX>" and cross section of
positions?

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Neuharth</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> articulations of his metaphysics
came in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 1983</TIMEX>, in a speech to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Overseas Press Club</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>. As
recalled by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Prichard</ENAMEX> in his book, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Making of McPaper</ENAMEX> , Neuharth
condemned the "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">old journalism of despair</ENAMEX>," a "derisive technique of leaving
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> discouraged, or mad, or indignant." In its place, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neuharth</ENAMEX> declared,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA Today</ENAMEX> delivered a "journalism of hope"--an enterprise one can
imagine James franchising under his "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Will to Believe</ENAMEX>." It offered reportage
that "chronicles the good, the bad, and the otherwise, and leaves <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> fully
informed and equipped to judge what deserves their attention and support."

            
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Neuharth</ENAMEX> imposed his philosophy on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">newsroom</ENAMEX>. Stories deliver facts and
information with minimal interference from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX> eager to be literary. As a
result, sentences are short and clear, often brilliantly compressed. "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>
Snapshots" and other regular graphs abound. Lengthy quotations from transcribed
interviews let <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> hear newsmakers directly. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA Today</ENAMEX> 's modular
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">layout</ENAMEX> and bold type anticipated the typical multidimensional Web page, almost
inviting the finger to point and click, to follow <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Christine Royal</ENAMEX> through the
process of her cosmetic surgery, to jump to the daily profiles of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Olympic</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">athletes</ENAMEX>, to explore the depths of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bosnia</ENAMEX> power struggle. [See displayed
picture of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 1,1996</TIMEX>, front page.] Headlines are supposed to emphasize the
positive. About the crash of a charter <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malaga</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>: "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miracle</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">327</ENAMEX>
survive, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55</NUMEX> die." <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Neuharth</ENAMEX> criticized a headline about a health study that
read, "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Death Rate Drops</ENAMEX>," saying it should have read, "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">We're Living</ENAMEX>
Longer."

            
Other devices ensure that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA Today</ENAMEX> 's
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> keep the focus on the exact community the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> covered: the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA To</ENAMEX>
Neuharth, that meant the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>, not "<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>." In a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1985</TIMEX> memo, Neuharth
threatened to transfer out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> who sloppily allowed
"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">America</ENAMEX>" or "<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>" into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> when they meant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX>
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. Personal pronouns anchor the headlines as they drive home
an idea James and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dewey</ENAMEX> would have welcomed--the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX> as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> big
first-person-plural community. Classics included "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">We Move Less Often</ENAMEX>" and
"We're in the Mood to Buy." If the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Post</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> for
immortality was "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Headless Body in Topless Bar</ENAMEX>," <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA Today</ENAMEX> `s might have
been "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eating</ENAMEX> its <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Vegetables</ENAMEX>."

            Yet, even in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA Today</ENAMEX> 's recent in-the-black <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> has been a magnet for negative media-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critic</ENAMEX> boilerplate. In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Read</ENAMEX>
All <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">About It</ENAMEX>! (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>), an attack on newfangled newspapering by ousted
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicago Tribune</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Squires</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poppin</ENAMEX>' mad former honcho
railed that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA Today</ENAMEX> "adopted an editorial philosophy designed to avoid
all controversy." In <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Who Stole the News</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>), veteran <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX> correspondent
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mort Rosenblum</ENAMEX> recycled the standard yuck that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA Today</ENAMEX> "is for people
who find television too difficult."

            "Balderdash!" a
turn-of-the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deweyean</ENAMEX> might have replied. Is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA Today</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">uncontroversial</ENAMEX> because it opens up its agora, presuming truth will rise from a
clash of diverse debaters from all <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX> of the national polis?
Can it be more simplistic than television when its front page alone regularly
presents or capsulizes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 30</NUMEX> different news matters--far more than
you'll hear about on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> edition of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">World News Tonight</ENAMEX> ?

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> 's journalism fulfills the political philosophy of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Framers</ENAMEX>,
themselves heavily influenced by the ancient rhetoricians (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carl J.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Founders and the Classics</ENAMEX> ). Both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> favored the
Isocratic notion of a truth emerging from ongoing debate over the
Socratic notion of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Truth</ENAMEX> emerging from an old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kibitzer</ENAMEX>'s endless
dialectical probing. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA Today</ENAMEX> weds that impulse to the pragmatist
program: If you give the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> facts, if they identify an authentic
problematic situation in their environment, if you permit them to hear multiple
views, they'll converge on a truth that works.

            And so it happens <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA Today</ENAMEX> , as much as
it can in a paint-factory explosion. Big and small explanatory facts (how
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">airport</ENAMEX> security works, the percentage of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who screen each phone call,
why <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> reject technology jobs), and problematic issues (animal rights,
standards for criminal punishment) come together in a virtual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal of</ENAMEX>
Pragmatism. You say the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a century old</TIMEX>, and we
ought to join its celebration? <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nah</ENAMEX>--too Cartesian.

            Back in his early <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Dewey</ENAMEX> tried to start a newspaper. He failed. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Neuharth</ENAMEX> hasn't. He,
like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James</ENAMEX>, knows the meaning of cash value. If <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dewey</ENAMEX> lived <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>,
they'd be reading "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Snapshots</ENAMEX>," absorbing the blooming, buzzing confusion of
"Across the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>," and probably arranging for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Al Neuharth</ENAMEX> to give a few lectures
at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard</ENAMEX>.
