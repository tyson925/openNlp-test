            "We've just been sent a memo
telling us we're not supposed to talk to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX>," said the young male <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clerk</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">at Barnes & Noble</ENAMEX> when I asked if he was selling a lot of copies of The
Rules: <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Time Tested Secrets for Capturing the Heart</ENAMEX> of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Right</ENAMEX> , the
slender, much-publicized manual of retro dating strategy for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. "But
yes"--eyeball roll, sigh, grimace--"it's flying out of here." There went my
theory that the book's sales (advertised <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as 800,000</NUMEX>) reflected warehouse-size
orders from the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cabal</ENAMEX> that inflated the numbers for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ancient</ENAMEX>
Evenings , <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Closing of the American Mind , A Brief History of</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> , and many other supposed huge <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sellers</ENAMEX> that you've never actually seen
outside a bookstore. Choosing my copy from a miniwall of identical pink
paperbacks, I figured I should probably abandon my fallback theory too, which
is that the only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who take the Rules seriously are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalists</ENAMEX> assigned
to write about them. Certainly the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B & N</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clerk</ENAMEX>, a dating <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> if I ever saw
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>, took them seriously. "It's all about mind games," he volunteered
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">scornfully</ENAMEX>. "I hate that book."

            "Mind
games" is right. The thesis of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ellen Fein</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sherrie Schneider</ENAMEX>'s book is that
for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> who want to marry, lunacy is the best policy. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Women</ENAMEX> who take the
initiative--a broad category of behavior that includes most signs of life, not
to mention common politeness--"destroy male ambition and animal drive. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Men</ENAMEX> are
born to respond to challenge. Take away challenge and their interest wanes."
So, become a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rules Girl</ENAMEX>. Having first transformed yourself (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Rule 1</ENAMEX>) into
"a creature unlike any other"--radiant, confident, fashionable, mysterious,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">elusive</ENAMEX>, quiet, and, if necessary, nose-jobbed--don't talk to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> first (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>)
or too much (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>), don't go <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) or sleep with him on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first date</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">14</NUMEX>),
don't call him and rarely return his calls (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>), always end phone calls (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6</ENAMEX>) and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dates</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">11</NUMEX>) <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, and never accept a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">date</TIMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">7</ENAMEX>).
As you might expect from a book that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mingles</ENAMEX> pop <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Darwinism</ENAMEX> with the
Weltanschauung of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cosmopolitan</ENAMEX> , the Rules can be a bit mysterious
and elusive themselves--you can't introduce yourself to your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX>, but
taking out a personal ad is OK, and how's a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> to square the whole project of
"conditioning" the marriage-averse <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> with Rules <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Let Him Take the Lead</ENAMEX>)
and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Don't Expect a Man</ENAMEX> to Change or Try to Change Him)?

            You could see The Rules as a weird <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fantasia</ENAMEX> on the
theme of, "Why buy the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cow</ENAMEX> if you can get the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk</ENAMEX> for free?" But what sets it
apart from, say, "Dear <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abby</ENAMEX>," is the demented, quasi-military precision of the
Rules. Buy a timer and set it for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 minutes</TIMEX> when he calls. Practice the rules
on the doorman and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">butcher</ENAMEX>--let them say "hello" <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> to
you . If your <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">beau</ENAMEX> fails to come across with a "romantic gift" for your
birthday and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Valentine's Day</TIMEX>, he obviously doesn't love you; so show him the
door! Don't just read the Rules--memorize them. By the end of the book, when
you're being advised to join a support <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> to help you resist the urge to
have a normal conversation with your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boyfriend</ENAMEX>, the whole enterprise has a
distinctly cultish flavor. (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rule</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX>: Don't Discuss The Rules with Your
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Therapist</ENAMEX>.)

            
               The
Rules isn't just about manipulating <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>; it's about manipulating the reader
too. The eerie assurance with which the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> insist that the Rules always
work and that any deviation brings disaster is strangely nervous-making, like
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of those <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> letters that alludes darkly to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who dropped dead after
failing to pass it on. Could it possibly be that my <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>-<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year-long</TIMEX> marriage was
jinxed from <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Day One</ENAMEX> because I called my future <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> and suggested
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX>--in his neighborhood, yet, instead of my own? Actually, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">no. Life</ENAMEX>'s much
more complicated. Sure, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> like a challenge--but so do <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. And nobody likes
to be challenged all the time. I know plenty of long-standing happy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couples</ENAMEX> who
slept together right away, spent <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> yakking on the phone, split checks down
the middle, and lived together for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> before the wedding. The notion that
female initiative is useless because <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> know what they want is particularly
odd--most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> don't even know what they want for dinner. Even odder is the
notion that what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> want is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> who's always on her way out the door.

            Since The Rules do not reflect reality, what is
their appeal--and to whom? Undoubtedly, the book owes much of its visibility to
the general mood of anti-feminism and family-values conservatism. But to see
its popularity as evidence of rejection of feminism by "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>" is much too
vague. In the pages of The 
               Rules , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> are a barely individualized
collection of amiable dolts, but the Rules <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Girl</ENAMEX> is a particular social
type--and it isn't the choosy free spirit lectured in such anti-feminist
self-help books as Smart <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Women, Foolish Choices</ENAMEX> . The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> depicted as
in need of the Rules is a voracious doormat, the sort of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> who sends men
Hallmark greeting cards or long letters after a single date, who rummages in
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>'s drawers and pockets, suggests <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couples</ENAMEX> therapy when brief relationships
start to crumble, throws away a new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boyfriend</ENAMEX>'s old clothes, cleans (and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">redecorates</ENAMEX>) his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX> without asking, and refuses to see the most obvious
signs of disengagement. Her problem isn't too much liberation; it's incredibly
low self-esteem. For <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> like this, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Rules</ENAMEX> might seem like a way of
setting boundaries on a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personality</ENAMEX> that has none, of giving a sense of purpose
and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> to a life that seems "empty" (a recurrent word), of offering
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> who fear they are worthless a way of acting as if they were precious--"a
creature unlike any other"--in the hope that the pose may become reality. Of
course, this is unlikely--a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">motormouth</ENAMEX> cannot be "quiet and mysterious"
forever, timer or no timer, and The 
               Rules ' blithe assurance that
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Right</ENAMEX>, reeled in by your "friendly, light, and breezy" persona, will accept
your edgy, insecure, and engulfing true self is, perhaps, the cruelest fantasy
in the book.

            Although the Rules <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Girl</ENAMEX> is anything but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Everywoman</ENAMEX>,
the world depicted in the book is unfortunately the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> in which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of
single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> live: a corporatized and highly competitive world of
office jobs and aerobics <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX>, personal ads, nose jobs and diets, singles
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dances</ENAMEX>, self-help seminars, and spiritual fads. It's not a very warm or kind
world, or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> with much room for originality or playfulness or waywardness or
even what I would call "romance." <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Friends</ENAMEX> matter because you need someone to
rent a beach <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> or go to a singles dance with. Politics and volunteer work
and books are just ways to keep busy between dates.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Darwinian</ENAMEX> theme prominent
in much of the discussion about dating just now reflects this world well: men
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, different by nature and with innately opposed interests, each trying
to exploit the other <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>. You don't have to like the other sex--you don't
even have to like your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lover</ENAMEX>. You just have to need him or her--for sex,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">babies</ENAMEX>, "romantic gifts," attention, money, acceptability in a society
organized around the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX>. Indeed, the subtext of The 
               Rules is
resentment toward <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>: As the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> put it in their inimitable fashion,
"[<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>]he man is the adversary (if he's someone you really like)." Why? "He has
the power to hurt you ... he runs the show."

            When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">feminists</ENAMEX> suggest that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> run the show--any show--they get labeled <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>-haters and whiners. But then,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">feminists</ENAMEX> want to change the rules, not memorize them.
