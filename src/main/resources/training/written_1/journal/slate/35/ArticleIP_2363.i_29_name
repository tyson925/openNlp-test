            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Jefferson</ENAMEX> said, "The
government which governs best, governs least." But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jefferson</ENAMEX>'s wisdom needs
updating. The lesson of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20 th century</TIMEX> is clear: The government
which governs best, governs least efficiently.

            
Efficiency in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> is a more elusive concept than efficiency in the
private economy, which may be measured relatively easily as output per <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> of
input. What is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>'s "output"? But let us measure the efficiency of
a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> by how well it is able to implement its own goals, whatever they
may be. This could be quantified in terms of money, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, or the total
elapsed time between the adoption of a policy and its complete implementation.
A perfectly efficient <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> would find its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platforms</ENAMEX> instantly
implemented; a completely inefficient one would expend all its resources
without accomplishing any of its goals.

            By this reasonable standard, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> place in efficiency
must go to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">dictatorships</ENAMEX>--the more vile, the more efficient. The more absolute
the power of the local tyrant, the more rapidly and completely his policy
desires are implemented. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cruelty</ENAMEX> and unpredictability are the techniques of the
real efficiency <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dissidents</ENAMEX> complaining? Just shoot them. Minor minions
acting up? Torture them--making sure to include some of your previous
favorites--and the rest will snap into line. It does cost a few <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bullets</ENAMEX>, but
bullets are cheap. And there is always a friendly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arms merchant</ENAMEX> (usually from a
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> with an inefficient <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>) ready to sell you some, even to arrange
foreign aid to help with the financing.

            Despotic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> are so
efficient that they are easy to administer. Even the least capable or sane
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> can run them. Look at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caligula</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Idi Amin</ENAMEX>, and the current bÃªte
noire of the tin-hat set, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX>. Once the opposition is dead, and
all but the most compliant are purged from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dictator</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX>, what's there
to worry about? Foreign invaders or liberators? They usually serve to merely
entrench a tyrant.

            That these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> pillage
their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, destroy their economies, and leave no legacy apart from large
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Swiss</ENAMEX> bank accounts tends to obscure their achievements as models of
efficiency. This efficiency hurts the citizenry because, by and large, the sort
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> who wants to be a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dictator</ENAMEX> is rather nasty and self-serving. An
efficient <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> is dangerous in the hands of the wrong <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>. Sadly, the
right sort of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> never seems interested in the job.

            Hereditary
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">monarchies</ENAMEX> once provided a few well-meaning <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rulers</ENAMEX>. A despotic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX> might pass
power on to more enlightened progeny. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medici</ENAMEX> wasn't all that nice a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">guy</ENAMEX>, but by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lorenzo</ENAMEX>'s time, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medici</ENAMEX> stock had mellowed a bit. Such brief
windows of rationality did not last long, but they gave <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mankind</ENAMEX> a much-needed
break. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> flourished in small islands of such tolerance
amid a patchwork quilt of fiefdoms run by local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">strongmen</ENAMEX>.

            
There are no examples in the modern world of
absolute power being wielded for anything like the greater good--and it is hard
to imagine the situation arising. How would Mother <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Teresa</ENAMEX> ever come to
power? Absolute power may corrupt absolutely, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">applicant</ENAMEX> pool for this
sort of job isn't pristine to begin with.

            The record of holy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rulers</ENAMEX> is
none too good anyway--religious <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">regimes</ENAMEX> tend to rank right after outright thugs
when it comes to efficiency. The mandate of God might seem like the ultimate
tool of power, but in practice, a theocracy is less efficient than the
whimsical brutality of a lone, unfettered <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ruler</ENAMEX>. This is not to say that
religious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> can't be brutal--they are, as a rule--but rather, that
they are bound by more constraints. The word of God generally is written in
some ambiguous form that is open to interpretation, and there is never a
shortage of interpreters. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> of a religious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">dictatorship</ENAMEX> must always
be on guard against some <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">holier-than-thou</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">revisionist</ENAMEX> bearing a new and
improved "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Truth</ENAMEX>." In addition, the deity has a funny habit of prescribing more
rules and regulations than even liberal <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX> do, thus distracting
religious regimes with random rituals and requirements. Religious movements are
at their most efficient when they seek very basic goals--like subjugating women
or stifling free thought. Complex agendas are much more difficult for them to
accomplish.

            Military <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">dictatorships</ENAMEX>
generally are less efficient than those run by lone <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">despots</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clergy</ENAMEX>.
Every self-respecting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dictator</ENAMEX> will decorate himself with grand military
titles--but let us set these baubles aside and concentrate on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">dictatorships</ENAMEX> run
by genuine career military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX>. Perhaps it is the military respect for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rank</ENAMEX>, discipline, and the maintenance of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> of command, or--more
likely--the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">military</ENAMEX> love of acronyms and paperwork in triplicate. For whatever
reason, true military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> are generally less effectual than plain old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">thugs</ENAMEX>
and zealots (although their political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponents</ENAMEX> get just as dead). As further
proof of my thesis, rank seems to correlate well with inefficiency: Few of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generals</ENAMEX> who have served their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">despots</ENAMEX> can hold a candle,
efficiency-wise, to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Col.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Qaddafi</ENAMEX>. And it was a sad day indeed for hapless
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Liberia</ENAMEX> when it suffered the ignominy of a coup led by a master <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sergeant</ENAMEX>.

            The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Communists</ENAMEX> briefly occupied an intermediate stage in the hierarchy of
inefficiency. Condemned in their heyday as having total or "totalitarian"
power, their regimes were later revealed as corrupt <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bureaucracies</ENAMEX>, more
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inefficient</ENAMEX> (and thus better) than we believed. Dismal images of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Russia</ENAMEX>
unraveling after communism collapsed make an unintended point: At least there
was something to unravel, unlike in so much of the rest of the world. Poor
communism was inefficient enough that its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> were able to accomplish some
things despite it, but efficient enough that they couldn't have cable TV. It
sat like a ball on a hill: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ultimately</ENAMEX>, it had to roll down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> side of the hill
and collapse into democracy, or roll the other way and devolve into the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personality-cult despotism</ENAMEX> of a local tyrant. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tito</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Castro</ENAMEX> are examples of
the latter, and they may soon have imitators, for it remains to be seen how
many post-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">democracies</ENAMEX> will last.

            It is popularly supposed (particularly by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who live
in them) that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">democracies</ENAMEX> are "good," while various forms of despotism are
"bad." The evidence favors a far simpler proposition. Simply put, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX>
are bad. The fundamental prerogative of governing is to control the actions of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>, and this power is remarkably prone to misuse. Quibbling that evil
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> are to blame, not the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> itself, is a pathetic
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">evasion</ENAMEX>, reminiscent of an NRA bumper sticker that reads, "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Governments</ENAMEX> don't
kill <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, only criminal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> kill <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>." Sorry, but with a <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1-1</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">correspondence</ENAMEX>, why exempt the mechanism? Without the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> of government
behind them, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pol Pot</ENAMEX> would have been fairly harmless and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hitler</ENAMEX>, a third-rate
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX>. With it, each killed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ted Bundy</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> behind him
would have been a lot worse than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ted Bundy</ENAMEX> operating solo.

            The examples of great evil
done by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> are easy enough to rattle off. But what about the examples
of great good to balance them? There aren't any. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Politicians</ENAMEX> and other
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">apologists</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX> gamely assert the supposed benefits of
government, but it is a short and shallow list. Good is done, to be sure, but
in little dribs and drabs that aren't enough to cover the cost. How many
centuries of good <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> would it take to balance the score for the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cambodians</ENAMEX>?

            The reason
societies with democratic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> are better places to live in than their
alternatives isn't because of some goodness intrinsic to democracy, but because
its hopeless inefficiency helps blunt the basic potential for evil. The
constraint of maintaining constant popularity is simply too large a burden to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bear</ENAMEX>. So, happily, very little gets done that is extremely bad--or extremely
good.

            
Democracy could always make itself efficient by
voting to anoint an absolute <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ruler</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democratic</ENAMEX> procedures brought <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adolf Hitler</ENAMEX>
to power, for example. But this rarely happens. Instead, democracies evolved
ever more elaborate ways of tying the hands of their chosen <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX>.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prize</ENAMEX> for ultimate
inefficiency goes to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>. We have built in so many checks and balances that
our "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX>" are the most thoroughly hogtied of any on earth. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few weeks</TIMEX>
those of us who overcome inertia and apathy will enter polling places to choose
our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>, with less real choice than ever. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> has tried to
outdo the other in adopting popular centrist <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stances</ENAMEX> and avoiding anything
difficult. We can rest assured that neither <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> will challenge the fundamental
structure that will render winner and loser ineffectual, come <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Inauguration Day</ENAMEX>.
Perhaps it would be better to have a restrained and less intrusive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>,
as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jefferson</ENAMEX> envisioned. A pleasant thought, but one that relies on politicians
to restrain themselves. Better to let them restrain each other through
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inefficiency</ENAMEX>, caught in a morass of checks and balances, our freedom guarded
not by fierce virtue but, rather, by simple unfeasibility. Not an elegant
result, but a practical <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>. I think, in this sense, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jefferson</ENAMEX> would be
pleased.
