            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Penile</ENAMEX> injections are the
most frequently prescribed antidote for male impotence. According to the
medical literature, the FDA-approved <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medication</ENAMEX> works like this:

            The
impotent excuses himself from foreplay with his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> and enters the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bathroom</ENAMEX>. Here, he fills a syringe with the muscle-relaxant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">prostaglandin</ENAMEX> and
swabs a spot near the base of his penis with rubbing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX>. Next, clasping
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of his penis with one hand, the impotent inserts the needle about two
centimeters into the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">shaft</ENAMEX>. The needle must penetrate to the corpora
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cavernosa</ENAMEX>--the rods of spongy tissue in the penis core. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> plunges the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">syringe</ENAMEX> and almost immediately the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">prostaglandin</ENAMEX> loosens the muscles that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> circulation to the penis. The sting passes quickly and blood rushes
in--even a penis that has been limp for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX> will spring to erection. To
prevent the puncture from turning black and blue, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">impotent</ENAMEX> applies pressure
to the spot for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the next 30 seconds</TIMEX>.

            Finally, after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five minutes</TIMEX> or so, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">impotent</ENAMEX> emerges
from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bathroom</ENAMEX> sporting a dandy hard-on, not to mention the confidence that
his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coach</ENAMEX> won't turn into a pumpkin for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">half an hour</TIMEX>, regardless of how many
times he orgasms.

            Thanks to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">prostaglandin</ENAMEX>, an
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">economy</ENAMEX>, even a culture, of impotence now flourishes in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>. Extrapolating
from local studies, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">urologists</ENAMEX> estimate that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 200,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> injected the
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> into their sex organ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> (at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $20</NUMEX> a pop), and a total of
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">650,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> sought treatments for impotence, up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">43 percent</NUMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX>.

            According
to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Business Week</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> spent <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">an estimated $665 million</NUMEX> in pursuit of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">erection</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinics</ENAMEX> that diagnose impotence and teach the afflicted how
to inject themselves have set up shop in most major <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>. Doing
business under academic-sounding names like "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Integrated Medical Resources</ENAMEX>,"
these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinics</ENAMEX> advertise their services on all-sports radio <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stations</ENAMEX>, cable TV
channels, and mass transit. (The bus ads give impotence treatment a friendly
face, usually depicting a balding, pocket-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">protector</ENAMEX>-wearing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX>.) Impotence
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> have also helped found <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55</NUMEX> chapters of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Impotents Anonymous</ENAMEX>, and dozens
of telephone hot lines, to help the unarousable cope and steer them to medical
treatment. Plus, pharmaceutical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> are racing to develop simpler ways to
deliver the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> than injections. A tiny tablet cooked up by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pfizer</ENAMEX>, awaiting
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> approval, allows <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> to stuff a drug similar to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">prostaglandin</ENAMEX> straight into
their urethra.

            
When urologists pitch impotence cures,
investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bankers</ENAMEX> and venture <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">capitalists</ENAMEX> swoon--and for good reason. Between
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 and 30 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> suffer from impotence, most of them around the
age of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX>. Not only do most of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> have the time to fret over their
fading virility, most have the disposable income to indulge their <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">anxieties</ENAMEX>.
And the demographic is burgeoning, giving a new meaning to the phrase "baby
boom."

            But the culture of impotence
cannot be reduced to money-grubbing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> and Wall Street <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shysters</ENAMEX> exploiting
the worst fears of the graying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">golf course</ENAMEX>. The conventional wisdom
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about</NUMEX> impotence has changed: What was once considered a normal part of the
aging process is now considered a treatable medical condition. "If a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> has a
penis he can get an erection," says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Irwin Goldstein</ENAMEX>, author of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Potent</ENAMEX>
Male and a urologist at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boston University</ENAMEX>. "[<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Prostaglandin</ENAMEX>] is literally a
magic potion that powerfully restores--safely, without any side effects--what
was once lost," says the Web site of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Uri Peles</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">urologist</ENAMEX>. New
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">urologist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward Moses</ENAMEX> employs the same overheated rhetoric on his Web
site: "For many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>, life without sex can be likened to a watercolor painting
that should possess all of the vibrant colors of life, but which has been
reduced to sterile black and white."

            Attribute
some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX>' enthusiasm to the novelty of their powers. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A decade</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ago</TIMEX>--before <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">penile</ENAMEX> injections--<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> thought of impotence as a psychological
problem or an unavoidable consequence of aging. (As the circulatory system
goes, so goes the reliability of erections. According to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Institutes</ENAMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Health</ENAMEX> report, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70 percent</NUMEX> of impotence cases among older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> can be traced
to cardiovascular problems.) With the advent of the new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medication</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX>
now had a cure in their bag, allowing them to shelve the psychological
explanations trumpeted by venerable sex <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gurus</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Masters</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alfred Kinsey</ENAMEX>, as well as the ancient belief that growing old means growing
soft. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goldstein</ENAMEX> epitomizes the new conventional wisdom: "[<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">I</ENAMEX>]<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mpotence</ENAMEX> is
basically a plumbing problem," he says. To fix it, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> needs to get under
the sink with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>, not into the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> with talk.

            Yet, in their haste and fervor to cure, urologists may have
debunked too many old assumptions about impotence and invested too much faith
in their new power to make <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> hard.

            Indeed, many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">impotents</ENAMEX> do
suffer from an exclusively medical problem. <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Diabetes</ENAMEX>, cardiovascular problems,
and penile injuries (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 100,000</NUMEX> whacked in bike accidents have been
permanently deflated, according to the medical literature) all prevent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> from
mustering a swelling. No amount of chat will ever restore their virility. A
stiff dose of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">prostaglandin</ENAMEX> for them, please.

            Still, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">prostaglandin</ENAMEX> is
an inadequate fix for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost half</NUMEX> of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX>. Caverject, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">prostaglandin</ENAMEX>
injection sold by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Upjohn</ENAMEX>, gets a rouse in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>, but <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40 percent</NUMEX> of
those who use it abandon the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> of beginning their therapy.
According to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Upjohn</ENAMEX>, the leading explanation offered by the quitters is that
the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> doesn't restore the sexual desire or the pleasure they once derived
from sex. In fact, some impotence <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> assert that the success rates of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">prostaglandin</ENAMEX> may not be much better than the success rates of placebos.

            What this indicates is that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">erections</ENAMEX>--satisfying erections--don't reside solely in the groin. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Natural</ENAMEX>
erections are elicited by the neural signaling of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nitric acid</ENAMEX>, which in turn is
triggered by some desire, or thought, or external stimuli. You can
short-circuit the biology of erection, but that doesn't "fix" the nonbiological
problems that exacerbate and sometimes even trigger impotence.

            The marginal efficacy of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">prostaglandin</ENAMEX> isn't likely to keep the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby boomers</ENAMEX> from buying the urological
spin. After all, their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cult</ENAMEX> of youth has successfully preached that aging can
be staved off by medical intervention: <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hair implants</ENAMEX>, skin <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">peels</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">liposuction</ENAMEX>. And by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>, which have been their remedy for every psychological
malady: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSD</ENAMEX> to shatter hang-ups; <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocaine</ENAMEX> to alleviate chronic boredom; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Prozac</ENAMEX>
to lift depression. Look for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">prostaglandin</ENAMEX> to become a sacrament that allows
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boomers</ENAMEX> to rut until death. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> that still listens to rock 'n' roll
will consider it their right to keep getting their rocks off.
