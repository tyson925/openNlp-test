            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinterngate</ENAMEX> entered its
baroque phase <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph diGenova</ENAMEX>, a prominent <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> who
has been one of the most incontinent television <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commentators</ENAMEX> on the scandal,
appeared on <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Meet The Press</ENAMEX> . In a tone of quivering outrage, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">diGenova</ENAMEX>
announced that he had received a tip from a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">diGenova</ENAMEX> and his
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Victoria Toensing</ENAMEX> (who is also his law <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partner</ENAMEX>), were the targets of a
private <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigator</ENAMEX> connected to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>.

            There is
no evidence for this. But it has now been widely reported--as an allegation by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">diGenova</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday and Monday</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike McCurry</ENAMEX> denied it.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Kendall</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Bennett</ENAMEX> issued a statement
saying that while <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Terry Lenzner</ENAMEX>, a professional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigator</ENAMEX>, was working with
them, "We have not investigated, and are not investigating, the personal lives
of Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Toensing</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">diGenova</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecutors</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the
press." DiGenova interprets the phrase "personal life" as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clintonian</ENAMEX> fancy
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">footwork</ENAMEX> and thus as confirmation of his charge. "The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> lied about it
on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX>, they lied about it <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX> and they lied about it <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX>,"
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">diGenova</ENAMEX> said in a telephone interview. "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike McCurry</ENAMEX> lied and he did it well.
That's his job. But the rest of us don't have to believe this crap."

            Why would the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> be investigating <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe diGenova</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Victoria Toensing</ENAMEX>? <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DiGenova</ENAMEX> says he is at a loss to explain, since he and his
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> have been "very fair" to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> in their scores of recent
appearances on programs including <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Rivera Live and Crossfire</ENAMEX> . TV
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bookers</ENAMEX> love <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">diGenova</ENAMEX> because he is a former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecutor</ENAMEX> who goes for the sound
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bite</ENAMEX>, and also because he is a former independent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counsel</ENAMEX> himself. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Between 1992</TIMEX>
and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>, he looked into charges that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> instigated
an improper search of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Clinton</ENAMEX>'s passport files during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1992</TIMEX> campaign.
(And largely exonerated the accused. Imagine how <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> would howl if a
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democratic</ENAMEX> independent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counsel</ENAMEX> let a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democratic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> off the hook.)
Though both <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">diGenova</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Toensing</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> who are hostile to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinton</ENAMEX>
and supportive of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth Starr</ENAMEX>, they usually argue against the
independent-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counsel</ENAMEX> law in general.

            But
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">diGenova</ENAMEX> is being disingenuous in pretending he has no idea why anyone would be
interested in him. If the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> has investigated <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">diGenova</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Toensing</ENAMEX>,
it might be because the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> seems to act as a conduit for leaks from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX> is using his subpoena power to investigate anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX> leaks from
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> camp. What would be so terrible if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clintonites</ENAMEX> were
investigating <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX>'s anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> leaks? Those leaks may be illegal and
violate the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>'s rights. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> have every justification for
trying to track them down.

            
If <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX> wanted to use an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intermediary</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">diGenova</ENAMEX> would be a good bet. He is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> of several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX>'s
staff and is especially close to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX>'s chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">deputy</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hickman Ewing</ENAMEX>, with whom
he served as a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> during the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DiGenova</ENAMEX> has
longstanding relationships with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX>, dating from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">his days</TIMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">District of Columbia</ENAMEX>. One could legitimately describe either
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">diGenova or Toensing</ENAMEX> as a "<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> knowledgeable about the
investigation," <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX>' favorite <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">leaker ID</ENAMEX>. There is no proof that either
has served as a cutout for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX>. But if they haven't, why do they qualify as a
"source" about anything? In fact, the unreliable gossip they sometimes pass on
makes the notorious <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matt Drudge</ENAMEX> look discreet.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> gets a glimpse of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vicky</ENAMEX>'s peculiar role in the fiasco that occurred in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late January</TIMEX>, when the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morning News</ENAMEX> reported, then retracted, then semi-reasserted that
a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Secret Service</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witness</ENAMEX> to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX> encounter was prepared to
testify. To recap: On <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the evening</TIMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Jan. 26</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> published a
report on its Web site. It quoted a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> "familiar with the negotiations" as
saying there was a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Secret Service</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> who had seen <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX> in a
"compromising situation" and that he had become a government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witness</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Hours</TIMEX>
later, the paper recanted: "the source for the story, a longtime <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> familiar with the case, later said the information provided for
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX>'s report was inaccurate." The paper further noted that, "The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">source</ENAMEX> is
not affiliated with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>." But <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the following day</TIMEX>, the paper
reissued a version of the story. An <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intermediary</ENAMEX> for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witness</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witnesses</ENAMEX> who
might or might not be a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Secret Service</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> had told <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX>'s office
about seeing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX> in what was now described as an "ambiguous
situation." Inexplicably, the story quoted "former <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Attorney</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">diGenova</ENAMEX>, who is not directly involved in the case," as saying that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">intermediary</ENAMEX> had made contact for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witness</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witnesses</ENAMEX> with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>. "In essence, your story is correct," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">diGenova</ENAMEX> told the paper.

            Was the
original <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> also <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">diGenova or Toensing</ENAMEX>? I think it must have been. Click to
find out why.

            Whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">diGenova</ENAMEX> was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">source</ENAMEX> or not, we do know
that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">diGenova</ENAMEX> spoke to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dallas Morning News</ENAMEX> on the record, confirming
that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witness</ENAMEX> of some sort did indirectly pass information to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>.
And we know that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Toensing</ENAMEX> spoke off the record, contradicting the originally
published version. Since <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">diGenova</ENAMEX> says they weren't representing anyone
involved, on what basis did they know? "This is a small <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Southern</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>," says
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">diGenova</ENAMEX>. "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> talk to a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. Reporters talk to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lawyers</ENAMEX>
talk. You hear things and you pass them on to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX> so that they might
investigate. Sometimes <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> don't investigate the way they should." This
sounds almost like an admission, and suggests that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> may be
indirectly using <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalists</ENAMEX> to try to substantiate rumors it has heard. In any
event, the fact that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dallas Morning News</ENAMEX> considered diGenova a
legitimate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> would suggest that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> thought he wasn't
just relating <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX>-hand gossip, but had real information from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>.

            All this
mischief is made much weirder by the fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">diGenova</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Toensing</ENAMEX> are
supposed to be presiding over a big investigation themselves. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter</ENAMEX>
Hoekstra, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R.</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mich.</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Committee on Education</ENAMEX> and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Workforce</ENAMEX> (formally <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Education</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Labor Committee</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">subcommittee</ENAMEX> on
investigations hired the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX> to investigate corruption in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Teamsters</ENAMEX> election, including allegations of involvement by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Democratic</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Committee</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX>, they signed a contract that pays them at the
rate of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$300,000</NUMEX> a year for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">80 hours</TIMEX> of work <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a month</TIMEX> each. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Committee Democrats</ENAMEX>
objected to this arrangement from the outset. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DiGenova</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Toensing</ENAMEX> are
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lobbyists</ENAMEX> registered on behalf of several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> including the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hospital Association</ENAMEX>. They may be called upon to lobby <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">legislators</ENAMEX> for whom
they also work as committee <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DiGenova</ENAMEX> says the problem is theoretical
and that he and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> have agreed not to lobby <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the committee
they're working for.

            
And there's more. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DiGenova</ENAMEX> also represents
another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committee</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan Burton</ENAMEX>, the goofish <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indiana</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Burton</ENAMEX>, too, is both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigator</ENAMEX> and investigatee. He has been looking into
the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> campaign-finance scandals. Meanwhile, he is being looked into for
allegedly putting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> on a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pakistani</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lobbyist</ENAMEX> for campaign
contributions.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX> complain that
given the amount of time they spend with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Geraldo</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">diGenova</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Toensing</ENAMEX> can't
possibly be doing their government job. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nexis</ENAMEX> search turns up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">368</NUMEX> hits for
the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first month</TIMEX> after the scandal broke. As of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few weeks ago</TIMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">committee</ENAMEX> had issued no subpoenas, interviewed no <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witnesses</ENAMEX>, and held no
hearings. (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DiGenova</ENAMEX> says it has since issued <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> subpoenas and has a hearing
scheduled for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late next month</TIMEX>.) <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX> have demanded to see time sheets; the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> have refused to show them. "We don't work for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX>," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">diGenova</ENAMEX>
says. "We work for the majority." He says that they do their congressional work
during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> and do media in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the evening</TIMEX>.

            But the
real problem with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">diGenova</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Toensing</ENAMEX> isn't their pundit addiction or their
neglect of an investigation that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX> would just as soon they neglect
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">anyhow</ENAMEX>. It's that their myriad, dubious, and overlapping roles keep piling up
without ever being properly explained. It's like one of those <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Westerns</ENAMEX> where
the town barber is also the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">postmaster</ENAMEX> and the saloonkeeper. In the next scene,
it turns out he's the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sheriff</ENAMEX> too.

            
               If you
missed the demonstration that either <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">diGenova or Toensing</ENAMEX> was the original
source for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dallas Morning News</ENAMEX> report about a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Secret Service</ENAMEX> agent
who witnessed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX> in a "compromising situation," click
