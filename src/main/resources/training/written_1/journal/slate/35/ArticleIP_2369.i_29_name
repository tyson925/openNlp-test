            <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>'s next <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> has
much in common with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>'s next <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prime minister</ENAMEX>. Both <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Clinton</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tony</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blair</ENAMEX> are comparatively young (and make a lot of it); suffused with energy and
conviction; and superbly effective on television, in front of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX>, or face
to face. The likeness goes deeper. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blair</ENAMEX> proclaim essentially the
same political philosophy, in essentially the same terms. They are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">champions</ENAMEX> of
a "new" left: reconciled to the central role of markets in the modern economy,
committed nonetheless to an active role for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>, keen to foster new
forms of social cooperation. The closeness is no accident. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blair</ENAMEX>, much the most
effective of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Labor</ENAMEX>'s recent modernizers, has modeled his electoral strategy, in
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substance</ENAMEX> and in style, on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s.

            Something else they have in
common is a reluctance to admit what this strategy implies. Both seem unaware
of the price they have paid for their electoral strength--namely that, far from
reviving the left, they have realigned it out of any meaningful existence. For
modern anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">conservatives</ENAMEX>, the price of success has been moral and intellectual
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">evisceration</ENAMEX>. In both the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>, where there was once a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coherent</ENAMEX> (albeit often unpopular) alternative to conservatism, there is now
merely a tepid version of the same, with added self-righteousness.

            
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Evidently</ENAMEX>, this is exactly what many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> want. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> campaign button
puts it nicely: "At least he cares." In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>, likewise, those who vote for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Labor</ENAMEX> in the forthcoming election may expect little to change when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blair</ENAMEX>
and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> come to power. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX>'s program consists largely of assurances
to that effect. But to say this misses the point. What matters is that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tories</ENAMEX> seem a callous lot, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tony Blair</ENAMEX> is a really nice chap.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blair</ENAMEX> don't appear to be faking it. What makes
them such exceptionally effective <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> is that they really do care. It
would be wrong to say they have cynically repackaged what they affect to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">deplore</ENAMEX>. They radiate genuine conviction. If <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blair</ENAMEX> seem
unaware of where their success leaves "liberalism" in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> or
"socialism" in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>, it is not because they are hiding something but because
they really are unaware. They are moderate <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">conservatives</ENAMEX> deluding themselves
that they are something else.

            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> would have been harder to dismiss as a conservative in denial. In his
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> presidential campaign he promised a lot, not the least of which was
radical reform of welfare and health care. Nothing came of it. The health-care
reform fell apart, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> recently signed a welfare-reform law that,
measured against what he <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> hoped to do, was a step in the wrong direction.
Despite these failures, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s presidency has been pretty successful. But
the main successes--curbing the budget deficit, presiding over steady growth
with low inflation, shrinking the government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">work force</ENAMEX>, passing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Free-Trade Agreement</ENAMEX>--are achievements of which any moderate
conservative could be proud. Unlike his failures, there is nothing very liberal
about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s successes.

            
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> has learned on the job. This time, his
campaign agenda is more modest, defined less by what he stands for than by what
he stands against (immoderate republicanism). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blair</ENAMEX>'s strategy is the same,
only more so. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Labor</ENAMEX> defines itself in opposition to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enemies</ENAMEX>: old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Labor</ENAMEX>
and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tories</ENAMEX>. Given the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Tory</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>'s unpopularity, the attack on old
Labor matters more. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blair</ENAMEX> therefore renounces the policies that he and his
parliamentary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> supported until recently. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Labor</ENAMEX> will not increase
taxes, will not increase public spending, will not renationalize the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">companies</ENAMEX>
privatized by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tories</ENAMEX>, will not restore trade-union power, and so on.

            Now that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Labor</ENAMEX>'s policies,
as far as one can tell, are all but identical to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Tories</ENAMEX>', <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blair</ENAMEX>'s attack on
the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enemy</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tories</ENAMEX> themselves, has to be handled with care. There is
a strand of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gingrich</ENAMEX> extremism in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> conservatism, but it is not yet
dominant, so assaulting it as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> has done in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> would serve little
electoral purpose. (This may change once the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Tories</ENAMEX> have lost the election.)
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blair</ENAMEX> cannot attack the substance of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Tory</ENAMEX> policies without attacking his own,
so he must attack the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>'s rhetoric instead. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Labor</ENAMEX> deplores the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tories</ENAMEX>' introduction of market forces within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Health Service</ENAMEX>, for
instance. Judging by their various policy documents, however, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Labor</ENAMEX> will not
reverse the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Tory</ENAMEX> reforms. Instead, where the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Tories</ENAMEX> talk of an "internal
market" (so conservative), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Labor</ENAMEX> promises "proper accountability to patients"
(absolutely <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Labor</ENAMEX>). On education, labor laws, and many other matters, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Labor</ENAMEX>
seeks far-reaching reform of vocabulary, while leaving policies by and large
unchanged.

            It's
worth noting that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Tories</ENAMEX>' "market" reforms (successfully portrayed by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> as capitalism-run-rampant) leave <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>'s health-care system far more
nationalized than <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>'s would have been under <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s plan (successfully
portrayed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> as a "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> takeover"). In other words, the political
spectrums of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> are, to some extent, different. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blair</ENAMEX>'s political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journeys</ENAMEX> remain similar. In particular, to make good the
lack of new left-of-center policies (which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> appear not to want), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinton</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blair</ENAMEX> have pumped up the consoling left-of-center symbolism (which is still
much in demand). In both cases, this comes in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> main forms:

            <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX> is the apologetic mode. As decent left-of-center
types, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blair</ENAMEX> implicitly say, "We would love to do all the things
that left-of-center <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> used to do--but we can't, because the world has
changed." Capital markets, globalization, information superhighways, and
whatnot compel us to modernize our policies, keep taxes and public spending
low, pay attention to the needs of business, and so on.

            Then comes
the bright, forward-looking, seizing-of-opportunities mode. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s campaign
proclaims a new "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Age of Possibility" for America</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blair</ENAMEX> has just published a
volume of speeches and articles titled <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">New</ENAMEX> 
               <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> : My

               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vision</ENAMEX> 
               of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Young</ENAMEX> 
               <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">Country</ENAMEX> . As <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> of the future, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinton</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blair</ENAMEX> say they transcend traditional left-right categories. Old labels and
the conflicts they represent have become hopelessly outmoded. The tensions
between, say, competition and compassion, or efficiency and equity, which
blighted politics for so long, are sterile quarrels of yesteryear.

            
There is little <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substance</ENAMEX> in any of this. Yes,
the world has changed. It keeps doing that. But only in small respects have
developments in technology and the global economy narrowed choices over policy.
What really has changed is that many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> in many <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> have decided that
traditional left-of-center policies (e.g., higher taxes, more generous
provisions for the poor) are not what they want. Many also wish to be spared
any guilt that might arise on that account--which is why <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blair</ENAMEX> are
on to such a good thing with, "We'd love to do that, but it's no longer
feasible." What about new politics, transcended categories, and all that? In
the future, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blair</ENAMEX> say, false oppositions between competition and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">compassion</ENAMEX>, efficiency and equity, will be resolved. That would be good, but
how is it to be done? Simply by saying, again and again, "We must have
competition with compassion, efficiency with equity." If only this had been
understood before, we could all have become <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conservatives</ENAMEX> much sooner.

            The
clearest proof of the new left's poverty is what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blair</ENAMEX> have to say
about the "middle class." In both <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>, the term covers nearly
everybody. In the age of possibility that beckons, one thing that apparently
will not be possible is a policy that imposes a fiscal burden on this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>.
Not content to rule out policies (however worthy) that impose a cost on most
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blair</ENAMEX> often go further, saying that their main fiscal
goal is to improve the position of the middle class. Since "the rich" are a
tiny proportion of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers</ENAMEX>, the only thing this could mean in practice would
be an improvement relative to the position of the poor--an extraordinary idea
for supposedly left-of-center <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX>, however modern or forward-looking, to
adopt.

            Any party expecting its program to be taken seriously as a
left-of-center alternative to conservatism must surely propose one of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
things: Either it must promise to increase in the aggregate the quantity and
quality of public services (and the taxes needed to pay for them), or else it
must promise, within an unchanged total of taxes and spending, to redirect the
flow of resources so that the less well-off get more. In either case, stripped
to its essentials, a left-of-center <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">program</ENAMEX> seeks to help the less prosperous
at the expense of everybody else (i.e., at the expense of the middle
class).

            It may well be, as
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conservatives</ENAMEX> would argue, that policies of this kind are a bad idea for one
reason or another. Perhaps they would fail. Conceivably, they would fail so
badly that they would even make the intended <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">beneficiaries</ENAMEX> worse off. This is
exactly the argument that the left should be having with the right, just as in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the old days</TIMEX>. For the moment, most strikingly in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>, the left
has simply capitulated. In order to win power, it promises to make no
difference. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blair</ENAMEX> won't do anything a conservative wouldn't. But at
least they care.
