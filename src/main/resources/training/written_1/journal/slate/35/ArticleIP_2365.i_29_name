            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">This year</TIMEX> of elections is
almost enough to make one give up on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">democracy</ENAMEX>--or at least on the idea that
democracies are inherently more committed to peace than other forms of
government.

            The
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israeli</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief of state</ENAMEX>, who was totally committed to the peace process, was
defeated by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> who openly played on <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israeli</ENAMEX> fears of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Palestinians</ENAMEX>. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">victor</ENAMEX>'s idea of peace-through-strength may make peace highly problematic.

            In
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX>, a majority of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">electorate</ENAMEX> voted for openly nationalistic--even
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">imperialistic</ENAMEX>--<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> round. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boris Yeltsin</ENAMEX> won the second
round only by recruiting <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander Lebed</ENAMEX>, a retired <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">general</ENAMEX> with frightful
views on <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> and other religious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minorities</ENAMEX>.

            And in
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bosnia</ENAMEX>, the mere discussion of elections has exacerbated ethnic tensions,
allowing the most virulent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nationalists</ENAMEX> to gain support, and led to predictions
that this democratic procedure could finish the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>.

            What is
going on? Why is this most cherished belief not being borne out by events?
Could it even be that under certain circumstances, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">democracies</ENAMEX> might be
more warlike than other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>? If so, what does that portend for us and
our search for a more peaceful world?

            The idea that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">democracies</ENAMEX> are the most peaceful political
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX> is attractive and plausible, but there is little evidence to support
the notion: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Fewer than a dozen</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> have been continuously democratic over
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past century</TIMEX>--not an especially large sample--and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> of them, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>
and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, share a common border. Many of these <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">democracies</ENAMEX> have
gone to war, and not always in response to attack.

            Still worse,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">democracies</ENAMEX>--or at least the electoral <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">systems</ENAMEX> at their core--have produced
monsters, some of them committed to waging war. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> thinks of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hitler</ENAMEX>'s
exploitation of the electoral system in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>, but one can see similar, if
smaller, figures in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Serbia</ENAMEX> and elsewhere.

            In the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> emerging from the former <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Soviet Union</ENAMEX>, aggressive nationalism has
been a winning formula for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> who can deliver little else to their
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>--not just <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lebed</ENAMEX>, but <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Serbian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Slobodan Milosevic</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Armenia</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Levon Ter-Petrosyan</ENAMEX>, and others as well.

            It's tempting to view these examples as transitional. Both
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Yugoslav</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">systems</ENAMEX> were based on the cynical exploitation of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ethnicity</ENAMEX>, so it's only natural that succeeding systems continue the tradition.
One could argue that the cure for despotism is democracy itself. But that begs
the question of why <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">democracies</ENAMEX>, and often more established ones, have been
less than peaceful.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West</ENAMEX>'s belief in
"peaceful democracy" endures, in part, because it celebrates us, because we
think that the spread of democracy will usher in a period of peace that will
allow us to concentrate on our own needs and ignore those of others. Our
conviction reflects a widespread belief that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are basically good and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pacific</ENAMEX>, while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> are fundamentally <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">suspect</ENAMEX> and aggressive.

            If our
cherished belief isn't correct, the reverse may be true--that under certain
conditions, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">democracies</ENAMEX> might be even more given to warlike behavior than other
forms of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Totalitarianism</ENAMEX> kept ethnic hatreds in check in many
places, especially <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eastern Europe</ENAMEX> and the former <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Soviet Union</ENAMEX>. Now that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Communist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">totalitarians</ENAMEX> have been replaced by nominal <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">democrats</ENAMEX>, murderous
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hatreds</ENAMEX> and regional conflicts have re-emerged.

            While it's probably true that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">democracies</ENAMEX> are unlikely to
go to war unless they're attacked, sometimes they are the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> to take the
offensive. And once involved in a conflict, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">democracies</ENAMEX> may actually be less
willing than authoritarian regimes to end it short of "total victory." These
views may make conflicts longer and more bloody than they would otherwise
be.

            While authoritarian
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">regimes</ENAMEX> can make war without the consent of the governed--as any number of
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">democratic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enthusiasts</ENAMEX> have pointed out--they can also make peace without
consulting the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX>. Indeed, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">democracies</ENAMEX> that take too many risks for peace
may not win popular support, as the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israeli</ENAMEX> elections show.

            Nor
does democratization change the underlying reality of international relations:
geography. With the possible exception of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> do not move around
very much, and thus their geopolitical concerns and the conflicts arising from
them do not change very much. The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last decade</TIMEX> has seen the triumphant return of
geography in international relations and the enshrinement on the world scene of
the old <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> political principle that "where you stand depends on where you
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sit</ENAMEX>."

            <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX>'s interest in gaining access to warm-water <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ports</ENAMEX> did
not arise under communism--nor has it now disappeared. We can hope that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moscow</ENAMEX>
will seek different means of advancing its interests differently than it has in
the past, but democracy by itself won't repeal these pressures. In fact, the
disintegration of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX> has recreated the geographic relationship
between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moscow</ENAMEX> that was the seedbed of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War I and World War</ENAMEX>
II.

            These
observations don't mean that we should withdraw our support for democracy in
the former <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">bloc</ENAMEX>. Democracy has done a great deal for all those who have
experienced it, but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">democracy</ENAMEX> alone is not enough. Transforming those nations
into peaceful <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the international <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> will require more than just a
few elections and economic reform. As the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Founders</ENAMEX> knew, the rule of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> can be dangerous unless constrained by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> institutions
and constitutionalism. Only if these additional arrangements exist can these
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>--or our own--avoid disaster.

            We seem to have lost sight of the fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">democracy</ENAMEX> is as
much about procedures as about preferred outcomes, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">excusing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boris Yeltsin</ENAMEX>'s use
of tanks against his own <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parliament</ENAMEX> and his dispatch of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chechnya</ENAMEX> a
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year later</TIMEX>. This has made many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in the region, who are still learning
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about</TIMEX> democracy, cynical about what the system means. And it has undercut our
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">authority</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">democracy</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">backers</ENAMEX>.

            Democracy by itself won't
solve all international problems; it won't relieve us--in Aleksandr
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Solzhenitsyn</ENAMEX>'s phrase--"of having to worry about defending ourselves." Instead,
we must work even harder to integrate these <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> into the West and into
the values that have brought peace, prosperity, and freedom to so many people
here.

            That won't be easy. Many
will grow discouraged, especially in the short term, as more open politics in
the former <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> bloc lead not to peace, but to more conflicts. But we
shouldn't blame <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">democracy</ENAMEX>; we should only understand what it can and can't
do.
