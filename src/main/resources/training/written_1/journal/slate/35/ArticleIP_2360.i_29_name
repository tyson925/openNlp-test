            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">About 130 years ago</TIMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">England</ENAMEX>, an unlikely <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">coalition</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">feminists</ENAMEX>, trade <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">unionists</ENAMEX>, and clergymen
transformed the sexual mores of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">alliance</ENAMEX> began progressively
enough, as a campaign against a law authorizing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> to round up
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prostitutes</ENAMEX>--and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> suspected of loose morals--and force them to
submit to pelvic exams. The law was repealed. Thrilled at their newfound clout,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">feminists</ENAMEX> looked around for another issue.

            They
found it in white slavery, or "traffic in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>." The cry went out. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newspapers</ENAMEX>
took it up, running story after story about <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">virgins</ENAMEX> sold to drooling
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aristocrats</ENAMEX>. New laws were passed. The "social-purity" movement was born.

            Things spun quickly out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">feminists</ENAMEX>' control. Whipped
into a frenzy, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> formed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Vigilance Association</ENAMEX>, but rather
than protecting impoverished <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">virgins</ENAMEX> the vigilantes conducted a crusade against
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">prostitutes</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homosexuals</ENAMEX>, music <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">halls</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">theaters</ENAMEX>, paintings of nudes, and French
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">novels</ENAMEX> (which they burned). At first, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">feminists</ENAMEX> joined in the fun. But when the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">misogyny</ENAMEX> and terror of the social-purity movement became impossible to ignore,
they withdrew into the background. Which is where they remained for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next 20</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, discredited and humiliated, until the next wave of feminist activism
came around.

            Feminist
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">historian Judith Walkowitz</ENAMEX> published an essay about this incident back in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1983</TIMEX>,
during the height of feminist anti-pornography fervor. She wanted to show what
can happen when feminism joins forces with the public-decency <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX>. Now what
can happen has happened. The social-purity movement that is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> sex
scandal has at least some of its roots in feminist thought, and the embarrassed
mumbles of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gloria Steinem, et al.</ENAMEX>, on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX> question show that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">feminists</ENAMEX>
know it. For instance: Why were <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paula Jones</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> able to depose <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> on
every sordid detail of his sex life? Because of sexual harassment laws that say
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>'s entire sexual past may be considered relevant in a lawsuit, even though
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>'s may not. This arrangement was one of the triumphs of feminism over
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past two decades</TIMEX>.

            
Like its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19 th century</TIMEX> counterpart,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">movement</ENAMEX> will be forced to retreat from the field, confused and in
disarray, if it doesn't come to terms with its mistakes. The biggest <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> (as
many have pointed out) was blindly following the lead of that most illiberal of
thinkers, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Catherine MacKinnon</ENAMEX>. With her belief that unwanted sexual advances
and utterances (and even, in some cases, wanted ones) degrade <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> so
profoundly that it's worth limiting free speech to prevent them, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">MacKinnon</ENAMEX> laid
the intellectual groundwork for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s sexual harassment laws. Before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>,
the most egregious outcome of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MacKinnonism</ENAMEX> was the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarence Thomas</ENAMEX> hearings.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Liberal feminists</ENAMEX> (myself included, I'm sorry to say) were so eager to "educate
the public" about sexual harassment, to say nothing of wanting to get rid of an
anti-abortion <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX>, that they were willing to overlook the
frightening precedent being set. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>'s political career was nearly ended and
his private life pawed through while an entire <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> watched, even though the
charges against him were never subjected to the rigorous standards of evidence
that would have prevailed in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> of law.

            Back in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s and 1970s</TIMEX>, before feminism came to mean anti-pornography statutes and
laws against "hostile work environments" and other forms of censoriousness,
there were all kinds of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">feminists</ENAMEX>. There were the liberal kind, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Betty</ENAMEX>
Friedan, who believed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Equal Rights Amendment</ENAMEX>, day care, birth control,
and abortion. There were the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">libertarian kind</ENAMEX>, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walkowitz</ENAMEX>, who argued
for sexual freedom, no matter how troublesome the consequences. (There were
also <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">feminists</ENAMEX> who just seem goofy in retrospect, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>'s-music types
and flannel-wearing lesbian <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">separatists</ENAMEX>.)

            The healthy diversity of feminist life was killed off by
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> things: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 1970s</TIMEX>, after the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Equal Rights Amendment</ENAMEX> failed to
pass, the women's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">movement</ENAMEX> deliberately switched from the political arena to
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX>. A legal strategy for change had worked for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thurgood Marshall</ENAMEX> of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NAACP Legal Defense Fund</ENAMEX>, so why not? The answer is as true for women's rights
as it has been for civil rights: A movement always suffers when it fails to
subject its ideas to wide public debate. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) Influenced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MacKinnon</ENAMEX> and others,
what the women's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">movement</ENAMEX> decided to seek in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX> was equal protection
plus : the right to work plus special protection against nasty
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in the workplace; the right to make their own sexual decisions
plus special protection against older, savvier <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> who take advantage.
But rights are not necessarily cost-free. A relentless expansion of my rights
usually ends up imposing burdens on your rights, or even on other rights of my
own. The fury that followed some of the more questionable expansions of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>'s
rights has made it difficult to talk about anything else.

            During a
debate on feminism, the philosopher <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hannah Arendt</ENAMEX> once passed a note to a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleague</ENAMEX> that said, "What do we lose when we win?" It was the sort of dour
remark that made <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arendt</ENAMEX> unpopular among her female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peers</ENAMEX>. That's a shame,
because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arendt</ENAMEX>'s thought offers a way out of feminism's current <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">jam</ENAMEX>. She stood
for the clear separation of the public from the private sphere, a distinction
dismissed as patriarchal <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a long time ago</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">feminists</ENAMEX> who thought it denigrated
domestic life. But failing to see the importance of this distinction has got
feminism into the trouble it's in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>.

            
To <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arendt</ENAMEX>, the elimination of the
public-private distinction is what distinguishes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">th century</ENAMEX>
totalitarianism from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> and lesser forms of oppression. Even in the days
of absolute monarchs, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> was his (or, to a lesser degree, her)
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">castle</ENAMEX>. But totalitarian <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> want to control your private life down to
your psyche and to mold you into a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">New Man or New Woman</ENAMEX> on whatever model
they're peddling.

            Conversely, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arendt</ENAMEX>'s public
realm is the exact opposite of the private realm: It's where you're not
protected and shouldn't be. A classicist, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arendt</ENAMEX> saw the public <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">arena</ENAMEX> as a
version of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Athenian</ENAMEX> agora--a world of political <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">theater</ENAMEX>, where the harsh
light of publicity shines upon fierce debate. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arendt</ENAMEX>'s conception of the public
was phrased in quasimilitaristic language almost expressly designed to irritate
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">feminists</ENAMEX> (it didn't, but only because they had stopped listening). She
declared that, for the public realm to function effectively, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> must
display a love of glory. It is a hunger for glory and all that comes with it--a
willingness to sacrifice one's personal desires to the common good; a sense of
honor, dignity, and fair play--that allows politics to rise above a mere
squabbling among interests. This is a spirit feminism lacks, which is why it
has allowed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>'s interests as a class to trump the common interest in
privacy.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rediscovering Arendt</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">public-private</ENAMEX> split wouldn't necessarily entail abandoning the feminist notion
that the personal is political. We're all better off because <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">feminists</ENAMEX> turned
hitherto private topics into <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> of public debate. Who'd want to go back
to the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> when you couldn't even talk about condoms? The problem is that
we've reversed the phrase: We've made the political personal. It's one thing to
put sensitive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> out there for discussion. It's another thing to welcome
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">jurists</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX>, and the rest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> into our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedrooms</ENAMEX>. As
it turns out, it may not be such a good idea to welcome them into our
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">workplaces</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> either, at least not as warmly as we have. So should we
do away with all forms of sexual harassment law? Or just parts of it--the
hostile work environment clause, say, or the gender-biased evidentiary rules?
It will take <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> to find the best place to draw the line, and we'll never get
it perfectly right. The important thing is to realize that it's way past time
to move it.
