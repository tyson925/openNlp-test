            Perhaps because we are
nearing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of a millennium</TIMEX>, there seems to be a renewal of interest in
theories of history. We seek regularities in the long movements of history,
trying to find our place in a bigger picture than <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the evening</TIMEX> news and hoping
to see what is coming next.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> kinds of theories of
history have been prominent in recent discussion--ending theories, wave
theories, and cycle theories.

            The ending theories identify
ages with distinguishing features that have come to an end or will come to an
end and will not recur. The distinguishing features may be dominance by one
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nation</ENAMEX>, the prevalence of a particular social system, or the pervasiveness of a
certain technology. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roman Empire</ENAMEX> came to an end, feudalism came to an end,
and some say that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Industrial Age</ENAMEX> is coming to an end. These periods will
not come back. There may or may not be common features that bring ages to an
end. There may or may not be a predictable sequence of ages, as in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Marxist</ENAMEX>
theory that feudalism leads to capitalism and capitalism leads to socialism--a
theory that, so far, seems to have been erroneous.

            The most ambitious of the
recent ending theories is the theory of the end of history, advanced by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fukuyama</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>.

            Wave theories postulate the
recurrence of phases with similar characteristics. Thus, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">History goes A-B</ENAMEX>, A-B
or A-B-C, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A-B-C.</ENAMEX> All the As have similar features that distinguish them from
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bs or Cs</ENAMEX>. But the As may be of quite different lengths from each other, and
so may the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bs and Cs</ENAMEX>, and they may have their distinguishing features to
different degrees. A recent wave theory is that propounded by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Hackett</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fisher</ENAMEX>. He finds in history long waves of inflation, each followed by a crisis
followed by a period of equilibrium followed by another wave of inflation, and
so on.

            Cycle theories, unlike wave
theories, suggest that the phases of history are of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">roughly</NUMEX> similar duration.
That permits prediction of the remaining duration of the present phase and the
coming of the next phase. A simple historical cycle consists of alternating
phases of political activism followed by political passivity. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arthur</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schlesinger Jr.</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>, is the leading exponent of this idea,
which was first put forward by his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>.

            A more complex cycle is
described by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">co-authors</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Strauss</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neil Howe</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">panelists</ENAMEX>.
They visualize a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-phase cycle. These phases are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) an era of strengthening
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) an era of spiritual awakening, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) an era of weakening
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) an era of crisis. The entire <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-phase cycle is believed
to last <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about 80 years</TIMEX>.

            Our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> to discuss the
validity and implications of these and other theories of history will consist
of the aforementioned Messrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fukuyama</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schlesinger</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Strauss</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howe</ENAMEX>; and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Professor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Modelski</ENAMEX>, of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Washington</ENAMEX>.
