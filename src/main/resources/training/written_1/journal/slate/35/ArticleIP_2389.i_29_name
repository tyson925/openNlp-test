            Does welfare spawn
out-of-wedlock <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">babies</ENAMEX>? The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architects</ENAMEX> of the recently passed welfare reform
believe it does. They hope that curbing payments for additional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and
enforcing parental work requirements will reverse the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25-year</TIMEX> trend that has
brought large numbers of unmarried <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> onto the welfare rolls.

            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1965</TIMEX>,
<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">24 percent</NUMEX> of black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.1 percent</NUMEX> of white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> were born to
single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX>. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX>, the rates had risen to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">64 percent</NUMEX> for black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX>
and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">18 percent</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Every year</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 1 million</NUMEX> more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> are born
into fatherless <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>, at an enormously increased risk of growing up in
poverty.

            Efforts by social <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> to explain the rise in
out-of-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">wedlock</NUMEX> births have been unconvincing. Conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Murray</ENAMEX>, for
example, blames overly generous federal welfare benefits. But as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Ellwood</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawrence Summers</ENAMEX> have shown, cash welfare benefits rose sharply in the
1960s and fell in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1970s and 1980s</TIMEX>, when out-of-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">wedlock</NUMEX> births rose
most.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Liberals</ENAMEX>
have tended to favor the explanation offered by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Julius Wilson</ENAMEX>, who, in
a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</TIMEX> study, attributed the increase in out-of-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">wedlock</NUMEX> births to a decline in
the marriageability of black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>, due to a shortage of jobs. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert D. Mare</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher Winship</ENAMEX> have estimated that at most <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 percent</NUMEX> of the decline
in marriage rates of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1960 and 1980</TIMEX> can be explained by
decreasing employment.

            
Abetter theory might be called "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reproductive</ENAMEX>
Technology Shock." In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 1960s</TIMEX> and very <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 1970s</TIMEX> (well before <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Roe</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">vs. Wade</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 1973</TIMEX>), the availability of both abortion and
contraception increased dramatically. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>, liberalized their abortion laws. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 1970</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Massachusetts</ENAMEX>
law prohibiting the distribution of contraceptives to unmarried <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> was
declared unconstitutional. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observers</ENAMEX> expected liberalized abortion and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">contraception</ENAMEX> to lead to fewer out-of-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">wedlock</NUMEX> births. But the opposite
happened, because of the decline in the custom of "<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">shotgun weddings</ENAMEX>."

            Before
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1970</TIMEX>, the stigma of unwed motherhood was so great that most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> would only
engage in sexual activity if it came with a promise of marriage in the event of
pregnancy. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Men</ENAMEX> were willing to make (and keep) that promise, for they knew that
even if they left <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>, they would be unlikely to find another who would
not make the same demand. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1970s</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> who were willing to get an
abortion, or who used contraception reliably, no longer found it necessary to
condition sexual relations on a promise of marriage in the event of pregnancy.
But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> who found abortion unacceptable, or who were unreliable in their
contraceptive use, found themselves pressured to participate in premarital
sexual relations as well. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> feared, correctly, that if they refused
sexual relations, they would risk losing their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partners</ENAMEX>.

            By making the birth of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> the physical choice
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>, the sexual revolution has made marriage and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> support a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">social</ENAMEX> choice of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>. And while only a few unmarried <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> once
kept their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">babies</ENAMEX>, only a few put them up for adoption <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, because the
stigma of unwed motherhood has declined. Once shunned by their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peers</ENAMEX> and
whisked out of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, pregnant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teen-agers</ENAMEX> now receive both encouragement and
support to keep their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">babies</ENAMEX>, stay in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>, and participate in other social
activities.

            Although
doubt will always remain about what causes a change in social custom, the
technology-shock theory does fit the facts. The new reproductive technology was
adopted quickly, and on a massive scale. Marital and fertility patterns changed
with similar drama, at about the same time.

            
The use of birth-control <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pills</ENAMEX> at first
intercourse by all unmarried <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> jumped from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6 percent to 15 percent</NUMEX> in just
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few years</TIMEX>, and probably much more among sexually active unmarried <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. The
number of abortions among unmarried <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> grew from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">roughly 100,000</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> in
the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late 1960s</TIMEX> (compared with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 322,000</NUMEX> out-of-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">wedlock</NUMEX> births) to more than
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.2 million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> (compared with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">715,000</NUMEX> out-of-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">wedlock</NUMEX> births) in the early
1980s. During the same period, births per unmarried <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> roughly doubled for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX>, while the fraction of white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">unmarried women</ENAMEX> rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 30 percent</NUMEX>. For
black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">unmarried women</ENAMEX>, the birth rate actually fell by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">between 5 percent</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
percent, but this was offset by an increase of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 40 percent</NUMEX> in the number
of unmarried black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. Meanwhile, fertility rates for married <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> of both
races declined rapidly, making the out-of-wedlock birth ratio even larger.

            The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">shotgun</ENAMEX>-marriage rate itself declined only gradually, but that is not
surprising. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social</ENAMEX> conventions change slowly. It took time for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> to recognize
that they did not have to promise marriage in the event of a pregnancy in
exchange for sexual relations. It may also have taken time for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> to
perceive the increased willingness of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> to leave them if they demanded
marriage.

            One final puzzle, however, requires explanation. The black
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">shotgun</ENAMEX>-marriage ratio began to fall earlier than the white ratio and shows no
significant change in trend around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1970</TIMEX>. Here, federal welfare benefits may
play a role. Because <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX>, on average, have lower incomes than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX>, they
are more affected by changes in welfare benefits. As a result, the rise in
welfare benefits in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s</TIMEX> may have resulted in a decline in the black
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">shotgun</ENAMEX>-marriage rate, and thus, in an increase in out-of-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">wedlock</NUMEX> births.

            What should be done? Even if
possible, attempts to turn back the technological clock by restricting abortion
and contraception would now be counterproductive. Besides denying reproductive
freedom to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, such efforts would increase the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> born and
reared in impoverished <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">single-parent families</ENAMEX>. Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> born out of
wedlock are reported by their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> to have been "wanted," but "not at that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>." Some are reported as not having been wanted at all. Easier access to
birth-control information and devices and to abortion could reduce the number
of unwanted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and improve the timing of those whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> would have
preferred to wait.
