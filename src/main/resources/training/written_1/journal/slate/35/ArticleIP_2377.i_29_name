            Why the human race keeps
getting faster.

<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday, July 4</TIMEX>; to be composted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday, July 11</TIMEX> )

            On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 6, 1954</TIMEX>, at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxford</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Iffley</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Road track</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger Bannister</ENAMEX> became, by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">just half a second</TIMEX>,
the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> to run a mile in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">less than four minutes</TIMEX>. The Holy Grail of
middle-distance running was his. <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Forty</NUMEX>-<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years later</TIMEX>, however, that
achievement seems less significant. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX><NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">-minute miles</NUMEX> are commonplace; the
current record, held by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Algerian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noureddine Morceli</ENAMEX>, is <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3:44</TIMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 5</NUMEX>
percent faster than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bannister</ENAMEX>'s speed. What <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iffley Road</ENAMEX> witnessed was just
another step along the road to an ever quicker mile, part of the inexorable
improvement of athletic performance that we usually take for granted,
particularly when the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Olympics</ENAMEX> roll around. If you stop to think about it,
though, such constant progress is remarkable. After all, as biomechanical
machines with a standard set of parts, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> should be subject to the same
limitations we see in, say, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">automobiles</ENAMEX>. How come they aren't?

            A lot
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">entrepreneurs</ENAMEX> and technophiles would like us to think that the answer has to
do with discoveries in the world of sports technology. A new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nike</ENAMEX> shoe is
trumpeted as something that will shave <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX>-thousandth of a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> off
your <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100-meter</NUMEX> time. Trainers measure the rate of buildup of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lactic acid</ENAMEX> in
your muscles, then claim that their programs will control it. Nutritionists
fine-tune <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">athletes</ENAMEX>' diets. Even the old sexual-abstinence-before-the-race dogma
is being re-evaluated under the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all</NUMEX>-seeing eye of science. But I consider all
this little more than tinkering. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sports</ENAMEX> records would continue to tumble even
if training methods or athletic clothing or sexual practices were exactly the
same <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> as they were in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1896</TIMEX>, when the first modern <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Olympics</ENAMEX> took place.
These minor miracles are the product neither of technology nor of training but
of demographic patterns that affect us all.

            Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past century</TIMEX>, the human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">race</ENAMEX> has been affected by
a slew of what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">demographers</ENAMEX> call "secular" trends. (In this context, "secular"
does not refer to a trend's lack of spirituality but to its longevity: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Secular</ENAMEX>
trends are long-term modifications, not just brief fluctuations.) One such
trend is an increase in average size. You have to stoop to get through the
doorways of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tudor</ENAMEX> cottage in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX> because its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhabitants</ENAMEX> were smaller
than you are, not because they had a penchant for crouching. Another trend is
in life expectancy. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> are living longer. Life expectancy in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX>
increased over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past 20 years from 46 to 53 years</TIMEX>. Over the same period in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, where things were already pretty comfortable to begin with, life
expectancy increased from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">71 to 75 years</TIMEX>. The global average was an increase
from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">58 to 65 years</TIMEX>.

            
Probably the most striking change, though, is how much more quickly children
are maturing. A <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX> who was in what the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Health</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Organization</ENAMEX> calls "average economic circumstances" was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 9 inches</NUMEX> taller
than his or her <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1900</TIMEX> counterpart. This is not solely the product of the first
trend--the increase in average size--but also due to the fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
develop faster. Girls menstruate earlier than they used to. The age of menarche
(the onset of menstruation) has decreased by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three or four months</TIMEX> per <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decade</TIMEX> in
average sections of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Western European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past 150 years</TIMEX>. There
is a good chance that our <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990 12-year-old</TIMEX> already had started to menstruate.
Her <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1900</TIMEX> counterpart would still have had <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three years</TIMEX> to wait.

            What do such trends have to do with athletic performance?
Well, if we're living longer and growing up faster, that must mean we're
producing bigger, better <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX>. Better bodies imply faster miles. We run
faster and faster for the same reason it is now common for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">menstruate</ENAMEX>. But why are these things happening?

            
Demographers have offered a variety of explanations, but the main one is that
our diet is improving. A <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12-year-old</TIMEX> ate better in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX> than she would have in
the Victorian <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">era</TIMEX>. This conclusion is supported by studies of the social <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elite</ENAMEX>:
Because its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> were well-nourished even in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early years</TIMEX> of this
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">century</ENAMEX>, this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> has experienced relatively little change, over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past 100</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, in the age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> first menstruate. Another explanation is that health
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">care</ENAMEX> is getting better. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX>, according to the WHO, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 75 percent</NUMEX> of
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all 1-year-olds</TIMEX> worldwide were immunized against a range of common <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smallpox</ENAMEX>, that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scourge</ENAMEX> of previous generations, now is effectively extinct.
Probably the best measure of how much healthier we are is the rate of infant
mortality, which measures both the health of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> (a sickly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> is
more likely to produce a sickly baby) and the health of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX>. In the past
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20 years</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infant</ENAMEX> mortality around the world has dropped from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">92</NUMEX> deaths per <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX>
live births to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">just 62</NUMEX>. A lot of this can be chalked up to primary-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">heath</NUMEX>-care
programs in the developing world--the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> average, for instance, has
dropped from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">135</NUMEX> deaths per <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1000</NUMEX> births to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">95</NUMEX>. But there are also significant
improvements in the developed world, with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infant</ENAMEX> deaths dropping in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> over
the same <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20-year period</TIMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">24</NUMEX> per <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX> live births to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">just 10</NUMEX>.

            Better health care affects athletic ability directly. This
is true in the trivial case in which, say, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">antibiotics</ENAMEX> cure a runner's fever
before the big race, but it may also be true in a more significant way.
Diseases contracted in early infancy can have a lifetime impact on health--not
necessarily a big one, but an impact nevertheless. Previous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX> bore
scars from all sorts of non-life-threatening diseases, the stuff everyone
picked up as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nowadays</ENAMEX>, though, more and more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> grow up with no
history of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>. Since top <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">athletes</ENAMEX> inevitably are drawn from the healthiest
sector of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, a generally superior system of health care means a
bigger pool of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to draw from. You are much more likely to find someone
who can run a mile in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3:30</TIMEX> in a sample of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">several million</NUMEX> superbly healthy
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> than you are in a sample of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX>.

            The
<ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">pool</ENAMEX> of potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">athletes</ENAMEX> has expanded in other ways, too. First, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">population</ENAMEX> has exploded. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, we are coming ever closer to a worldwide
middle <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> from which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">athletes</ENAMEX> typically are drawn. Whether, in an
age of multinational capitalism, we may talk reasonably about a post-colonial
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">era</ENAMEX> is way beyond the scope of this article. The fact remains, however, that
the developing world is doing just that--developing. Even <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mozambique</ENAMEX>, which
ranks at, or near, the bottom of national per capita gross national product
tables, has shown an increase of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">some 20 percent</NUMEX> in adult literacy rates over
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past 20 years</TIMEX>. Literacy rates are merely an index of education, which
itself is another way of talking about a global move away from a hand-to-mouth
lifestyle.

            The decline of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX> has its <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Olympic</ENAMEX> corollaries. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">won</ENAMEX>, on average, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> gold medals per Olympics in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> games held in
its imperial heyday before <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">I.</ENAMEX> That average has dropped to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only five</NUMEX>
medals per Olympics in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> held since. This is not a reflection of declining
athletic standards in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>, however; it's a function of how much more
competitive other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nations</ENAMEX> have become. The <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Olympics</ENAMEX> originally were the
preserve of the socioeconomic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elite</ENAMEX> of the socioeconomic elite among <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nations</ENAMEX>.
Consider this: Only <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nations</ENAMEX> participated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1896</TIMEX>, but there were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">172</NUMEX> in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX>. Black <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Africans</ENAMEX> didn't take part until the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> modern games, held in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1908</TIMEX>. Even this was accidental: <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Lentauw and Yamasami, Zulu</ENAMEX> tribesmen,
entered the marathon because they happened to be in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. Louis</ENAMEX> as part of an
exhibit about the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Boer war</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lentauw</ENAMEX> finished <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">ninth</NUMEX> despite being chased into a
cornfield by <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX>.

            Since
all these are changes in how we live, not anything innate, we have to conclude
that what we are describing here are effects of environment, not genes. Let us
assume that our <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1900 and 1990 12-year-olds</TIMEX> are identical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">twins</ENAMEX> magically born
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">90 years</TIMEX> apart. The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> still will grow up faster, end up bigger,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">menstruate</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX>, and live longer than the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1900</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX>. Perhaps way, way back
in human history, when our forebears were still fleeing <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">saber-toothed tigers</ENAMEX>,
natural selection for athletic prowess came into play. But all that ended long
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ago</TIMEX>. Indeed, the laws of natural selection probably work against <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">athletes</ENAMEX> these
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>: Given the rigors of training schedules, it is possible that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s top
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">athletes</ENAMEX> have fewer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> than average.

            
Just because nurture has a more significant
effect on athletic performance doesn't mean that nature lies dormant, though.
Genetic variation exists for just about any trait you choose to study, and the
ability to run quickly would be no exception. To take a trivial case, we know
that the inheritance of extra fingers or toes is determined genetically. It is
quite possible that the possession of an extra toe would hinder an aspiring
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">miler</ENAMEX>--their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> have affected their athletic performance. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> genetic factor
that may be influencing performance trends is what is known as "hybrid vigor."
Cattle <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">breeders</ENAMEX> have known about this for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a long time</TIMEX>: Take <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> inbred lines of
cattle, cross them, and what you have is "better" (say, larger) than any single
individual in either of the two parental lines. This does not require natural
selection; it is the accidental byproduct of combining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> previously isolated
stocks. There are a number of theories to account for this at the genetic
level, but it has proved difficult to discriminate among them. It is possible
that modern <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> exhibit some form of hybrid vigor simply because migration
and admixture of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> are now occurring at unprecedented rates. Perhaps,
just perhaps, such hybridization is being translated into enhanced
performance.

            That doesn't mean, however, that genetic differences in
athletic ability can be correlated automatically with race. That is a claim
that is impossible to test, because you cannot control, in an experimental
sense, environmental differences among the study <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. Sure, you will find
more <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Africans</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">descendants</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Africans</ENAMEX> standing on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">podiums</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the end of</TIMEX>
Olympic track events. And you will find far fewer <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asians</ENAMEX> on those same <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">podiums</ENAMEX>.
But can you, therefore, conclude that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Africans</ENAMEX> have better genes for running
than <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asians</ENAMEX> do? No. Environmental differences between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> could
account for differing levels of athletic success. It is scarcely surprising
that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Ethiopian or Kenyan</ENAMEX> distance <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">runners</ENAMEX> do better than everyone else, since
they are in the habit of running immense distances to and from primary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">middle school</ENAMEX>, and high school. The training is what's crucial, not the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">blackness</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> sports <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">establishment</ENAMEX> also has carried out an enormous,
and effective, experiment to help dispel the myth that race has a direct
relation to athletic ability. Until recently, a quick glance at the medals
table confirmed every stereotype <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> held about <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asians</ENAMEX> and sports. Then the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> decided to produce record-breaking female distance <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">runners</ENAMEX> (and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">swimmers</ENAMEX>), and, boy, did they ever. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> ranked <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Olympic</ENAMEX>-medal haul.

            You can
bring a single generation up to speed through training, but the trends we're
dealing with transcend individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX>. Which brings us to another
question: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Will</ENAMEX> there come a time when the human machine will hit some sort of
natural limit and an <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Olympic Games</ENAMEX> pass without a single record tumbling? In
principle, yes.

            There are some barriers that simply cannot be broken. We
will never run a mile at the same speed at which we now run <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100 meters</NUMEX>, for
instance. The laws of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> will not permit it. Race horses seem
already to have hit that outer limit. For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, they were as good as human
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">athletes</ENAMEX> at pushing back speed records, but then they simply stopped getting
faster. Take the prestigious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Derby</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">From 1850 to 1930</TIMEX>, winning times
dropped from <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2:55 to 2:39</TIMEX>. But from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986 to 1996</TIMEX>, the average time has
been--<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2:39</TIMEX>. Unlike <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, race <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX> are specifically bred and reared to run.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Generations</ENAMEX> of careful genetic selection have ensured that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s race horse
has every possible speed-enhancing characteristic. Training techniques, too,
are tremendously sophisticated. But you can go only so far. You can only breed
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX> with ultralight thin bones to a certain point; the bones will break
under stress if they get any lighter.

            Human improvement, like
race-horse improvement, must eventually bow to the basic constraints of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biomechanics</ENAMEX>. The age of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">menarche</ENAMEX> cannot keep on falling forever. On the other
hand, it is clear from the remarkable demographic changes of just <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past 20</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> that these long-term trends are with us still. They may be slowing down
in some more developed societies, but they roar along in others. And these
trends will continue to fuel the improvement in athletic performance. Several
new records will be set in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Atlanta</ENAMEX>. And in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sydney</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>, and wherever the
Olympics are held in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2044</TIMEX>. We will continue running faster and jumping further
for a good long while to come.
