            The "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Negro</ENAMEX> problem," wrote
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norman Podhoretz</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1963</TIMEX>, would not be solved unless color itself disappeared:
"and that means not integration, it means assimilation, it means--let the
brutal word come out--miscegenation." Coming after a lengthy confession of his
tortured feelings toward <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX>--and coming at a time when <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> still had
anti-miscegenation statutes on the books--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Podhoretz</ENAMEX>'s call for a "wholesale
merging of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> races" seemed not just bold but desperate. Politics had
failed us, he was conceding; now we could find hope only in the unlikely
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prospect</ENAMEX> of intermarriage.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Podhoretz</ENAMEX>'s famous essay
was regarded as bizarre at the time, but <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33 years later</TIMEX>, it seems like
prophecy. We are indeed intermarrying <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, in unprecedented numbers. Between
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1970 and 1992</TIMEX>, the number of mixed-race marriages quadrupled. Black-white
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unions</ENAMEX> now represent <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12 percent</NUMEX> of all marriages involving <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> black,
up from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.6 percent</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1970</TIMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twelve</NUMEX> percent of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25 percent</NUMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> are marrying non-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asians</ENAMEX>. Fully <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a quarter</NUMEX> of married <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>-born
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Latinos</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> have non-Latino <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spouses</ENAMEX>. We are mixing our genes with
such abandon that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Census Bureau</ENAMEX> is now considering whether to add a new
"multiracial" category to the census in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year 2000</TIMEX>. This orgy of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">miscegenation</ENAMEX> has not yet brought the racial harmony for which Podhoretz
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">longed</ENAMEX>. But recent publicity about the intermarriage figures has stirred hope
once again that our racial problems might be dissolving in the gene pool.

            The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Census Bureau</ENAMEX>'s "multiracial" proposal has provoked strong reactions from
civil-rights <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activists</ENAMEX> who fear that many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African Americans</ENAMEX> will defect to the
new category, thus diluting black political power. But the debate, properly
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">framed</ENAMEX>, is not just about "light flight" from the black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX>. The debate
is about our very conception of race. For a "multiracial" box would be an
admission that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> points of our modern-day "ethno-racial pentagon"
(black, white, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asian</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanic</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Native American</ENAMEX>) are not fixed or divinely
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ordained</ENAMEX>, but fickle and all too man-made.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">Race</ENAMEX>, you see, is a fiction. As a matter of biology, it has
no basis. Genetic variations within any race far exceed the variations between
the races, and the genetic similarities among the races swamp both. The power
of race, however, derives not from its pseudoscientific markings but from its
cultural trappings. It is as an ideology that race matters, indeed
matters so much that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biologists</ENAMEX>' protestations fall away like Copernican
claims in the age of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ptolemy</ENAMEX>. So the question, as always, is whether it is
possible to break that awful circle in which myth and morphology perpetually
reinforce one another.

            The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> of the fledgling multiracial movement say that their category, and more
broadly, their lives, represent the way out. By marrying across the color line,
by raising mixed-race <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> without regard to labels, they promise to
obliterate our antiquated notions of racial difference. As a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">newlywed</ENAMEX> who has
recently joined their ranks, I hope they're right. When the time comes, I won't
want to infect my <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scotch</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Irish</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">bloodline fever</ENAMEX>. I
won't force them to choose among ill-fitting racial uniforms. That said,
though, there are plenty of reasons to wonder whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intermarriage</ENAMEX> can ever,
as one partisan put it, "blow the lid off of race."

            Foremost is this reality: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Racialism</ENAMEX> is highly adaptive.
That is, no matter how quickly demographic change proceeds, we seem to find a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> to reinvent and sustain our jerry-rigged pigmentocracy. A case in point is
the term "<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanic</ENAMEX>." Ever since this category was added to the census in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1977</TIMEX>,
we've been told that "<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanic</ENAMEX>" is merely a linguistic category, that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanics</ENAMEX>
"can be of any race." Today, amid a boom in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, we hear
that caveat the same way <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">smokers</ENAMEX> read the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">surgeon general</ENAMEX>'s warning. The story
of the last <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20 years</TIMEX> is the way heterogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanics</ENAMEX>--who ought to have
exposed the flimsiness of racial categories--became just another homogenous
race. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> peg, by our thinking, had been rounded off.

            Will
this happen to "multiracials"? Their numbers are still small. Despite the
quadrupling of multiracial marriages since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1970</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 5 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> today
qualify--and that's counting racially distinct <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> as well as their
mixed-race <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>. This may not be enough of a critical mass for multiracials to
become a race of their own. Moreover, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">multiracials</ENAMEX> have less reason to cohere
than <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanics</ENAMEX> ever had; they include every conceivable combination of races,
and they are not bound together by language. Still, in a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> accustomed to
thinking of "official races," they'll feel pressure to form an interest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>:
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">multiculturalism</ENAMEX>'s latest aggrieved <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tribe</ENAMEX>.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> possibility is that all multiracials, over time, will
find themselves the intermediate race, a new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">middleman</ENAMEX> minority, less
stigmatized than "pure" <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> (however defined) but less acceptable than
"pure" <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX>. Their presence, like that of the "coloreds" in old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Africa</ENAMEX>,
wouldn't subvert racialism; it would reinforce it, by fleshing out the
black-white caste system. Again, however, the sheer diversity of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">multiracials</ENAMEX> might militate against this kind of stratification.

            Yet
this same diversity makes it possible that multiracials will replicate within
their ranks the "white-makes-right" mentality that prevails all around them.
Thus we might expect a hierarchy of multiracials to take hold, in which a mixed
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> with white blood would be the social better of a mixed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> without such
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX>. In this scenario, multiracials wouldn't be a distinct <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>--they would
just be distributed across a continuum of color.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sociologist Pierre van den Berghe</ENAMEX> argues that such a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">continuum</ENAMEX> is preferable to a simple black-white dichotomy. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brazilians</ENAMEX>, for
instance, with their mestizo consciousness and their many gradations of
tipo , or "type," behold with disdain our <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">crude</ENAMEX> bifurcation of race. Yet
no amount of baloney-slicing changes the fact that in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brazil</ENAMEX>, whitening remains
the ideal. It is still better for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> to be a branca (light skin,
hair without tight curls, thin lips, narrow nose) than a morena (tan
skin, wavy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hair</ENAMEX>, thicker lips, broader nose); and better to be a morena
than a mulata (darker skin, tightly curled hair). Subverting racial
labels is not the same as subverting racism.

            Still
another possibility is that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX> will do to multiracials what the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX>
or <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> have traditionally done to third-party movements: absorb their
most "desirable" elements and leave the rest on the fringe. It's quite
possible, as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Professor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Waters</ENAMEX> suggests, that the ranks of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">white</ENAMEX> will simply expand to engulf the "lighter" or more "culturally white" of
the multiracials. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asian American</ENAMEX> experience may offer a precedent: As
growing numbers of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asian Americans</ENAMEX> have entered the mainstream over the last
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decade</TIMEX>, it is increasingly said--sometimes with pride, sometimes with
scorn--that they are "becoming white."

            We could thus end up with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> reconfigured races. In the
"black" box: black-black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">offspring</ENAMEX>. In the "mixed" box: black-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Latino</ENAMEX>,
black-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asian</ENAMEX>, black-white, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Latino</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>. In the "white" box:
white-white, white-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asian</ENAMEX>, and perhaps white-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Latino</ENAMEX> issue. Absurd? <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> need only
recall the baroque lexicon of "quadroons" and "octoroons" to know the absurd
uses to which our <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">powers</ENAMEX> of taxonomy can be put.

            These cautionary scenarios
demonstrate that our problem is not just "race" in the abstract. Our problem is
the idea of the "white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">race</ENAMEX>" in particular. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scholar Douglas Besharov</ENAMEX> may be
right when he calls multiracial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> "the best hope for the future of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
race relations." But even as a "multiracial" category blurs the color line, it
can reaffirm the primacy of whiteness. Whether our focus is interracial
adoption or mixed marriages or class-climbing, so long as we speak of whiteness
as a norm, no amount of census reshuffling will truly matter.

            We return, then, to the
question of politics. Perhaps we should abolish all racial classifications.
Perhaps we should supplement the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>-race scheme with a "None-of-the-<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Above</ENAMEX>"
category. Perhaps we should replace affirmative action with a class-based
alternative. Perhaps we need a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> of mixed heritage--say, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Colin Powell</ENAMEX>--to
educate the public about the realities of race. Whatever it takes, though, we
need to do more than marry one another if we are ever to rid our minds of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">color</ENAMEX>-consciousness. "The way of politics," Podhoretz lamented a generation
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ago</TIMEX>, "is slow and bitter." Indeed. But it is the only lasting way. Our ideology
of "<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX>," like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> itself, is too fluid, too changeable, and too easily
diverted to be remade by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lovers</ENAMEX> alone.
