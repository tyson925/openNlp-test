               Cruella
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">De Vil</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cruella De Vil</ENAMEX>,If she doesn't scare you,No evil thing will.
            

            If your multiplex is like my
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">multiplex</ENAMEX> (and whose multiplex isn't?), when you go to a screening of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">101</NUMEX>
Dalmatians , you will see <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> previews. Here is what <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX> is preparing
for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>: a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> movie, another <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> movie, an ape movie, another
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ape</ENAMEX> movie, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> movie, and another dog movie. In the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> dog movie, the dog
shares top billing with a dolphin.

            The coming plague of animal
films is nothing new. The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last few years</TIMEX> have witnessed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Babe</ENAMEX>
(animatronic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pigs</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sheep</ENAMEX>), several <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Homeward Bound s</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>),
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Free Willy s</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">whale</ENAMEX>), and countless others I have,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mercifully</ENAMEX>, been able to forget. Everywhere you turn, some movie is preaching
interspecies comity and rhapsodizing about <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>' superhuman intelligence.
Any day now I expect my <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> to strike up a conversation with me, probably about
his <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-picture deal with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Castle Rock</ENAMEX>.

            No movie embraces animal
propaganda with as much enthusiasm as the new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">101 Dalmatians</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Disney</ENAMEX>'s
live-action version of its old animated feature. It is the heartwarming animal
movie distilled into its purest form. The cuddliest <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dalmatian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">puppies</ENAMEX>)
are threatened with the most horrible fate (clubbing, skinning, being turned
into fur coats) at the hands of the most villainous villainess, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cruella De Vil</ENAMEX>.
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Strangely</ENAMEX>, we are supposed to revile <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cruella</ENAMEX> for designing fur coats, yet root
for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hero</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger</ENAMEX>, who designs violent, mind-numbing, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soul</ENAMEX>-destroying video
games.)

            
Naturally, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cruella</ENAMEX> gets her comeuppance--a variety of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Home Alone</ENAMEX>- style
agonies inflicted by farm <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> . This teaches the requisite moral
lesson: It is far better to torture a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">human being</ENAMEX> than to allow a single puppy
to come to harm. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dalmatians</ENAMEX> and their human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">masters</ENAMEX> live
happily ever after. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Children</ENAMEX> cheer. Animal-rights <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> coo. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Parents</ENAMEX> drive to
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pet Pantry</ENAMEX> to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dalmatian</ENAMEX> pups for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX>.

            After watching <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">101 Dalmatians</ENAMEX> , I too wanted to drive
to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pet Pantry</ENAMEX> to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dalmatian</ENAMEX> pups ... and skin 'em. After <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">103</NUMEX> hectoring
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> of the movie, I wondered: What's wrong with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cruella De Vil</ENAMEX>? What's
wrong with a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dalmatian</ENAMEX> fur coat? And where can I buy one? How much is that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">doggie</ENAMEX> in the window? While the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ASPCA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PETA</ENAMEX> chapters compose their indignant
letters to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> and heat their vats of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> to a rolling boil, let me
explain.

            There's nothing wrong with
Dalmatians that a good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">furrier</ENAMEX> couldn't fix. The movie <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">101</NUMEX> Dalmatians
promises <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> that are good-natured, healthy, intelligent, resourceful,
gorgeous. Except for the last part, this is a lie. Dalmatians are high-strung.
They're hyperactive. They bark too much. They're bad with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>. They shed
constantly. They're hard to train. (The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dalmatians</ENAMEX> don't even perform tricks in
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">101 Dalmatians</ENAMEX> . An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Airedale</ENAMEX> does the tough stunts; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dalmatians</ENAMEX> merely
bark on cue.) They're ill-suited to living indoors. Many of them are deaf, and
all of them are dumb. They are, in short, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">lousy pets</ENAMEX>.

            This
inspires an equation: Beauty plus difficult temperament equals fur. We do it to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">minks</ENAMEX>. We do it to <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">foxes</ENAMEX>. Why not to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dalmatians</ENAMEX>? <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cruella</ENAMEX> has it right. A fur
coat preserves what is desirable about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dalmatians</ENAMEX>--their beauty--and eliminates
what is undesirable--everything else.

            
There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> main objections to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dalmatian</ENAMEX> fur
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">coats</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> is principled: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fur</ENAMEX> is wrong. It barbarically <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">exploits animals</ENAMEX>,
it's unnecessary, and so on. To this, I offer only the standard fur-industry
reply: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fur</ENAMEX> farming doesn't have to be cruel. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Minks</ENAMEX> live longer on fur farms
than they do in the wild. Dalmatians, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> imagines, could roam more freely on a
large <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">farm</ENAMEX> than in a cramped urban <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX>. And <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dalmatian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX> would not
simply kill <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dalmatians</ENAMEX> for their fur. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Dog meat</ENAMEX> is prized in other parts of the
world. (It used to be in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, too; on his Western expedition with
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clark</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Meriwether Lewis</ENAMEX> raved about it.) Dalmatian <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX> can set up shop in
places where dog <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meat</ENAMEX> is eaten. Maybe <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dalmatian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">burger</ENAMEX> is an ecologically
efficient substitute for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beef</ENAMEX> (though it might dampen enthusiasm for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McDonald's</ENAMEX>
current <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">101 Dalmatians</ENAMEX> promotional campaign).

            The
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> objection to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dalmatian</ENAMEX> farming is visceral. The mere thought of farming
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> for fur nauseates you. With this objection, I sympathize. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Dogs</ENAMEX> are
charming. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> love their <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX>, even their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dalmatians</ENAMEX>. They see something
grotesque in the idea of making them into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter outerwear</TIMEX>. It offends common
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">decency</ENAMEX>.

            Yet, we do cruel things to <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>--smart <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">affectionate animals</ENAMEX>, cute <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>--all the time. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> raised on farms
understand this. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Pigs</ENAMEX> are sociable, loving, and a hell of a lot brighter than
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dalmatians</ENAMEX>. Have you seen what gets done to them ? Do <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX> weep about
it? <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Calves</ENAMEX> are adorable. But veal is delicious.

            Of course, it is argued, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX>--<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>'s best <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX>, the family pet--is different. So says modern bourgeois
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>, which has turned the pet into a full-fledged <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the nuclear
family, even more sacred than other human beings (such as curmudgeonly aunts).
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Disney</ENAMEX>, by anthropomorphizing its critters, exploits this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
mushy-mindedness, and makes us forget that <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pets</ENAMEX> are, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end</TIMEX>, just <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>.
But God gave <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> dominion over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">beasts</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">earth</ENAMEX>: If an <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> has
economic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX>, we should farm it.

            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Disney</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">re</ENAMEX>-released the animated <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">101 Dalmatians</ENAMEX> , demand for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dalmatians</ENAMEX> soared.
Here is a prediction. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">This December</TIMEX>, it will happen again: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Tens of thousands</NUMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> will hound their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> into buying charming <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dalmatian</ENAMEX> pups for
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX>. As before, many of those charming pups will, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</TIMEX>, grow up
into charmless <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Hundreds</NUMEX> of them, perhaps <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX>, will be abandoned or
dropped at the pound. They will be shut up in cages. Later, they will be
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">euthanized</ENAMEX>.

            Now why is that better than
becoming a fur coat?
