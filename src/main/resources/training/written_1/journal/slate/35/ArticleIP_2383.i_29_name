            Before <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Clinton</ENAMEX> starts
looking for ways to pay for the new aid to college-bound <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> he's
proposing--or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> returns to its budget-cutting fervor--both ought to take
a refresher course in the perversities and absurdities that abound in our
current <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX>-subsidy programs. There's big money to be saved. Just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
programs--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pell Grants</ENAMEX> and subsidized student loans--made up <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$22 billion</NUMEX> of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Department</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Education</ENAMEX> budget (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about two-thirds</NUMEX>), and a lot of that money is
spent in dubious ways.

            <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">About 10 percent</NUMEX> of that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">$22</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">billion</ENAMEX> goes down the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> hole to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> who, either because they lie about
their qualifications or because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> makes a mistake, don't, in fact,
qualify. Another <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">few billion</NUMEX> goes to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> whose major qualification is that
their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> are divorced. Billions more send middle- and upper-class <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> to
expensive private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>. Still <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more millions</NUMEX> subsidize such odd <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> as
single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> with rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>.

            To be
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fair</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> inherited this mess. But he also made a big deal out of reforming
it. His accomplishment? He's stopped <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX> from taking advantage of the system
to skim <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a few hundred dollars</NUMEX> off the top of each new student loan. Meanwhile,
the system's other, much bigger abuses (some created on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s watch)
continue unabated.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Silly Social</ENAMEX>
Incentives
            

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Education</ENAMEX> has the common-sense idea that
if <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> have the means, they ought to help their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> with their college
costs before <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers</ENAMEX> are asked to assist. But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> has created a handful
of handy ways to ditch rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>. Follow these rules to become an
independent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX>, and no matter how much your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> make, the government
will consider you poor and in need of aid.

            Tie the knot: Suddenly
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>' income and assets no longer count toward determining whether or not a
student is poor. Of course, young marriage is the most likely to end in
divorce.

            Do nothing: If a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX> sits
around till he's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX>, he becomes an independent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX>, too, not because his
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> kicked him out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>, but because, well, just because. And, for
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX> who can't quite get his or her act together, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> is willing
to pay for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">up to six years</TIMEX> of undergraduate education. Has this subsidy
contributed to an increase in the number of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> it takes to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">graduate</ENAMEX>? Today,
fewer than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40 percent</NUMEX> of college <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students graduate</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four years</TIMEX>; a quarter
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">century ago</TIMEX> the number was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 percent</NUMEX>.

            Have an illegitimate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>:
This special qualifying factor, added by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">103 rd</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>, is solely for the benefit of upper- and middle-class single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX>,
who are now allowed to disregard their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>' income in applying for loans
and grants. Remember, getting married already separates college <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> from
their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>'s eyes, and poor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> are already eligible for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pell</ENAMEX>
Grants and subsidized loans. As a result of these and other ways to make
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> legally independent of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>, the number of independent
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> has skyrocketed--in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the '70s</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">fewer than 20 percent</NUMEX> of undergrads were
independent; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than half</NUMEX> are.

            Dump <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX>:
The granddaddy of all the stupid social incentives isn't for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>, it's for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dads</ENAMEX>. If you're a middle-class <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> who can't afford to send your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">college</ENAMEX>, divorce your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayer</ENAMEX> will end up sending your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX> to school
because divorced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fathers</ENAMEX>' income isn't counted under current rules. (Even
though married <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dads</ENAMEX> aren't legally required to pay for their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>' college
either, their income is always counted by the feds.) This policy helps explain
why there are <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 percent</NUMEX> more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> with divorced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX>-aid
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">recipients</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than a million</NUMEX> in total) than among the general student
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">population</ENAMEX>, according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center for Education Statistics</ENAMEX>. Private schools
count the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>'s income in determining if his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> are in need--<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Uncle Sam</ENAMEX>
should, too.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Waste</ENAMEX>
            

            
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Research Council</ENAMEX> study
found that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 10 percent</NUMEX> of all federal financial aid was awarded in
error. This was the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">th</ENAMEX> study since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1975</TIMEX>--and all studies showed
similar problems. A <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Accounting Office</ENAMEX> report showed the breadth of
incompetence in financial-aid <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>--<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1982 and 1992</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43,519</NUMEX>
ineligible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> received subsidized loans. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Between 1989 and 1993</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48,000</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> received <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pell Grant</ENAMEX> overpayments; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35,000</NUMEX> received <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pell</ENAMEX> Grants from two
separate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> simultaneously; and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">101,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>, ineligible for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pell</ENAMEX>
Grants because they had defaulted on federally guaranteed loans, received them
anyway.

            Consider
just the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pell</ENAMEX> Grants for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> who have already defaulted on past loans:
That one mistake cost <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$210 million</NUMEX>.

            When is a dollar not a dollar? Well, that's complicated--in
terms of being in need, here's the list of dollars that don't count as
dollars:

            If <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> made less than
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$50,000</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX>, none of their assets count as available to help pay for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">college</ENAMEX>.

            Dollars invested in a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">house</ENAMEX>--even a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$5 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>--don't count (this also brought to you by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton in 1993).</ENAMEX>

            Dollars in retirement
accounts, including deferred salary, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">401K</TIMEX> plans, and IRAs don't count.

            Dollars put in the names of
other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> in the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> don't count.

            What
difference do all these rules make? <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> who know how to use them (usually
not the poor) can makes themselves look awfully pitiable. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">About 15 percent</NUMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">undergraduates</ENAMEX> whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> have incomes in excess of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$50,000</NUMEX> get federal
grants and subsidized loans, costing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>, on average, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$4,000</NUMEX>--which
is <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">several hundred dollars</NUMEX> more than is spent for those whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> earn less
than <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$50,000</NUMEX>.

Need doesn't depend only on how <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> arrange
their income and assets. It also depends on where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> want to go to
school. If <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bobby Middle-class</ENAMEX> decides to go to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State U.</ENAMEX>, the feds will offer no
help. But, if he wants to go to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard</ENAMEX>, well that's a different story. What
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Education</ENAMEX> really measures with its financial-aid programs is
relative need. If the same rules were applied to food stamps, here's how it
would work: Take the food stamps into a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX> and pick out hamburger and canned
green <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beans</ENAMEX>, the stamps are worth <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a dollar</NUMEX>. Pick out <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lobster</ENAMEX> and truffles, and
the food stamps are worth <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$20</NUMEX>.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Education</ENAMEX>'s statistics speak for themselves: At <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two-year</TIMEX> public <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">colleges</ENAMEX>, which
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> says all <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> should be able to afford, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 percent</NUMEX> get financial
aid. At private <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four-year</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">colleges</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">45 percent</NUMEX> get help from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayer</ENAMEX>.

            This strategy is even more
costly to nonsubsidized <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> than to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers</ENAMEX>. Consider the incentive the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">financial-aid</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> sends even low-cost <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">colleges</ENAMEX>--the more you charge, the
more aid your "needy" <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> will get and, since "need" is determined
relative to cost, the more "needy" <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> you will have. It's hard to find an
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> who doesn't believe this is a recipe for inflation. And indeed, since
the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-'70s</TIMEX>, the cost of attending <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">college</ENAMEX> has more than quadrupled in real
terms.

            So here's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s lesson for
both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>: Whether you want to save money on federal
education aid or add benefits for more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">needy students</ENAMEX>, the way to come up with
the needed dollars is to stop subsidizing a stupid system.
