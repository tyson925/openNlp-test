            <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> morality is a
curious thing. It is capable of focusing on certain kinds of misbehavior with
halogenlike intensity for short periods of time. But it's also highly
selective, often preoccupying itself with one modish ethical issue to the
exclusion of others that are equally serious. Since the election, everyone has
been consumed with outrage over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinton</ENAMEX>
campaign-finance scandal and, by extension, over anything related to
political fund raising. But no one seems to care any more about influence
peddling, a category of sleaze that is equally pervasive, arguably more venal,
and much more easily cured.

            As cases
in point, consider <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> current examples: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Haley Barbour</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexis Herman</ENAMEX>. In
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Republican Party</ENAMEX>, no one bats <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an eyelash</TIMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barbour</ENAMEX> offers himself as a
gun-for-hire, available to lobby congressional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> to whom he was giving
policy advice just <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few months ago</TIMEX>. And among <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX>, it isn't considered
either surprising or scandalous that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> would nominate as secretary
of labor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexis Herman</ENAMEX>, the most accomplished swinger through <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>'s
revolving doors since the death of her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mentor</ENAMEX>, the late <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ron Brown</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barbour</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herman</ENAMEX> are about as different in background and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">temperament</ENAMEX> as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beltway</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">insiders</ENAMEX> can be. He's a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> good ol' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> from
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yazoo City</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Miss.</ENAMEX>, whose colorful metaphors invariably invoke <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pigs</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mules</ENAMEX>. She grew up on the other side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Old South</ENAMEX>'s racial divide, and
speaks flavorless corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>. He likes to be in front of the cameras.
She likes to work behind the scenes. But they're basically in the same
business. Both have prospered in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">skillfully</ENAMEX> exploiting the
intersection of public policy and private interests.

            Let's take
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barbour</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>. Despite <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Dole</ENAMEX>'s defeat, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barbour</ENAMEX> was considered a great
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">success</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Committee</ENAMEX>, a job he held until
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last month</TIMEX>. Under <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barbour's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> raised <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$312 million</NUMEX> in the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> election cycle, a record amount credited with saving the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Republican</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>. How did <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barbour</ENAMEX> raise all that money? He did it by being more
explicit than ever before about the connection between big contributions and
what is euphemistically called "access." <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Corporations</ENAMEX> that gave <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$250,000</NUMEX> or
more became <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> "<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX>-ticket <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holders</ENAMEX>," with regular opportunities to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">schmooze GOP</ENAMEX> congressional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX>. They were even assigned special <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Republican</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Committee</ENAMEX> staff <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> to help with their problems in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>.
After the election, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barbour</ENAMEX> scolded <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Business Roundtable</ENAMEX> for
giving some <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 percent</NUMEX> of their donations to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX>. Without exclusive
support, he threatened, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> might not prove so effective a conduit for
business interests.

            
In his new private capacity, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barbour</ENAMEX> holds out
the promise of being a very effective conduit himself. As soon as his term as
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> ended, he returned to his old lobbying-law <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barbour Griffith</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">& Rogers</ENAMEX>, and founded a semidetached "strategic communications" <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX> with
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ed Gillespie</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gillespie</ENAMEX>, the former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief of staff</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Majority Leader</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dick Armey</ENAMEX>, is best known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> who came up with the idea for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Contract</ENAMEX>
With <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>. As a former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gillespie</ENAMEX> is bound by the
post-employment restrictions that apply to ex-congressional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff members</ENAMEX>. But
Barbour, who hasn't worked in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> since the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>, can
start lobbying <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Newt Gingrich</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Armey</ENAMEX> right away. And <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gillespie</ENAMEX> can, of
course, give <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barbour</ENAMEX> plenty of advice on how to go about doing so.

            The
combination of high-powered <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">connections</ENAMEX> and freedom from legal restraints makes
Barbour uniquely valuable to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporations</ENAMEX> involved in what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> call
"<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rent-</ENAMEX>seeking." According to a short item in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX>'s Wall Street
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barbour</ENAMEX> immediately faced a bidding war for his services between
the regional phone <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> and the long-distance services <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">AT&T</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCI</ENAMEX>.
The regional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> appear to have had deeper pockets--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barbour</ENAMEX> went with
them. Neither <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barbour</ENAMEX> nor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gillespie</ENAMEX> responded to phone calls, or to a faxed
list of questions. But according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barbour</ENAMEX> will focus on
the implementation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Telecommunications Act</ENAMEX>, which involves issues
relating to how soon the long-distance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> can compete in the
local-service market. Consumer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> tend to side with the long-distance
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> in their dispute with the regional ones. But whatever the merits of
his case are or aren't, it will be pretty amusing to watch <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barbour</ENAMEX> take sides
in a propaganda war after letting everybody know he was available to work for
either side on mercenary terms.

            When it comes to the revolving door, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexis Herman</ENAMEX> is less
of a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bigfoot</ENAMEX> than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barbour</ENAMEX> but more of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">innovator</ENAMEX>. As <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Women</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bureau</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Labor Department</ENAMEX> during the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carter</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>, she helped to
write regulations requiring federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">contractors</ENAMEX> to comply with goals and
timetables for hiring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minorities</ENAMEX>. After she left the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Labor Department</ENAMEX>, she set
up a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX> to advise <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> on how to comply with those regulations. But
that's not the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of it. According to a recent story in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Business Week</ENAMEX> ,
when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herman</ENAMEX> was at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Labor</ENAMEX>, she also helped to steer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> job-training
grants to a firm she once worked for as well as to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youth</ENAMEX>-training program run
by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesse Jackson</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackson</ENAMEX>, a very close <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herman</ENAMEX>'s, spent much of the
1980s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boycotting</ENAMEX> and threatening boycotts against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX> whose minority-hiring
practices he deemed inadequate. In most cases, he negotiated settlements with
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> he targeted--settlements that often included a recommendation to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hire Herman</ENAMEX> as a diversity <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultant</ENAMEX>. More recently, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackson</ENAMEX> helped <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herman</ENAMEX> by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lobbying Clinton</ENAMEX> to name her and not former <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harris Wofford</ENAMEX> as
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX> of labor.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">press</ENAMEX>,
gripped by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herman</ENAMEX>'s not-especially-notable part in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democratic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Committee</ENAMEX> fund-raising scandal, has largely ignored the many interesting
convolutions in her various roles. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herman</ENAMEX> kept her consulting business going
even after she became <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief of staff</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ron Brown</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DNC</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX>, a clear
conflict of interest. Under one particularly lucrative diversity-consulting
contract, which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> are now looking into, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herman</ENAMEX> advised
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">developer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herbert Miller</ENAMEX> on how to comply with minority-hiring
guidelines on a project called <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Market Square</ENAMEX>. In addition to a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$205,000</NUMEX>
payment, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herman</ENAMEX> got an ownership stake in the deal, which is now listed on her
financial-disclosure forms as being worth <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between $500,000 and $1 million</NUMEX>.
(<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miller</ENAMEX>, a big contributor to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DNC</ENAMEX>, had <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> last
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>.) According to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herman</ENAMEX> has often lent an inside helping
hand to another longtime <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">super-lawyer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vernon Jordan</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jordan</ENAMEX>'s corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Airlines</ENAMEX>, a very happy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> this
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week</TIMEX>. It would be interesting to know what role <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herman</ENAMEX> played in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>'s decision to break the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Airlines</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX>' strike.

            
I'm not suggesting that any of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herman</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">liaising</ENAMEX> around is illegal. But noncriminality is a pretty low standard for
appointment to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cabinet</ENAMEX>. It is the standard, however, that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinton</ENAMEX>
administration has applied, not only in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herman</ENAMEX>'s case, but even more notably in
the choice of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ron Brown</ENAMEX> for the post of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX> of commerce. In the case of
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX>, ethical standards are, if anything, lower. During the last
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gingrich</ENAMEX> rehabilitated convicted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">felon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Deaver</ENAMEX> as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Republican</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adviser</ENAMEX> in good standing, while the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dole</ENAMEX> campaign brought such notorious
sleaze-meisters as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lyn Nofziger</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Manafort</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charlie Black</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Sears</ENAMEX>
back into the fold.

            Like
campaign finance, revolving-door lobbying is a systemic problem in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
politics. The difference is that whereas campaign finance is an immensely
complicated problem that can only be fixed with changes in the law, the Augean
stables of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K Street</ENAMEX> could be cleaned up pretty easily if anyone cared. All it
would take is for a few prominent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> to stop elevating <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lobbyists</ENAMEX> to
high <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>, and to quit taking their calls. It's a cheap, easy, and effective
solution that unfortunately doesn't fit in with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this season</TIMEX>'s spasm of
morality.
