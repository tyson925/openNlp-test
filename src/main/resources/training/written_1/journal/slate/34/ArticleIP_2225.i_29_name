               Supplies
Are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unlimited</ENAMEX>, but Order Now Anyway
            

            You have just a few more
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>--until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 9</TIMEX>--to sign up for your <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Charter Subscription</ENAMEX> to

                  Slate
               . After that date, only paying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subscribers</ENAMEX> will have full
access to the site, e-mail-delivery services, "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Compost</ENAMEX>," <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">"The Fray</ENAMEX>," and so
on. To be perfectly honest, subscriptions will continue to be available after
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 9</TIMEX> (on the Internet, you don't run out). So why subscribe now? Well, we're
giving away a 
                  Slate
                umbrella or a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft Encarta Virtual Globe</ENAMEX>
with each paid sub--and those really might run out. Or suppose it's <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3 a.m. and</TIMEX>
you can't sleep, so you decide to turn on the old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">machine</ENAMEX> and check if there's
a new 
                  Slate
                "Chatterbox" item--but you've left your wallet and
credit cards in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedroom</ENAMEX> and don't want to wake your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>. You'd be stuck
playing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Solitaire</ENAMEX>. Keep in mind that your sub begins <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 9</TIMEX> even if you sign
up early. And only charter <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subscribers</ENAMEX> are guaranteed the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$19.95</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> rate
for as long as they renew. So click here to
subscribe, and do it now. Our computers are standing by to take your order.
You may also subscribe by phone at (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">800</ENAMEX>) <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">706-3330</TIMEX>. Or by fax, camel, blood
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">transfusion</ENAMEX>, or any other way we can figure out. Go to our subscription page

                  Slate
                has
launched <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> new interactive puzzles in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past week</TIMEX>: a weekly Web maze game
called <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">"Six Degrees of Francis Bacon</ENAMEX>" and a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX>-<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX>

                  Slate
                "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">News Quiz</ENAMEX>." They offer fun, intellectual stimulation, and insight
on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Web</ENAMEX> and the news. What they don't offer is a prize. It's not that we're
cheap (or not just that we're cheap). It's that under the laws of
various <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, a prize turns these innocent amusements into a form of
gambling, which creates more legal folderol than we are prepared to handle. But
it just might happen--we're not promising , you understand--that
some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">winners</ENAMEX> of these contests get a token of trivial value as a purely
symbolic gesture of thanks for their participation in a contest with no
prize.

            
               Another
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Contest You Didn't Win</ENAMEX>
            

            Posted on
our site at the moment are the results of another contest with no official
prize: <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the final 1997</TIMEX> tally of the "
                  Slate
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60</TIMEX>," our <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> rating of
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>'s most generous givers. Several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of that list are known to
be 
                  Slate
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX>, but the law of averages suggests it's a safe
bet that you're not one of them. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prize</ENAMEX> for giving to charity is, of course,
the knowledge that you're fulfilling a moral obligation and helping to make the
world just a little bit, etc., etc. But the premise of the 
                  Slate
               
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60</TIMEX>, actually, is less noble: It is that the spirit of self-aggrandizement,
one-upmanship, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trump-thy-neighbor</ENAMEX> can be channeled into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">charity</ENAMEX> by making
it a race. This notion was first advanced by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ted Turner</ENAMEX>, who has personally
vindicated it by racing to No. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> on the list in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">its second year</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prize</ENAMEX>, in
other words, is being on the list itself. And it may even be working. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last year</TIMEX>
you had to give away <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$5 million</NUMEX> to make the list. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">This year</TIMEX> it took <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$10</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">million</ENAMEX>. Congratulations to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX>'s winners.
