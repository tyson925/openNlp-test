            From the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">halls</ENAMEX> of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heritage Foundation</ENAMEX> to the shooting ranges of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Rifle Association</ENAMEX>,
you can hear the clang and the clatter of right-wing infighting. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trent Lott</ENAMEX> faces a constant barrage of accusations that he has sold out. In the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defenders</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">plotters</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last July</TIMEX>'s attempted coup remain in a state
of high paranoid alert. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Christian Coalition</ENAMEX> is struggling with the
departure of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ralph Reed</ENAMEX> and a scandal over the abuse of its tax-exempt status.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Spectator</ENAMEX> fired the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publisher</ENAMEX>, apparently for
asking too many questions about how the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> spent grants from the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">far-right Scaife Foundation</ENAMEX>. At the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Review</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William F. Buckley</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jr.</ENAMEX> just sacked his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John O'Sullivan</ENAMEX>, for reasons as yet unexplained.
It's now nearly impossible to find a conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX> not in some sort
of turmoil.

            These
conflicts aren't all ideological. They're about power, money, status, and
various admixtures of these factors with politics. But all are symptoms of the
conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">movement</ENAMEX>'s current state of embattlement. Since the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gingrich</ENAMEX>
revolution went sour in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>--and in a larger sense, since the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> began
feuding over <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Bush</ENAMEX>'s tax increase in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX>--<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">conservatives</ENAMEX> have been a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tribe</ENAMEX> lost in the wilderness. With no common program and no forceful or even
universally acceptable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX>, factions assert themselves with growing
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nastiness</ENAMEX>. As the many sides scuffle, their only shared sentiments are contempt
for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Clinton</ENAMEX> and nostalgia for the unity they once embraced under the Holy
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan Empire</ENAMEX>.

            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">These days</TIMEX>, it is <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX> who seem to have absorbed
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX>'s lesson about the value of submerging differences for the sake of
victory. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX>, meanwhile, seem to have studied under the querulous
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George McGovern</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">era</TIMEX>. They're more interested in kicking and
gouging each other than in taking on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enemy</ENAMEX>. Look at what should have been
their crowning achievement. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">This year</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> finally won an
ostensibly balanced budget. But it failed to get much credit for it, in part
because of bitter denunciations of the deal from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">radicals</ENAMEX> who like to
be known as the "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hezbollah</ENAMEX>." The big political event <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this summer</TIMEX> was the
successful effort by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> kind of anti-government <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX>--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesse Helms</ENAMEX>--to
prevent another kind of anti-government <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX>--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Weld</ENAMEX>--from becoming
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ambassador</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social</ENAMEX> conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Weyrich</ENAMEX> recently made the
cover of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Republic</ENAMEX> as a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Robespierre</ENAMEX> who is destroying
his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> in a mad quest for conservative purity. Without elevating these often
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">petty</ENAMEX> struggles into a war of "ideas," it may be worth asking: What are these
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> ripping themselves up about?

            In
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">essence</ENAMEX>, they are fighting about what has been their most fundamental internal
difference since the reign of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Franklin Roosevelt</ENAMEX>--the modern role of the
federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>. The good news is that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conservatives</ENAMEX> are debating the
question of what <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> should and should not do more openly, and with a
greater degree of realism, than they have for some time. The bad news is that
the honesty and realism are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relative</ENAMEX>.

            
The breakthrough is that some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conservatives</ENAMEX> now
are willing to question the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> dogma that a big and powerful federal
government is inherently oppressive and evil. This glasnost was first
visible in a column titled <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">"What Ails Conservatism</ENAMEX>," by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Kristol</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Brooks</ENAMEX>, that ran in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last month</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kristol</ENAMEX>,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Weekly Standard</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brooks</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> for the same
publication, argue that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> bashing that carried <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> to
congressional power in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX> makes a lousy governing philosophy. "How can
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> love their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> if they hate its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>?" they ask
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">succinctly</ENAMEX>.

            In place
of demands for diminishment and devolution, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kristol</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brooks</ENAMEX> propose "a
return to national greatness." They urge <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> to eschew Jeffersonian
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">libertarianism</ENAMEX> and to take up the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nationalist</ENAMEX> tradition of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander Hamilton</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Clay</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Theodore Roosevelt</ENAMEX>. (The only name missing from their genealogy
is that of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herbert Croly</ENAMEX>, one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founders</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Progressive Movement</ENAMEX> who
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> put this <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> nationalist tradition together.) The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">liberal</ENAMEX> overtones
of this synthesis are not surprising when you consider where the National
Greatness cons come from. They represent a merger of the shrunken remnants of
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> formerly powerful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX>: the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockefeller</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> and the New York
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neoconservatives</ENAMEX>. Both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> have long wished for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conservatives</ENAMEX> to do what
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Bennett</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John DiIulio Jr.</ENAMEX> recommend they do in the new issue of
Commentary : make peace with the New Deal and get on with their
lives.

            The national-greatness line has been bitterly attacked by
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> other kinds of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conservatives</ENAMEX> who were always hostile to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neocons</ENAMEX>--<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">libertarians</ENAMEX> and populists. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Libertarians</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dick Armey</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phil</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gramm</ENAMEX> argue that enlarging freedom, by which they mean shrinking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>, is
the only valid goal of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX>. Populists, who see the greatness cons as an
elitist menace and as a moderate <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>, have different objections. Though
they themselves support government regulation in the moral sphere, populists
hate the idea of national power, because to them, national means federal and
federal means <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">liberal</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Libertarians</ENAMEX> and populists do share a political argument
against big-government conservatism. Both think <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beltway</ENAMEX>-bashing is
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">conservatism</ENAMEX>'s most effective organizing tool and rallying cry.

            There are
some other conservative strains at large, such as the now totally mystifying
cultural conservatism of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Bork</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bork</ENAMEX> was once a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">libertarian</ENAMEX> who opposed
the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Civil Rights Act of 1964</ENAMEX> because it interfered with the right of free
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX>. He danced away from that view in a failed attempt to make it to
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bork</ENAMEX> has cast himself as a cranky
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pessimist</ENAMEX>. In a piece in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> , he attacked both the
greatness cons and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">libertarian critics</ENAMEX> for being insufficiently gloomy.
Both sides, he wrote, failed to focus on moral decay as evidenced by such
problems as relativism and the "disastrous feminization of education," whatever
that means. But <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a week later</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bork</ENAMEX>, in his old libertarian guise, wrote a piece
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> that denounced his fellow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">moralist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bennett</ENAMEX>'s
criticism of liquor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conservatives</ENAMEX> now seem to have no ideology
other than attacking all other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conservatives</ENAMEX>.

            
To describe these debates is to make them sound
more rigorous and intellectually serious than they really are. In practice, all
conservative factions are still caught up in the free-lunch ethos of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reaganism</ENAMEX>.
The greatness cons want to have their pro-government rhetoric and to eat their
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">anti-government cake</ENAMEX>, too. The actual projects <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kristol</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brooks</ENAMEX> call for to
renew national purpose are things like privatizing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX>, and pushing for a voucher system of school choice. In other words,
most of the activity they want their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activist</ENAMEX> federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> to engage in
involves dismantling the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>. The greatness cons do want more
federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> in the form of an interventionist foreign policy. But they
disingenuously assume that we can have more for less than we're spending <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">now</TIMEX>. A
bigger defense and more tax cuts. No sacrifice is ever asked of the public.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">libertarians</ENAMEX> have a more
consistent philosophical position, but they offer the reverse hypocrisy in
practice. They wallow in anti-government rhetoric as if <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oklahoma City</ENAMEX> had never
been bombed, but make no assault on the federal leviathan. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> like
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gramm</ENAMEX> beat up the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> and promise endless tax reductions while bringing home
pork projects to their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">constituents</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Conservatives</ENAMEX> may look as though they're
finally debating the real issue. But unfortunately, the debate is mainly about
how to posture.
