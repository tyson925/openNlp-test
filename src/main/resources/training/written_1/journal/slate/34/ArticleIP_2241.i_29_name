<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Lost That Story</ENAMEX>
            

            At 
                  Slate
               , we
do not go whoring after scoops. While <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">others</ENAMEX> chase <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">semen-stained</ENAMEX> cocktail
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dresses</ENAMEX> and sweat through the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beltway</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> humidity in pursuit of leaks, we
sit back in our breezy <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific Northwest</ENAMEX> aerie, sipping a microbrew, observing,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">analyzing</ENAMEX>, synthesizing, and generally thinking great thoughts. Or at any rate
thinking thoughts. But we are not above indulging in a scoop if it falls into
our lap. For <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a few hours</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</TIMEX>, we thought we had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>.

            Over the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">weekend</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalist friend</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> e-mailed us an article. It was by a
former <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> intelligence <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MI5</TIMEX>? MI6? MI7? Who can keep them
straight?), telling tales out of school about alleged attempts by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intelligence</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MI8</TIMEX>? MI9?) to kill <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Muammar Qaddafi</ENAMEX>, the prominent <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Libyan</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">statesman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">murderer</ENAMEX>. A bomb intended for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Qaddafi</ENAMEX> allegedly blew up the wrong
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>, killing innocent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. At the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>'s request, the author
of this tale was arrested <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>. Our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX>, and all
other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> papers, were forbidden to publish the article under <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">notorious Official Secrets Act</ENAMEX>. But 
                  Slate
                could publish it on the
Internet, he reasoned, and in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Drudge</ENAMEX>-like fashion avoid the constraints on
print journalism and draw attention to ourselves. The story would get out and
the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Official Secrets Act</ENAMEX> would be exposed as a farce in the age of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cyberspace</ENAMEX>.

            We did what any red-blooded <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> would do in such a
situation. We consulted our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX>. He told us it's not so simple. (The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX>' mantra.) 
                  Slate
                also might be subject to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Official</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Secrets Act</ENAMEX>. If we published this article, not only could our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> be
stopped at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Heathrow</ENAMEX> on their way to pay homage at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diana</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>, but the
assets of our parent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> could be seized, and so on. Imagine <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of
Windows <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">98</TIMEX> CD-ROMs going moldy in some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> warehouse! The heart <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sickens</ENAMEX>.
Could we in good conscience risk denying the plucky <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> this
marvelous operating system, with its fully integrated Internet browser?

            Our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> said we might
escape <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>'s ridiculous censorship laws by arguing that we are an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
publication, and any seepage into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> was purely unintentional. Or we might
note that the story--it's now <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific</ENAMEX> time--was already
dribbling out. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">London Sunday Times</ENAMEX> had mentioned the alleged Qaddafi
plot, comically reasoning that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> claims the story is untrue, and
something that never happened cannot be an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Official Secret</ENAMEX>. Just to be safe,
though, the reference was buried deep within an article on something less
interesting. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX>, other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX> reported that other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> papers
had reported the story.

            But in
truth, getting the story into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> was not incidental: It was the main idea.
And to the extent the story was already out in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>, we had little interest
in publishing it. In short, we realized, our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX>'s efforts were futile:
There was a perfect inverse correlation between our desire to publish the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">article</ENAMEX> and our legal ability to do so. Basically, if it didn't violate the
Official <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Secrets Act</ENAMEX>, there was no point.

            
This conclusion turned a potential scoop into a
potential stand on principle, which is even more exciting. Should we ask
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft Corp.</ENAMEX> to prove its bona fides as a media <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> by backing an act of
journalistic civil disobedience? That sounded like a lot of fun, but first we
had to figure out which principle, exactly, was at stake.

            Was it
the right of the Internet to be free of all government restrictions? No. We are
comfortable with the idea that some national security information--the names of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> in hostile <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> is the usual example--should not be published and
that such constraints should not have to depend on every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalist</ENAMEX> in the
world acting voluntarily. The Internet makes enforcement of any restrictions on
the spread of information much more difficult. But it does not, as far as we
can see, affect the principle that society ought to have the right to prevent
or punish publication of some information.

            Was the principle at stake here the right to be free of
stupid and/or unnecessary government restrictions? <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Governments</ENAMEX> will always
claim too much secret territory. A botched assassination attempt that killed
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">innocents</ENAMEX> is just the kind of thing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> ought to know about, while the
government won't want them to know. But it makes no sense for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalist</ENAMEX> to
say, "I don't mind being censored, but only about information I wouldn't
publish anyway." There's no need for a law to prevent you from doing what you
wouldn't do anyway. If you concede the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>'s (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">society</ENAMEX>'s) right to rule
some information out of bounds, you must also concede the right to draw the
line in a place you disagree with.

            Of course
civil disobedience--breaking the law (and taking the punishment)--is a valid,
even noble, way to dramatize iniquity and create pressure for change. For

                  Slate
               , a basically <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publication</ENAMEX>, to risk its future on a
crusade to reform the excessive secrecy laws of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United Kingdom</ENAMEX> would have
been a lovely gesture. But somehow it did not seem morally mandatory. Let the
Brits care for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brits</ENAMEX>.

            
So maybe the principle is that Internet
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">publications</ENAMEX> shouldn't be subject to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stupid</ENAMEX> and/or unnecessary censorship by
foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX>. Although, with Internet access, you can get

                  Slate
                as easily in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rwanda</ENAMEX> as in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Redmond</ENAMEX>, so perhaps the rule
should be that every Web site must follow the laws of its "home" <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, and
no other. After all, if an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publication</ENAMEX> like 
                  Slate
                finds
itself subject to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Official Secrets Act</ENAMEX>, this turns the Internet's
promise of freedom on its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX>. Not only are we not liberated from our

               particular national jurisdiction: We are simultaneously subject to
every 
               other national jurisdiction. 
                  Slate
                is content
to obey the laws of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, even laws we don't care for. But the
notion of, say, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Belgium</ENAMEX> popping up to enjoin us from criticizing moules
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">frites</ENAMEX> seems unfair.

            Trouble is, the Internet
makes a farce of any such <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-Web-site-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-country solution, as the case in
hand demonstrates. Our <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> instantly and effortlessly e-mailed us
the rogue <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spy</ENAMEX>'s article, and if we hadn't been worried about <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> law we
would have made it as instantly and effortlessly available in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> as if
he'd published it himself. In this case that would have been a happy result.
But what happens when those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>' names get e-mailed from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>
to, oh, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Libya</ENAMEX> and immediately get posted on <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">muammar</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX>? As a practical
matter this may be unavoidable. And, to be clear about it, the massive
censorship necessary to avoid it is certainly not worth the cost in freedom.
But there's no point in pretending that a Web site subject to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>'s laws is actually subject to any at all.

            So in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end</TIMEX> we were denied
both an exhilarating scoop and an invigorating stand on principle. There is an
obvious opportunity here for a bonanza of international conferences to study
the need for worldwide treaties to set up global commissions to come up with
transnational standards for ... oh God, we can't go on. There must be an easier
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX>. Any suggestions?
