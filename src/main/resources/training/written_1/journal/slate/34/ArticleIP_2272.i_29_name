            When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Woodward</ENAMEX>'s byline
appears on Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> , it generally means: It's
time to pay attention. And indeed, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Woodward</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 8</TIMEX> story, an
it's-even-worse-than-you-thought piece about the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> campaign-finance
scandal, sounded pretty sordid. It reported that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> had
tipped off the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democratic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Committee</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX> about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Grigori Loutchansky</ENAMEX>,
a bad-egg <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latvian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">businessman</ENAMEX> with alleged ties to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Russian Mafia</ENAMEX>.
Loutchansky, who had been invited to meet the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> at a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$25,000-</NUMEX>a-plate
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fund-raiser</ENAMEX> (with a ticket paid for by an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">associate</ENAMEX>), was
promptly uninvited. The reason this is troublesome is that the news about
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Loutchansky</ENAMEX>'s background came indirectly from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Security</ENAMEX>
Administration, and that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DNC</ENAMEX> who lack security clearances were
thus <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX> of an unauthorized leak of highly classified information.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNN</ENAMEX>
played this revelation <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all day</TIMEX>, and the other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> reported it on the
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</TIMEX> news. "If this allegation proves true, and this disclosure actually
took place, it constitutes a felony violation," said <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Porter Goss</ENAMEX>, a
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> who chairs the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> intelligence committee. "I am very
troubled by the implications for breaches of long-standing security controls at
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> and the apparent misuse of intelligence information for
political purposes."

            In this furor, a few significant details were overlooked,
however. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> was that the essence of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Woodward</ENAMEX>'s "scoop" had been reported
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two-and-a-half weeks earlier</TIMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Times</ENAMEX> . The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX>
relied on what looks to have been the same source--a leak from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indiana</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Burton</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Government Reform & Oversight Committee</ENAMEX>, which had apparently got
wind of the issue via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DNC</ENAMEX> documents handed over in response to a subpoena. When
the story appeared in the Moonie-owned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> , no one cared. Only the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Woodward</ENAMEX> imprimatur made it national news.

            A more
significant problem with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Woodward</ENAMEX>'s story is that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DNC</ENAMEX> didn't need any
classified leaks to find out that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Loutchansky</ENAMEX>, who had met the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> at an
earlier fund-raiser in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>, was trouble. Before the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX> dinner even took
place, none other than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Safire</ENAMEX> had written about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Loutchansky</ENAMEX> in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> , noting that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latvian</ENAMEX> had been refused entry into
Canada <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the previous year</TIMEX> because of suspected "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Mafiya</ENAMEX>" connections. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Safire</ENAMEX>'s
source was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Comrade Criminal</ENAMEX> , a book about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Russian Mafia</ENAMEX> by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Handelman</ENAMEX> that was available <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> before the fund-raiser
at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hay</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adams</ENAMEX> to which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Loutchansky</ENAMEX> was given the invitation that was then
withdrawn. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DNC</ENAMEX> could have spared itself the need for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSA</ENAMEX> intercepts by
reading the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> or visiting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX>.

            
But the larger irony of this turn in the
scandal is that when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Woodward</ENAMEX> wrote his story, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clintonites</ENAMEX> were still being
beaten up in the press for not having communicated similar information
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> bad <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> trying to sidle up to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A month earlier</TIMEX>,
the hot new revelation in the scandal was that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> at the National
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Security Council</ENAMEX> had neglected to pass on to their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">superiors</ENAMEX> the contents of a
briefing by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>, who warned that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> might be
trying to funnel money into the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> campaign. Incidentally, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX>-influence story had been broken by the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Woodward</ENAMEX>.

            What would have constituted
proper handling of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> disclosure to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSC</ENAMEX>? Presumably the same type of
procedure that draws bitter denunciations in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Loutchansky</ENAMEX> episode. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSC</ENAMEX>
might have told <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>, some of whom were supervising fund
raising for the campaign, to be on the lookout for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> bearing gifts. For
this warning to be effective, those <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> would have had to tip
off the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DNC</ENAMEX>, which was soliciting the money directly. In a separate but related
episode, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> has been pilloried for failing to heed exactly such
a warning from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> about <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Johnny Chung</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX>-connected "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">hustler</ENAMEX>"
who got <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> into the taping of a radio address by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>.

            "You
really are damned if you do and damned if you don't," says <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> anonymous source
quoted in the most recent <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Woodward</ENAMEX> story. It's good of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Woodward</ENAMEX> to acknowledge
this irony--if briefly. A more prominent quote--from "<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX>"--is
less sympathetic to the double bind that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clintonites</ENAMEX> now find themselves
in. "This was top secret, and it further demonstrates the total politicization
of all intelligence and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX>. Anything and everything was
done in the name of fund-raising." Had <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Loutchansky</ENAMEX> got to see the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Woodward</ENAMEX> would probably have written a story about lax screening procedures at
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>.

            In fact, this story was written, though not by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Woodward</ENAMEX>. In
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tim Weiner</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> reported that the
administration was no longer using vetting procedures put in place by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> to keep foreign ghouls away from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>. "In their eagerness to
raise campaign money, [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DNC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>] invited <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fund-raisers</ENAMEX>--including <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>'s biggest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arms merchant</ENAMEX>, favor-seeking <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indonesian</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">businessmen</ENAMEX>, a reputed <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mobster</ENAMEX> and other dubiously credentialed
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dealmakers</ENAMEX>--to meet with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weiner</ENAMEX> writes. "Nor did the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>
check the suitability of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> invited by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democratic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Committee</ENAMEX>
to meet the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX>, allowing, among others, a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">twice</NUMEX>-convicted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">felon</ENAMEX> to sip
coffee with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>." The procedure <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weiner</ENAMEX> complains was dropped was
essentially what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Woodward</ENAMEX> complains happened with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Loutchansky</ENAMEX>.

            The most
vociferous journalistic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> preach it round or preach it
flat when it comes to these kinds of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contacts</ENAMEX>. The Wall Street

               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal 's</ENAMEX> editorials now oscillate between accusations that the
administration abused sensitive information on the one hand, and allegations
that it ignored intelligence warnings on the other. Safire, too, has ricocheted
between lambasting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> for abusing quasi-independent
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intelligence</ENAMEX> and law-enforcement <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>, and blasting it for ignoring
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intelligence</ENAMEX> so it could raise gobs of money. In the case of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSC China</ENAMEX>
warning, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Safire</ENAMEX> thinks that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX> behaved too cautiously
because it didn't wish to tip off <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> lurking inside the
administration.

            
So what's a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>--or an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">general</ENAMEX>--to do? <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Safire</ENAMEX> suggests that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Janet Reno</ENAMEX> should have asked to see the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> alone, "warned him unequivocally of the penetration, enlisted his aid
in the investigation--or, if she thought it necessary, read him his rights."
Read him his rights for what crime? Being a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spy</ENAMEX>? That bit of hysteria
aside, it's not hard to imagine <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Safire</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal</ENAMEX> waxing apoplectic
if the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney general</ENAMEX> had asked for a private meeting to warn the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> would surely have portrayed such a meeting as a
corrupt politicization of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX>, reminded us again of the
misuse of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Travelgate</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Filegate</ENAMEX>, and called once more for an
independent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counsel</ENAMEX>.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> administration
has done plenty to fuel suspicion of all kinds. But at some point, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">skeptics</ENAMEX>
have to choose: Did the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clintonites</ENAMEX> abuse power by trafficking in classified
information or by ignoring it? You can't commit both crimes--or, at least, not
at the same time.
