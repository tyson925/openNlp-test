            We are
pleased to introduce, as of sometime <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Aug. 22</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate Search 2.0</ENAMEX>--a new,
improved version of our search function. In addition to a normal text search of
the entire site, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate Search 2.0</ENAMEX> will allow you to:

            Search all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate</ENAMEX> articles,
present and past;

            Search for articles by a
particular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>, or get a list of all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX>;

            Search for articles in a
particular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX>, or get a list of all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">departments</ENAMEX>;

            Search
for articles that ran on or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">around</NUMEX> a particular date.

            A simplified search function
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate Search Lite</ENAMEX>) will appear on the bottom of every new page <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">from now</TIMEX> on,
and the full-featured search is available on the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Search Page</ENAMEX>. There is
also a page of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Search Hints</ENAMEX>.

            In short,
you no longer have an excuse not to explore the riches of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate</ENAMEX>, past and
present, whenever the need arises for insight on any aspect of the human
condition. Please give it a try.

            
               But Wait.
There's <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">More</ENAMEX>!

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> (that is, our development <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> that is crack, not our team
developing crack) is hard at work on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate Search</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.0</NUMEX>. This upgrade will allow
you to:

            Search for words that rhyme
with a particular word, or get a list of all words;

particular ideological slant or cultural preference (such as a prejudice

            Search for articles by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> who have been divorced, have red <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hair</ENAMEX>, or voted <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> in at least
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> but not <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than five of the past six</TIMEX> presidential elections;

            Search for condescension,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sentimentality</ENAMEX>, irony (with separate options for intentional and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unintentional</ENAMEX>), pandering, obscurantism, and puns;

            Search for hidden codes that
prove the existence of God;

            Search for "<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">666</NUMEX>," hotlinks to

            Search for
obsequious references to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Gates</ENAMEX>.

            This will be a marvelous new
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tool</ENAMEX>, produced by a marvelous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>. Is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Gates</ENAMEX> a great <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX>, or what?
