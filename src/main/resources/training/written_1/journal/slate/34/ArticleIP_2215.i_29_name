            How many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> read

                  Slate
               ? <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last August</TIMEX>, in a "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Webhead"</ENAMEX> column by our then-Program
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Manager</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Barnes</ENAMEX>, we attempted to answer that question, while at the same
time explaining why any claims about the popularity of Web sites are inherently
suspicious. With that same caveat, we offer an update. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August</TIMEX>, we were
serving an average of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 90,000</NUMEX> pages <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a day</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven days a week</TIMEX>. In recent
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX>, we have been serving <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 140,000</NUMEX> pages <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a day</TIMEX>. As that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Webhead</ENAMEX> column
explained, the design of a site can drastically affect the page count. (A Web
"page" is of no fixed size, and the same <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">material</ENAMEX> can take few or many pages.)
We think a better measure is "unique browsers": the number of individual
computers that visit a site. (Each computer is counted just once, no matter how
many times it visits.) In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the month of August</TIMEX>, we had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 80,000</NUMEX> individual
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> by this measure. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the month of November</TIMEX>, we had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">close to 140,000</NUMEX>.
This doesn't count the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22,000</NUMEX> who get 
                  Slate
                delivered by e-mail
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every Friday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> (if you wanna sign up, click here), or the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> who get e-mail delivery of "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Today's Papers</ENAMEX>"
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five days a week</TIMEX> (click here to sign up).

            Why the growth? Naturally
we'd like to attribute it to our excellent editorial product and to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">kindness</ENAMEX> and enthusiasm of 
                  Slate
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> in spreading the word.
But we suspect that other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> are at work as well. There's the steady
increase in the number of Internet <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX>, who nonetheless account for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">barely 15</TIMEX>
percent of the adult <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. And there's the particular boost

                  Slate
                has been getting from our beloved distribution <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partners</ENAMEX>:
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">America Online, Hotmail</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft Network</ENAMEX>. To whomever we owe thanks,
thanks!

            And if
you're one of our new arrivals, welcome.

            
               New
Stuff
            

            

               
                  Slate
                continues to be an experiment in magazine journalism on the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Web</ENAMEX>. We try things--sometimes they work, sometimes they don't. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">This week</TIMEX> we
inaugurate no <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fewer than three</NUMEX> new features:

            "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Reply All</ENAMEX>" is an
update on the old-fashioned epistolary novel (fiction in the form of letters,
such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Les Liaisons Dangereuses</ENAMEX> , the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1782</TIMEX> novel by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Choderlos de Laclos</ENAMEX>
that was turned into a play and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different movies <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few years ago</TIMEX>). Our
version is fiction in the form of e-mail among <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX>: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>, one in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>, and one in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bay Area</ENAMEX>. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX>'s mail is
written by an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> in that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. In another throwback to earlier forms, Reply
All will be written and published in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekly</TIMEX> installments. <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 1</ENAMEX> is posted
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">now</TIMEX>.

            "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International</ENAMEX>
Papers" is a worldwide version of our popular <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Today's Papers</ENAMEX>
column, synthesizing and commenting on what leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX> outside the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX> are saying about the major news stories (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Gore</ENAMEX> was a bust in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kyoto</ENAMEX>, apparently), and noting stories that are being ignored in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX> but loom large elsewhere. (Did you know, for example, about the
beauty-queen boom in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> or the controversy about transsexual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">athletes</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australia</ENAMEX>?) At least for now, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Papers</ENAMEX> will be updated just twice a
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week</TIMEX>, on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> evenings, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PST</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alexander Chancellor</ENAMEX>,
a distinguished <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">columnist</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guardian</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> and former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX>
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spectator</ENAMEX> . By its nature (not to mention <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander</ENAMEX>'s nature),
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Papers</ENAMEX> will be less structured than <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Today's Papers</ENAMEX>. Rather than
analyzing the same <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> front pages <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX>, it will flit around the world,
courtesy of the Internet, looking for trends and patterns. The language barrier
will be a challenge, but our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> is about as well qualified as anyone to
take it on. Although he doesn't know much <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Urdu</ENAMEX>, he is fluent in
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX>. Oh yes, and a bit of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>.

            "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Cheat Sheet</ENAMEX>" is a
spinoff of the "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Hackathlon</ENAMEX>" (see below). It is on tryout as a replacement for "The
Gist." We're looking for ways to bring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> quickly and painlessly up to
speed on issues in the news they haven't followed closely, or have found
confusing, or--frankly--are bored by but feel guilty about it. For the
Hackathlon, a hack writing contest for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalists</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Deputy Editor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Shafer</ENAMEX>
provided a "cheat
sheet" of information the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">contestants</ENAMEX> could draw upon in each of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
rounds. The cheat sheets were so entertaining and informative that we thought
we'd try this form as a regular feature. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>, about the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arlington</ENAMEX>
Cemetery flap, is posted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">now</TIMEX>.

            As part of the ebb and flow of 
                  Slate
               
features, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> have concluded their runs. Don't miss <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</TIMEX>'s breathtaking
conclusion to "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Doodlennium</ENAMEX>," the cartoon saga of the chicken <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark Alan</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stamaty</ENAMEX>. (And of course, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the entire year</TIMEX>-and-a-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-long series is available in
"The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Compost</ENAMEX>.")
Liberated from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Doodlennium</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark</ENAMEX> will have an expanded role in illustrating the
rest of 
                  Slate
               . (Check out his drawing of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robin Williams</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matt</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Damon</ENAMEX> in "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Summary Judgment</ENAMEX>.") "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Varnish Remover</ENAMEX>," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Shrum</ENAMEX>'s analysis of a
TV commercial, has been suspended to allow <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bob</ENAMEX> to concentrate on whatever it is
he does exactly as an international political and business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultant</ENAMEX>. But
he'll be back, we hope, either with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Varnish Remover</ENAMEX> or some new feature, closer
to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next fall</TIMEX>'s elections.

            
               More New
Stuff
            

            We need
your help with another new feature that starts <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next week</TIMEX>. It is an advice
column, called "Dear <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudence</ENAMEX>." Although the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> stands prepared to answer
questions on any topic, she is better qualified to share wisdom about morals
and manners, what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youth</ENAMEX> can learn from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX>, and macroeconomic policy than about
how to get your brand-new, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#$#</NUMEX>@<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">%&</ENAMEX>! <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$200</NUMEX> fax modem to work properly. Please
send your inquiries to prudence@slate.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">com</ENAMEX>.

            The first
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> 
                  Slate
                "Hackathlon" is over, after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">four</TIMEX>
not-especially-grueling <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> not-really-so-hackish <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hacks</ENAMEX>. And the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> have rendered their verdict. The New 
               <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">York</ENAMEX> 
               Times
now has another honor to add to its string of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pulitzers</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Specter</ENAMEX>, a
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moscow</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">correspondent</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> , was judged to be the biggest hack by
a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37</NUMEX>-percent plurality of 
                  Slate
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malcolm Gladwell</ENAMEX> of
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Yorker</ENAMEX> came in <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">27 percent</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalist</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Geoffrey Wheatcroft</ENAMEX>, representing the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> that invented hack journalism and
whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalists</ENAMEX> still pride themselves on maintaining their lack of
standards, got a disappointing <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">19 percent</NUMEX>. And <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hanna Rosin</ENAMEX> of the New

               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Republic</ENAMEX> came in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last</TIMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">17 percent</NUMEX>. But she's young: She has plenty
of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> yet in which to compromise her integrity. For more details and
analysis of this historic sporting event, go to the Hackathlon
itself.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Man Who Ate Everything</ENAMEX>, by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeffrey Steingarten</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Knopf</ENAMEX>). This
is a collection of hilarious and informative essays by the food <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critic</ENAMEX> of
Vogue . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only one</NUMEX> of the pieces included comes from 
                  Slate
               .
But it is the title essay.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Degas</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Orleans</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Encounters in the Creole World of Kate</ENAMEX>

tale of an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1872</TIMEX> visit by the Impressionist <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painter</ENAMEX> to the relentlessly colorful
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Louisiana</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Benfey</ENAMEX> is 
                  Slate
               's art <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critic</ENAMEX>.

and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meaning of Life</ENAMEX>, by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven E. Landsburg</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Free Press</ENAMEX>). Landsburg
writes the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</TIMEX> "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Everyday Economics"</ENAMEX> column for 
                  Slate
               , and
several of the essays in this collection <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> appeared here. (In fact, you can
still read them here.)

            <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Trail Fever</ENAMEX>, by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Lewis</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Knopf</ENAMEX>). Tales of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>
presidential race by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> who is now exploring the new <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> economy
in 
                  Slate
               's "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Millionerds"</ENAMEX> column.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Factory of Facts</ENAMEX>, by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Luc Sante</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Knopf</ENAMEX>). This is a memoir
about growing up in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Belgium</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> by the prominent cultural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critic</ENAMEX> who
writes often for 
                  Slate
               . It actually doesn't come out until
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February</TIMEX>, but you could always buy a gift certificate.

            

               
                  Slate
                is pleased to have supplied so many outstanding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> to
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House of Knopf</ENAMEX>, and looks forward to a seasonal fruit basket. Actually, an
ad or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> would go down well. For <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> who (like the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX>) found the
mental exercise in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven Landsburg</ENAMEX>'s most recent "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Everyday Economics</ENAMEX>"
column a bit hard to follow, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve</ENAMEX> tries a different version in
"E-Mail to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Editors</ENAMEX>" (scroll down to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> e-mail message and read his
response). You might find it more satisfying. We did.

Corrections: 
                  Slate
               's "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">In Other Magazines"</ENAMEX> column incorrectly said
that The 
               New 
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yorker</ENAMEX> said that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> calls
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Attorney General</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reno</ENAMEX> "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Martian</ENAMEX>" behind her back. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Yorker</ENAMEX>
actually said that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aides</ENAMEX> call her this. Also, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>
columnist spells his name <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rowland Evans</ENAMEX>, not <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roland</ENAMEX> as 
                  Slate
               's
"<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pundit Central</ENAMEX>" alleged <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX>.

            
               Dear
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudence</ENAMEX>:
            

            I am just
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill</ENAMEX> being pursued by a gal named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Janet</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Janet</ENAMEX> was also pursuing
another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill</ENAMEX>, but he somehow or other put her off the scent. She's
stopped chasing him, but she's still chasing me! Neither of us appreciates her
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">attentions</ENAMEX>. What I want to know is, why does she have this vendetta against
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill</ENAMEX>? And how did the other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> manage to lose her? What has he got
that I don't got? Is life unfair, or what?

            
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sincerely</ENAMEX>,
