               UI Like,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UI</ENAMEX> Don't Like
            

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">bits</NUMEX> of software
jargon the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalists</ENAMEX> at 
                  Slate
                have learned at <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">the feet</NUMEX> of our
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cybercolleagues</ENAMEX> is "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user interface</ENAMEX>," or "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">UI</ENAMEX>" for short. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UI</ENAMEX> is the face the
software presents to the world--the set of devices (buttons to click, blanks to
fill in, and so on) by which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> are able to tell the software what to do.
(As a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>, 
                  Slate
                takes no position on what
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> should do when they want to tell the software where to go.)

            Here at

                  Slate
                we've been having a, er, vigorous discussion about one
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">particular UI</ENAMEX> issue. It concerns our e-mail-type features. Currently we do
these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different ways. "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dispatches & Dialogues</ENAMEX>," such as "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Movies Today</ENAMEX>,"
uses an elaborate and (some of us think) elegant UI: Each discussion has an
introductory page, each entry is on its own page, and (if you accept <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cookies</ENAMEX>)
your computer remembers which item you last read and takes you to the next item
when you return the next time. "The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Breakfast Table</ENAMEX>" and "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Chatterbox</ENAMEX>" employ a
simpler and (some of us think) more elegant or possibly (others of us think)
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cruder</ENAMEX> UI: New items are just piled on top of older ones until, after a day or
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a week</TIMEX>, a new page is started.

            Atotally objective summary of the internal debate is
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">roughly</NUMEX> as follows:

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Advocates</ENAMEX> of the simpler
approach argue that it more closely captures the fizz of e-mail, is easier and
quicker for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX>, and encourages the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> to really think of the
process as a conversation rather than as a series of isolated pronunciamentos.
(This contingent is itself divided on the issue of newest-to-oldest vs.
oldest-to-newest, but that's a whole other debate.)

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Advocates</ENAMEX> of the complicated
approach emphasize that some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> enjoy constantly clicking and waiting
because they have nothing better to do; that long and boring doesn't
necessarily mean bad; that cool technology is its own justification even if
it's useless; and that, anyway, who cares what the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> want.

            The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX>, of course, is scrupulously neutral in this controversy.

            Care to take <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sides</ENAMEX>? Your vote
below will be appreciated--if not necessarily followed. And you can check on
the tally any time by returning to this page. You can also e-mail comments on
this or any other issue to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX>@slate.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">com</ENAMEX>. Thanks.
