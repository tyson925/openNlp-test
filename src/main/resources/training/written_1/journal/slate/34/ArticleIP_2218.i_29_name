Chick, There a Chick
            

            The world
is in a panic over <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">chickens</ENAMEX>. A few of these <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> may be
responsible for a new strain of flu that could produce a global pandemic on the
order of the one that killed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1918</TIMEX>. Or so the arriviste
chickophobes of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> are clucking. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Followers</ENAMEX> of a certain feature in

                  Slate
               , however, have long been aware of the threat posed by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">chickens</ENAMEX> to humanity's health and well-being. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark Alan Stamaty</ENAMEX>'s recently
concluded comic strip, "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Doodlennium</ENAMEX>," has been a lone voice in the wilderness
warning against <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">chickens</ENAMEX>. The entire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Doodlennium</ENAMEX> chicken saga is in "The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Compost</ENAMEX>." <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cluck</ENAMEX> here, we mean, click here, to review the story before it's too late.

            
               Dear Dear
Prudence
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dear Prudence</ENAMEX>, our new
advice
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">columnist</ENAMEX>, has been overwhelmed by the number of 
                  Slate
               sters
seeking her wisdom on a range of matters. 
                  Slate
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sters</ENAMEX> appear to
know almost nothing about how to behave in virtually any social or ethical
situation, so it is fortunate that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudence</ENAMEX> has arrived to enlighten us. But
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudence</ENAMEX> has a problem. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> e-mail her wishing to comment on her comments. To publish these
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">metacomments</ENAMEX> in her column would create <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> difficulties. First, it would take
up space that could otherwise be devoted to solving additional problems of the
world. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, it would tarnish the sheen of infallibility to which any advice
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">columnist</ENAMEX> is entitled--and which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudence</ENAMEX>, among all of them, most deserves.
Our <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solution</ENAMEX>? A new thread in "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Fray</ENAMEX>" devoted to discussion of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudence</ENAMEX>
and her advice. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fray</ENAMEX> is, of course, a very cauldron of moral relativism. It
exists to be nonjudgmental. Issues can--indeed, must--remain unsettled
indefinitely. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dear Prudence</ENAMEX>, by contrast, must radiate moral absolutism and be
judgmental in the extreme. Her word is law.
