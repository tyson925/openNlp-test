               A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Week</ENAMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Silence</ENAMEX>
            

            We
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">confess</ENAMEX> to a moment of doubt about our genteel policy of a week off every now
and then when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Princess</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Di</ENAMEX> was killed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> after our most recent skipped week
began. When <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The New Yorker</ENAMEX> (which also skips an issue or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> each
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>) chose to rush out a special <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Princess</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Di</ENAMEX> issue <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several days early</TIMEX>, we felt
especially heartsick. Were we the only media outlet that squandered this
opportunity to exploit the public's revulsion at media exploitation of the dead
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">princess</ENAMEX>? (For a tour <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">d'horizon</ENAMEX> of the magazine coverage, see "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">In Other Magazines</ENAMEX>.")
Could we not have profitably run a few symposiums on privacy vs. press freedom,
personal reflections on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">celebrity</ENAMEX> culture, editorials condemning the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">paparazzi</ENAMEX> ? But we decided, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end</TIMEX>, that a week of silence was
actually a fitting tribute to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diana</ENAMEX>--or, at least, that it was the only fully
satisfactory response to complaints about media exploitation. Now that the week
is over, don't miss <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Plotz</ENAMEX>'s "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Assessment</ENAMEX>" of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diana</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> and eulogizer, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Earl Spencer</ENAMEX>.

            
               Vote
Early and Often
            

            Starting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, you can take
sides in all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate</ENAMEX>'s current "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dialogues</ENAMEX>." Each Dialogue will feature buttons
with which you can record your support for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> side or the other. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">page</ENAMEX> will
display a running vote count, expressed in percentage terms. And the polls
never close: The tally will continue indefinitely, even after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dialogue</ENAMEX> has
been <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Composted</ENAMEX>. You can only vote once (you have to register), but you can
change your vote as often as you like as the Dialogue proceeds. This reflects
our hope that these Dialogues will be exercises in reasoned persuasion, and not
repeated fusillades from fixed positions. The test of a successful argument
will be less a matter of who gets the most votes than of who changes the
most votes.

            And please
note, if you haven't already, the arrival of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Explorer</ENAMEX>, a new way to
explore and navigate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate</ENAMEX>'s contents. It's a cute little box that sits on your
Windows <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">95</NUMEX> desktop and does many remarkable things. Click here for a

               We Wuz
Misquoted
            

            It's an
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">old</ENAMEX> story. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daily</ENAMEX> Newsprint reviewer writes that <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Titanic II</ENAMEX>: The
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Kitchen Sink</ENAMEX> is "a spectacular failure," and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">producer</ENAMEX> buys ads
declaring, " 'Spectacular'--the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daily</ENAMEX> Newsprint ." Well, not all bad
habits start out in cyberspace and spread to traditional media--sometimes it
happens the other way. In a recent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate</ENAMEX> review of Web filtering software (intended to help
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> control what sites their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> have access to), our reviewer, Nell
Minow, said of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> such product, "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Parents</ENAMEX> who are willing to devote the time to
setting their own parameters will be better off with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cyber Patrol</ENAMEX>." <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Cyber</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Patrol</ENAMEX>'s Web site does some creative filtering and declares, "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate</ENAMEX> says that
of all the Internet filters, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> are 'better off with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cyber Patrol</ENAMEX>.' " A
rival, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">SurfWatch</ENAMEX>, has complained, and rightly so.
