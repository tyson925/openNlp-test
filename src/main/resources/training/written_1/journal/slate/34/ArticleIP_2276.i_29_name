            If you want to understand
the bitter debate over rent control that now dominates social interaction in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>, you have to begin by ignoring arguments about social <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">justice</ENAMEX>, market
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">economics</ENAMEX>, and all appeals to principle. Instead, apply crude <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Marxist</ENAMEX> dogma:
It's a battle of naked <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> interest. The catch is that the "classes"
glowering at each other across the barricades aren't rich and poor. They're the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">New Yorkers</ENAMEX> with scandalously sweet deals vs. all those who get screwed as a
result.

            Recent
experience has done much to reinforce my own class consciousness as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of
the latter <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> and I were minding our own business in an unregulated
apartment in the rapidly gentrifying <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Village</ENAMEX> when we returned from work
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX> to a letter informing us that our already (to non-New <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Yorkers</ENAMEX>) alarming
rent of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1,950</NUMEX> was going up <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$700</NUMEX>. That's for a largish <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-bedroom in a
marginal neighborhood. This catapulted us into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manhattan</ENAMEX>-real-estate hell, a
place where rapacious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">brokers</ENAMEX> extract usurious commissions on glorified broom
closets renting for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2,300</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a month</TIMEX>. We lucked out, relatively speaking. Thanks
to a connection, we fell into a nice, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2,000</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-bedroom in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chelsea</ENAMEX>, without
paying a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">finder</ENAMEX>'s fee. Absent the artificial shortage created by rent
regulation, we would either have a bigger place or pay much less for the one
we've got.

            The moral and economic arguments against rent control are
pretty much unassailable. Under the present system, government intervenes in
the market to protect a class of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> defined to some extent by long-term
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">residency</ENAMEX>, but to an even larger extent by luck. This massive intrusion in the
real-estate market, which might be hard to justify even if it had purely
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">beneficial</ENAMEX> consequences, has a number of obviously disastrous ones. It deters
young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX> from moving to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York City</ENAMEX>; it encourages
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">landlords</ENAMEX> to neglect their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>; it makes them hate their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tenants</ENAMEX>. But
even as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victim</ENAMEX> of this misbegotten system, I hope <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Bruno</ENAMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> who has been threatening to let all the rules
expire on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 15</TIMEX>, cuts a deal to let rent control continue a little longer.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York City</ENAMEX> is a highly complex, weirdly evolved <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX>--kind of like a
pickled old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">codger</ENAMEX> living on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gin</ENAMEX> and cigarettes: He should have started
behaving more sensibly a long time ago, but forcing him to suddenly do it now
would be an act of cruelty, more likely to kill him than to make him
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">healthier</ENAMEX>.

            What would
happen if rent regulations were really abolished? It's a pretty safe bet that
in most parts of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manhattan</ENAMEX>, market rents would settle in somewhere between the
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2,000</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a month</TIMEX> I pay and the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$600</NUMEX> that others pay for nearly identical
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartments</ENAMEX> in the same <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>. Using the estimates promoted by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rent</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stabilization Association</ENAMEX> (the newspeak name for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> representing
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">landlords</ENAMEX> who actually wish to end rent stabilization), the typical
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-bedroom in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Village</ENAMEX> or on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Upper West Side</ENAMEX> might go for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1,300</NUMEX> to
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1,400</NUMEX> after the shakeout. A rent like that calls for a pretax income of at
least <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$50,000</NUMEX>. Once you figure in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York City</ENAMEX> and state taxes, a more
realistic figure would be <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$60,000</NUMEX>. A <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-bedroom <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX> suitable for raising
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> in might cost only a bit over <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2,000</NUMEX>, which would demand an income of
at least <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$90,000</NUMEX>. These are conservative estimates; I find it hard to imagine
bargains like that being freely available, even in a totally deregulated
market.

            
The poor, who are subsidized directly, and are
likely to be exempted even in the case of radical decontrol, would stay put.
What <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manhattan</ENAMEX> would lose is what remains of its middle class, those earning
between <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$25,000</NUMEX> and, say, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$75,000</NUMEX>. This would mean a tremendous blow to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>'s social variety and cultural vitality. Gone would be the used-bookstore
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owner</ENAMEX>, the public-school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> that's been in the same <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Upper West</ENAMEX>
Side <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">100 years</TIMEX>, the office <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> (a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> I actually know) who
attends every performance of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metropolitan Opera</ENAMEX>. Without protection for
those marginal, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cosmopolitan souls</ENAMEX> who cling to it tenuously, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manhattan</ENAMEX> would
become much more the way <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who don't live here imagine it, a soulless
playground for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">yuppies</ENAMEX>, with an alienated underclass underfoot. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> would
become more rational and less charming--more like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX>, less like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX>. The
irony is that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">yuppies</ENAMEX> who would benefit financially from the end of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rent-control</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> would probably like living here much less without it.

            Decontrol
would also make <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> uglier. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the big points made by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponents</ENAMEX> of
rent control is that the present system prevents the construction of new
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>. Because rent regulations say you can't evict <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> when their
leases are up (if they even have leases), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> obstinate tenement dweller can
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">block</ENAMEX> the creation of a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>-story high-rise. But who wants new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manhattan</ENAMEX>? What an apartment <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> looks like--on the outside--affects
everybody, not just the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">landlord</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tenant</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>'s old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> are
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gracious</ENAMEX> and charming, even those that are run-down. Its new ones--at least
those of the residential variety--are generally horrible. It is rent control
that has preserved the aesthetic as well as the social fabric of the kind of
variegated, low-rise neighborhoods <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jane Jacobs</ENAMEX> celebrated in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Death and</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Life of Great American Cities</ENAMEX> , which in many other places were knocked down
to make way for high-rise development. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manhattan</ENAMEX>, again like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX>, should be
regarded as largely finished.

            In all likelihood, there will be a compromise on rent
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX>. Let's hope it's not like the "luxury decontrol" compromise in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>,
when everyone agreed to end controls for those with incomes <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">over $250,000</NUMEX>,
whose <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartments</ENAMEX> rented for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">over $2,000</NUMEX>. Both conditions apply, which means
that if you earn <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$8 million</NUMEX>, and your <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX>-room <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Central Park West</ENAMEX>
only costs <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$847</NUMEX>, you get away unmolested. Rent-control <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defenders</ENAMEX> stick up for
the worst excesses of the system on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Realpolitik</ENAMEX> grounds; they want the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rich</ENAMEX> on their side in the fight to keep the whole shebang. But given the
outrage such excesses generate, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocates</ENAMEX> would be better off cutting the rich
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">loose</ENAMEX> and gaining a modicum of redistributive equity for their side of the
argument. Any sane <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> has to be against rent control after hearing about
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bernard-Alexis Poisson de Menars</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">marquis</ENAMEX> who <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few years ago</TIMEX> was
reported by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsday</ENAMEX> to be paying <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$103.50</NUMEX> a month for a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">duplex</ENAMEX> on the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Upper East Side</ENAMEX> that he didn't even live in. When his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">landlord</ENAMEX> tried to lure
him into a smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX> in the same neighborhood, he insisted that it
would not befit a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> of his "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> and social <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">station</ENAMEX>." This time, the
"luxury" threshold will probably be scaled back, while exempting anyone over
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">62</TIMEX>, regardless of income. Surely there should be an exemption for middle- and
lower-income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elderly</ENAMEX>. But why should <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alistair Cooke</ENAMEX> get to keep hogging those
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Fifth Avenue</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2,078</NUMEX>? If he wants all that space, let him pay
for it.

            
The goal of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rent-</ENAMEX>regulation compromise should
be to diminish unfairness and mitigate perverse side effects without giving a
shock to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>'s social system. This argues for a fairly straightforward
means test for rent control, say <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$100,000</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX>. There will be <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, some of
them elderly, who make <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $100,000</NUMEX> but still can't afford the rents
their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartments</ENAMEX> could command on the free market. They will have to move. How
big a tragedy is that?

            The other essential reform
is "vacancy decontrol," which would allow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">landlords</ENAMEX> to charge market rent when
apartments empty. (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Tenant groups</ENAMEX> argue that this gives <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">landlords</ENAMEX> an incentive
to harass <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tenants</ENAMEX>. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">landlords</ENAMEX> have plenty of incentive to harass tenants
now, since they're already allowed to raise the rent somewhat when an apartment
changes hands.) The intergenerational handing down of rent-controlled
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">apartments</ENAMEX>, which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gov.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Pataki</ENAMEX> favors, perhaps on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Republican</ENAMEX>
principle that no form of inherited wealth is bad, should also disappear. These
reforms would mean that rent control would evanesce over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next 30 or 40</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>. It would be <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nicorette</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>'s neighborhoods, instead of cold
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">turkey</ENAMEX>.
