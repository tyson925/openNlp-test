               If It's

            On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday, Nov. 4</TIMEX>, we
unveil the latest version of our contents or home page. (Maybe even a day or
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sooner if 
                  Slate
               's hearty software <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">developers</ENAMEX> are willing to
suspend their centuries-old common-law right to a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three-hour</TIMEX> lunch break,
double helpings of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Caesar salad</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salmon hash</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.3</NUMEX> liters of a tolerable
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">sauvignon blanc</ENAMEX>, followed by a nap of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">at least two hours</TIMEX>' duration. As provided
in the ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Codewriters' Code</ENAMEX> , which dates back to ancient
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sumeria</ENAMEX>--or is it <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sumatra</ENAMEX>?--<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> is forbidden to wake them but may send
them back to their computers if they awaken by natural means before closing
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>.) Where was I? Oh yes, our new contents page. We hope you like it. It's
intended to be simpler and clearer, to require less scrolling, and to draw more
attention to our "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Back of the Book</ENAMEX>" culture section. This new page is not to be
confused with our (also fairly new) Internet <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Explorer 4.0</ENAMEX> contents page,
designed to take advantage of the capabilities of the Internet <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Explorer</ENAMEX> 4.0
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">browser</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Users</ENAMEX> of that browser can choose the version they prefer. And those of
any browser, race, or creed who prefer our "by date" contents page, which lists
all current 
                  Slate
                articles and features in reverse chronological
order--i.e., <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s new stuff on top, then <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX>'s, and so on--can still
get that one, too.

            Future
offerings will include tables of contents sorted alphabetically (by title, by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>, by opening sentence), by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>'s height (or religion or preference in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">beers</ENAMEX>), by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX>'s confidential opinion of the article's merits, by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bill</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gates</ENAMEX>' opinion of the article's merits, by the amount the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> was paid, and
by the number of appearances of the phrase "irrational exuberance" or
"distinguishing characteristic." (No article has appeared in any publication
for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least six months</TIMEX> without either of these phrases.) Have we forgotten
your preference? Just let us know. We hope ultimately to have a unique table of
contents configured to the taste of every 
                  Slate
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reader</ENAMEX>.

            
               <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX>'s
Economic Puzzler
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven E. Landsburg</ENAMEX>, who
writes 
                  Slate
               's "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Everyday Economics"</ENAMEX> column, has a new book out called
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fair</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Play: What Your Child Can Teach You About Economics, Values</ENAMEX>, and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meaning of Life</ENAMEX> . Click here to order it from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publisher</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Free Press</ENAMEX>.
Several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapters</ENAMEX> originated as columns in 
                  Slate
               . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve</ENAMEX>
specializes in delightful explanations of apparent economic anomalies, so he
surely can explain why ordering this excellent volume directly from the
publisher costs the full price of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$24</NUMEX> plus shipping and handling, while a
bookstore with vast overheads of real estate and espresso machines will sell it
to you at a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10-percent or 20-percent</NUMEX> discount.
