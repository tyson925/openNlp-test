               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mo</ENAMEX>' Beta
Slate
            

            Slate proudly announces
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Slate Explorer</ENAMEX>, a new way to navigate through the delights of slate.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">com</ENAMEX>. (So
why didn't we name it <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate Navigator</ENAMEX> ? We dunno. Explorer just seemed
more euphonious, somehow.) We think it's pretty darn cool (a technical
software industry term, used to imply strong feelings of affirmation), and hope
you will as well. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Click</ENAMEX> here for instructions on how to download <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Explorer</ENAMEX>.)

            And what is <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Slate Explorer</ENAMEX>?
It's a poem, an ice cream cone on a hot <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer day</TIMEX>, the smell of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Styrofoam</ENAMEX> when
you crack open that box containing your new computer. It's ... well, it's a
small program, actually, that puts a small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">box</ENAMEX> on your Windows desktop. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sorry</ENAMEX>,
it doesn't work on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macs</ENAMEX>. Yes, we know, we know. ... But to be fair, it doesn't
work on Windows <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.1</NUMEX> either. It does work on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Windows 95</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Windows NT 4.0</ENAMEX>.)
Click on the little arrow, and the box expands horizontally into a list of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate</ENAMEX>'s major categories (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Briefing, Columns & Features, Back of the Book</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dispatches & Dialogues</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Utilities</ENAMEX>). Click on a category, and it expands
vertically into a list of current contents. Click on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of these listings, and
the article will appear.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Slate Explorer</ENAMEX> works, in
most cases, even when you're not online. When you select an article, the
program will launch your browser and initiate a Web connection. When you are
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">online, Slate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Explorer</ENAMEX> will automatically update itself, even if--for some
inexplicable reason--you're not reading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate</ENAMEX> at the moment. It's all a bit
hard to explain, but fun to try.

            Now, listen carefully. This
is a beta release of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Explorer</ENAMEX>. "Beta" is a software industry term
for a product that is perhaps just a teensy bit short of absolute perfection,
but is being released anyway because we just can't wait anymore--or rather,
because we want to let the software-using community share in the excitement of
finding any last-minute bugs. We're reasonably sure that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Slate Explorer</ENAMEX> won't
cause your computer to explode, or to charge large sums to your <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Visa</ENAMEX> card, or
to take up <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">smoking</ENAMEX>, or to insult a police <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX>. But we make no
guarantees.

            For the
moment, this beta release is only being promoted in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Readme</ENAMEX>--that is, to our
most loyal and discerning <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> (who are also immune to crass flattery). If
you do happen to discover a flaw in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Explorer</ENAMEX>, just keep it to yourself,
OK? No, please e-mail us about it at help@slate.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">com</ENAMEX>. But be polite. Remember: This is a beta.

<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Pennies for Your Thoughts</ENAMEX>
            

            How would
you like to get paid to do something you do all the time anyway for zippo? If
we know our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX>, you're full of opinions and don't mind making them known!
So how would you like to spout off a lot of opinions and have perfect <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">strangers</ENAMEX>
take them seriously, even if they make no sense at all ? And get a check
for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$100</NUMEX> in the bargain! Sounds too good to be true? Well, it is, you idiot.
... No, we mean, it isn't , thanks to a wonderful opportunity sponsored
by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate</ENAMEX>'s associate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">publisher</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colene McBeth</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colene</ENAMEX> is looking for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> in a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> round of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> focus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. The
sessions will be held in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early October</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">D.C.</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX>; and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">San</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francisco</ENAMEX> (locations scientifically chosen as reflecting places <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Colene</ENAMEX> likes to
visit). It's your chance to tell us what you think about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate</ENAMEX> and how you
might like to see it improve. And we'll pay you <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$100</NUMEX> for your trouble. If
you're interested, please e-mail <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alice Baker</ENAMEX> at a-abaker@microsoft.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX>, or
call collect ([<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">425</ENAMEX>] <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">882-8080</ENAMEX>, ext. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25848</NUMEX>). If you were in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate</ENAMEX> focus group
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX>, or if your name is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Gates</ENAMEX>, you're not eligible. But if you are
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the many we didn't have room for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> (or if your name was Bill
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gates</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX>, but you've changed it), please feel free to try again.

            

               Traditional Values
            

            Most of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate</ENAMEX> will not be
published <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next week</TIMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> and last of our traditional <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer weeks</TIMEX> off.
(Or at least, we hope to make this a tradition, and have got away with it for
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two summers</TIMEX> so far.) We will, of course, be hard at work throughout the week
for the betterment of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft Corp.</ENAMEX>, and the world, in roughly
that order. Or at least, we'll be thinking occasionally about the betterment of
these fine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX>. And <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scott Shuger</ENAMEX> will be posting "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Today's Papers</ENAMEX>"
early <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">every morning</TIMEX> as usual, except for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Labor Day</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate</ENAMEX> will
return to its normal schedule <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday, Sept. 8</TIMEX>.
