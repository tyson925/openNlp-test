            By <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacob</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Weisberg</ENAMEX>

            It's deep-thoughts time at
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>. Gearing up for his <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Inaugural Address</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Clinton</ENAMEX> has
been trying on themes and buzz phrases like an advertising-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">copywriter</NUMEX>-cum-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pope</ENAMEX>.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last month</TIMEX>, at the annual meeting of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Democratic Leadership Council</ENAMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> spoke of occupying the "vital, dynamic center" of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> politics.
More recently, at a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> prayer breakfast, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> said he wanted to
foster a "spirit of reconciliation" and quoted the late <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Cardinal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bernardin</ENAMEX> to the effect that time is precious and should not be wasted on
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">acrimony</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX>. "The truth is, all of us just have a little bit of time
left," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> told the breakfasting clergymen.

            One
doesn't wish to deny anyone his rightful share of grandiloquence, but there is
a hazard here. It's that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>, who has been showily contemplating his
presidency for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past two months</TIMEX>, will misconceive his <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> term. If he
thinks it's about moral <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX>, or about standing above the hurly-burly of
politics, he's kidding himself. What is portentously called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s "place in
history" will probably depend less on his sounding like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">VÃ¡clav Havel</ENAMEX> than on a
bunch of quotidian issues--what he referred to dismissively in his
prayer-breakfast speech as "balancing the budget and all that."

            This is partly a judgment on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s own strengths and
weaknesses. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> has yet to utter a truly memorable line (if you don't
count "I didn't inhale"). No one looks to him for moral example. He does,
however, understand the fine points of public policy as well as any president
we've had, and is capable of putting the public welfare ahead of narrow
political considerations when it really matters. A few such painful choices
rescued what might otherwise have been a disastrous <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> term. The most
significant of these was his decision to press for deficit reduction instead of
new spending programs in his <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> budget. But there were others, too: His
decision to support <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NAFTA</ENAMEX> and his belated intervention in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bosnia</ENAMEX>. These were
not the areas where he thought he would stake his claim to greatness. Yet, by
making the right decisions on big issues he couldn't avoid, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> salvaged a
record of accomplishment and earned his re-election.

            This time,
the decisions are equally momentous--and probably more difficult. The amount of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">courage Clinton</ENAMEX> displays in acting to reform <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> will
determine whether these successful and popular programs survive into the next
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">century</ENAMEX> in anything resembling their present forms. But the stakes are even
greater than that. Absent significant reform, the escalating costs of these
programs will, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX> to come, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX> out what remains of the federal
"discretionary" budget--the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yosemite</ENAMEX>, and all the rest. As
discretionary programs are trimmed back to pay for mounting entitlement costs,
the possibility of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> or any other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> deploying new programs to
address national problems will become more and more remote. Not acting to
reform entitlements will mean <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> leaving a dysfunctional federal
government behind him when he goes.

            
The most urgent part of the entitlement problem
is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX>. Perhaps more than any other single issue, this won <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> election. And it was not pure "Medi-goguery" that did it. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Republican</ENAMEX>
push for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medical Savings</ENAMEX> Accounts threatened to undermine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> by removing
the healthiest and wealthiest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">beneficiaries</ENAMEX> from the common insurance pool. But
at the same time that he resisted this irresponsible conservative position,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> saddled himself with one of his own: support for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> without
higher payments by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">beneficiaries</ENAMEX> or structural reforms to ensure long-term
solvency. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX>, badly burned by the issue, say the ball is now in
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX>.

            
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Leadership</ENAMEX> on this issue will consist of calling the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GOP</ENAMEX>'s bluff by proposing
both short-term cuts and long-term structural reform. Unfortunately, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinton</ENAMEX>
shows little sign of doing either. He intends to make only minor adjustments in
his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February</TIMEX> budget proposal, fixes that will purport to keep the system
solvent for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 years</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> is developing a plan that is likely to
combine reduced payments to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> with a proposal to shift the
costs for home-health care out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> trust-fund account. This is an
accounting gimmick, which would keep the trust fund technically solvent for a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> without reducing costs overall. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> might still address the long-range
problem later. But as elections get closer--for congressional <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>
and for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Gore</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>--the attraction of "defending" <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> will reassert
itself.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX>, by contrast, is a long-range emergency.
This program isn't going broke now, but unless we do something about it soon,
the long-term problem will become insoluble. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Conservatives</ENAMEX>, many of whom do not
believe in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> place, are hard at work devising plans
to undermine it by shifting to a system of individual accounts. As more
moderate solutions are deferred, that kind of transformation becomes
increasingly likely. If, however, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> forces difficult changes now, we can
avoid catastrophe later. Among the most sensible options are a slight increase
in the retirement age (in keeping with growing life expectancy), a mild
means-test (in keeping with principles of fairness), and an adjustment in the
Consumer Price Index (in keeping with economic reality).

            Among these reforms,
adjusting the CPI is the most important. Because it would reduce mandated
benefits of various <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kinds</ENAMEX> in a reasonable way, it would go a long way not just
toward fixing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX>, but also toward bringing the federal budget into
structural balance. It's also a politically safe way to raise taxes, since tax
exemptions are, like many benefit programs, indexed for inflation. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinton</ENAMEX>
probably shouldn't appear to "politicize" the issue of how the CPI is
calculated by publicly supporting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pat Moynihan</ENAMEX>'s bill to cut it in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>,
to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.1 percent</NUMEX>. But he can surely finesse the result some other way. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Rob</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shapiro</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Progressive Policy Institute</ENAMEX> suggests creating an entirely new
index--a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Cost of Living</ENAMEX> Index--to replace the CPI, which would be one solution.
The problem falls to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> partly because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> is his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX>'s
greatest achievement, and partly because <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> are rightly terrified
about raising the subject on their own. If only <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX> could go to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>, only
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> can reform <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX>.

            Entitlements are not the only
thing that matters. In addition to all the things we can't foresee, the
historical verdict on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> will also hinge on such issues as whether he
manages to steer welfare reform back in the right direction; whether he avoids
being drawn into a counterproductive tax cut; and whether he overcomes his own
recent history to lead campaign-finance reform. But on all these, the basic
principle is the same. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> needs to spurn the vital <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">center</ENAMEX>, defy the
spirit of reconciliation, and recognize he has only a little time left to tell
the public what it doesn't want to hear.
