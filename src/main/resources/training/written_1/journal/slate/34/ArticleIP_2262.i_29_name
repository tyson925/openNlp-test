            By <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacob</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Weisberg</ENAMEX>

            And you think you're
busy. Consider the plight of the poor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX>. Item No. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> on his
list of things to do for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 30, 1993</TIMEX>, was to "articulate the vision of
civilizing humanity and recivilizing all <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>." That task completed, he
intended to "define, plan and begin to organize the movement for civilization
and the effort to transform the welfare state into an opportunity society to
help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> achieve productivity, responsibility and safety so they can achieve
prosperity and freedom so they can pursue happiness." Perhaps anticipating some
slight feeling of exhaustion after completing such tasks, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gingrich</ENAMEX> also
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">reminded</ENAMEX> himself (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">No. 6</ENAMEX>) about "diet, exercise, recreational renewal with
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marianne</ENAMEX>." Oh, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Newt</ENAMEX>, don't forget to pick up a gallon of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk</ENAMEX> on your way
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX>.

            This personal agenda is but
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of many treasures to be found in a huge, paperbound tome with the sexless
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">title</ENAMEX> In the Matter of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Representative</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Newt Gingrich</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Exhibits to Draft</ENAMEX>
Report of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Select Committee on Ethics</ENAMEX> . Published as an evidentiary annex
to the much shorter and duller <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Ethics Committee</ENAMEX> report itself, the volume
contains notes, memos, doodles, cancelled checks, and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Newt</ENAMEX> ephemera from
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990 to 1994</TIMEX>. Many pages are reproduced in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gingrich</ENAMEX>'s own,
open-this-parcel-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at</NUMEX>-your-own-risk, don't-mind-the-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">protruding</NUMEX>-wires scrawl. And
though it came with a bill to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$300,000</NUMEX> instead of a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$4.5 million</NUMEX>
advance, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">In the Matter</ENAMEX> is a book that, unlike <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">To Renew America</ENAMEX> ,
captures the essence of what the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> might call <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Newt Gingrich Thought</ENAMEX>. In
the spirit of recreational renewal, then, let us delve.

            There is
some tough sledding before you get to the fun part. In working out plans for
his various <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">front groups</ENAMEX> and fronts-within-fronts, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gingrich</ENAMEX> speaks in a
language consisting almost exclusively of acronyms (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COS</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PFF</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GOPAC</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALOF</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AOW</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">ACT, RAC</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CONET</ENAMEX>, among others) and abstract nouns (opportunity,
responsibility, civilization, vision, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>, analysis, dissemination,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">etc.</ENAMEX>). These nouns are often grouped in motivational quadruplets. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Gingrich</ENAMEX>
never asks anyone to listen; he admonishes them to Listen, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Learn</ENAMEX>, Help, and
Lead. He organizes his activities according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Visions</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Strategies</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Projects</ENAMEX>,
and Tactics. At another point, he suggests that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> consider the
application of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wedges</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Magnets</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shields</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Turf</ENAMEX>. Failing that, he recommends
Message, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mechanism</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Method</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Team Building</ENAMEX> to advance the goals of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Freedom</ENAMEX>,
Self-Government, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Safety</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prosperity</ENAMEX>.

            In his heart, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX> is a modules <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>. In developing
the course materials for his college course, "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Renewing American Civilization</ENAMEX>,"
he suggests the need for a "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Core Doctrine Module</ENAMEX>." He does not wish to neglect,
however, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Flying Upside-Down Module</ENAMEX> (meaning not explained), the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">We Are a</ENAMEX>
Majority <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Module</ENAMEX>, or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quality Module</ENAMEX>. Modules are not to be confused with
models, such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tory Franchise Model</ENAMEX> (a plan for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conservatives</ENAMEX> to capture
marginal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">districts</ENAMEX>). Nor are they synonymous with paradigms, as in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vision</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Implementation Paradigm</ENAMEX> described in Exhibit <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">98</NUMEX>.

            As he
flies around like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Jetson</ENAMEX> in his upside-down module, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gingrich</ENAMEX> is ever
counting. He offers <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> reasons why we must replace the welfare <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, three
steps toward success, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Four Great Truths</ENAMEX> of our <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Generation</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pillars of</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Freedom and Progress</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> aspects of committing ourselves to real change,
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> zones of invention and creativity, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> steps toward <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renewing American</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Civilization</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renewing America Strategies</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> steps to replacing the welfare
state with an opportunity society, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> key factors in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> victory. These
are easier to remember if you sing them. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fifth day</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gingrich</ENAMEX>, my
true love gave to me: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> pillars of freedom and progress, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> great truths
of our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> steps toward success, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> reasons we must replace the
welfare <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, and a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">501</NUMEX>(c)(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) .

            
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Newt</ENAMEX> often resorts to visual aids as well. In
one sketch of a private cosmology, detailed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Unabomber</ENAMEX> style of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">random</ENAMEX> capitalization, "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEWT</ENAMEX> action" is at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>, hurling arrows in every
direction. To the left lie: build up, preparAtion, and attention Focusing. On
the right: FOllOW through, diSSEMINATion, and consolidAtion then improved
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EVAluAtion</ENAMEX> and improved preparation For Future action. In another picture,
perhaps the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX>'s most fluid and evocative rendering, stick figures
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">representing Newt</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marianne</ENAMEX> recreate renewingly at the center of their solar
system. Radiating out are: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HOUSE</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GOP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>, NAtionAl <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Whip</ENAMEX>,
technology, quality, <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Olympics</ENAMEX>, the rest OF <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Georgia GOP</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6 th</ENAMEX>
District, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MiliTary Foreign</ENAMEX> policy, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Speeches</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C-SPAN</ENAMEX>, Other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GOP</ENAMEX>, recreation,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MiSSion-MOVement</ENAMEX> planning-development, health, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Teach?</ENAMEX>, write books, and
something that looks like "write eMoos."

            You would be hard pressed to
argue that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gingrich</ENAMEX> wants a positive self-image. In <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Exhibit 42</ENAMEX>, he scribbles
out what he sees as his own "primary <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mission</ENAMEX>."

            --<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Advocate</ENAMEX> of
civilization

            --definer of
civilizAtion

            --<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Teacher</ENAMEX> of the rules of
civilization

            --arouser of those who Form
civilizAtion

            --<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Organizer</ENAMEX> of the
pro-civilization activists

            --<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">possibly</NUMEX>) of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">civilizing Forces</ENAMEX>.

            Only
"possibly"? This pang of modesty soon passes. Before long, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gingrich</ENAMEX> is writing
to his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> who are helping to plan his college course: "Our goal is
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">education</ENAMEX> and not immediate profit. Together we are going to make history as
well as teach it." In another ransom-note style memo, he breaks down his list
of things to do into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> categories: <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993-2018 and 2018</TIMEX> onward. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first 25</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, he will write "a SerIEs oF booKs (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">'The history of Freedom</ENAMEX>, prosperity
and safety')." In the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> category, he will create "A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> of rules and
EXamples that is a doctrine of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Freedom</ENAMEX>, self-government, safety and
prosperity."

            Finally there is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Newt</ENAMEX>'s deep dada mode. "I keep reminding
my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> we've entered <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the decade</TIMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">teenage mutant ninja turtle</ENAMEX>," he
offers in one speech draft. Who are these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>? Why do they need constant
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reminders</ENAMEX>? Have they suggested that he see somebody? "We are in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX> of
transforming the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> from a welfare state into an opportunity
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">society</ENAMEX>--the opportunity society is based on the basic principles of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#11</NUMEX>," he
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">scribbles</ENAMEX> in another memo. Is this a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fermat</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last</TIMEX> Theorem-type joke? There is
no "<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#11</NUMEX>." In the agenda for a meeting to consider the future of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of his
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">outfits</ENAMEX>, "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Citizens Television</ENAMEX>," the following "positive" alternatives
are offered:

            a) <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Send Clear Signals</ENAMEX>

            b) Allow <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Charter</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Members</ENAMEX> to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Earmark Funds</ENAMEX>

            c) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adopt North Pole</ENAMEX> rules on
spending

            d) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Great</ENAMEX> show for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September</TIMEX>
29

            e) All out effort <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November</TIMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11-12</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Charter Meeting</ENAMEX>

            f) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renewed Emphasis on Fund</ENAMEX>
Raising

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g</ENAMEX>) Find Cinderella.

            I don't know about you <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX>,
but I say we find <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cinderella</ENAMEX>.

            He is <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$300,000</NUMEX> poorer,
perhaps, but rich in the fruits of his own imagination. Another sheet of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">grandiose</ENAMEX>, lunatic jottings ends with the demented scrawl: "This page is the
highest vAlue assigNMent/ tasK/ qua of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>." OK, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Newt</ENAMEX>, we'll pay. Just please
don't hurt us.
