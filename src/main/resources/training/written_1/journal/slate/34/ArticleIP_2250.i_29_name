            Back in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the days</TIMEX> when the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX> were the perpetual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">losers</ENAMEX> of presidential elections, they developed a
formidable ability to psyche themselves into believing that the fault lay
elsewhere. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jimmy Carter</ENAMEX> went down in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1980</TIMEX>, it was economic forces beyond
his control and rotten luck in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1984 and 1988</TIMEX>, it was a serendipitously
healthy economy that favored <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX> always complained of a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">charismatically</ENAMEX> challenged <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nominee</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX>'s magic dust, or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee Atwater</ENAMEX>'s
slime-ball tactics. As manifested by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX>' continuing refusal to give
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> control of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>, they reasoned, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> obviously liked what
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX> stood for. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> just had a funny way of expressing it. For some
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dogmatic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX>, it seemed, any explanation would do except the obvious
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>--that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> wasn't speaking for a majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> at the national
level.

            As with so much else in
politics, the traditional roles are now reversed. Today, it is the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX>
who are on a quest to rationalize political failure. A few go so far as to
argue that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GOP</ENAMEX> is winning even as it appears to be losing. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Grover Norquist</ENAMEX>,
who is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of an anti-tax <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> and an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adviser</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Newt</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gingrich</ENAMEX>, compares the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> election to the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Battle of the Bulge</ENAMEX>, in which
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> inflicted losses on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Allies</ENAMEX>, but weakened itself to a point where it
could soon be defeated. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrat</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Nazi</ENAMEX> analogy is an added bonus.

            Denial
is, according to psychoclich√©, one of the stages of dealing with death. But
what of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stations</ENAMEX> of denial? <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Conservatives</ENAMEX> are now ignoring reality with the
help of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> principal excuses.

            

               <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> It was all <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dole</ENAMEX>'s fault.
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Charles</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Krauthammer</ENAMEX> makes this case in the post-election issue of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Weekly</ENAMEX>
Standard . ("<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">No Excuses, No Alibis</ENAMEX>," declares the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX>'
self-congratulatory headline, as if pinning the entire blame on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scapegoat</ENAMEX>
deserves a medal for intellectual valor.) "The reason for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> defeat
is to be found not in the economy, not in the opponent, not in the stars, but
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX>," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krauthammer</ENAMEX> writes. "The most important fact about the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>
presidential campaign for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> is that but for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dole</ENAMEX> (and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kemp</ENAMEX>), it was
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">winnable</ENAMEX>." <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dole</ENAMEX>, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krauthammer</ENAMEX>, failed to make <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinton</ENAMEX>
administration corruption seem like a valid issue, and missed his chance to
exploit affirmative action. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tony Snow</ENAMEX>, a former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speechwriter</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Bush</ENAMEX>,
also makes this argument in his column. "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Dole</ENAMEX>, stranded in the thickets of
his ineloquence, settled on the theme of: Whatever," <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Snow</ENAMEX> complains.

            Certainly
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dole</ENAMEX> was a weak <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX>, as was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mondale</ENAMEX>, as was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dukakis</ENAMEX>, and as was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>,
both when he won in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX> and when he lost in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX> (his speechwriter, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tony</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Snow</ENAMEX>, failing to extricate him from his own verbal briar patch). But to put all
the blame on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dole</ENAMEX> presumes that there was some other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> who
might have presented a more formidable challenge to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>. Would that be <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phil</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gramm</ENAMEX>? <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Forbes</ENAMEX>? In the early phase of conservative lament over <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dole</ENAMEX>'s
hopelessness, most <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pundits</ENAMEX> were pining for ... <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Kemp</ENAMEX>. But even
the great <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">white</ENAMEX> hope <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lamar Alexander</ENAMEX> would have faced the same situation <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dole</ENAMEX>
had to deal with: a damaging but untouchable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GOP</ENAMEX> abortion plank and guilt by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gingrich Congress</ENAMEX>.

            

               <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> It was due to circumstances beyond our
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX>.
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX>
suddenly sound like a bunch of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Marxist</ENAMEX> economic determinists. "<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX>'s
presidential election was won back in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January</TIMEX>, when the economy, which seemed
headed for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> or even negative growth, suddenly turned around," writes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">James</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">K. Glassman</ENAMEX>, the conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">columnist</ENAMEX>. "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Economy</ENAMEX> is
destiny." Others make an even broader structural argument. "It was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s
good fortune to run for re-election in a generally satisfied <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>," write
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ramesh Ponnuru, Rich Lowry</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kate O'Beirne</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Review</ENAMEX> . In
the words of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fred Barnes</ENAMEX>, offering an alternative explanation to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Krauthammer</ENAMEX>'s
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Standard</ENAMEX> : "In a period of peace and prosperity--such as now--an
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">incumbent president</ENAMEX> is all but certain to be reelected. It's that simple."

            That
simple? Peace and prosperity? <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">As recently as four years ago</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pundits</ENAMEX> were
explaining <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Bush</ENAMEX>'s defeat after winning the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gulf</ENAMEX> (and arguably the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Cold</ENAMEX>)
War--delivering not just "peace" but victory--by likening it to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Churchill</ENAMEX>'s
defeat by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peace</ENAMEX> gave <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> the security to
try someone new. As for "prosperity," <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> certainly didn't attribute
their victories of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1984 and 1988</TIMEX> to a fortuitously good economy. In those
ancient <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>, they thought the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> deserved some credit for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of
the economy. They also insisted that larger ideological tides were at work.

            

               <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> If you squint, it looks like we
won.
            

            In one of
several exculpatory post-election editorials, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX>
notes that votes were much more evenly split among married <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> than among
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">divorced</ENAMEX>, widowed, or unmarried ones. "Seen in this context, what was seen as
an issue of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">male</ENAMEX> vs. female actually emerges as the nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> vs.
something else," the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> write. The editorial goes on to
note that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between one-third</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one-half</NUMEX> of all divorced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> spend some time
on welfare: "As for the famous gender gap, it appears to be merely part of the
basic political tensions that now exist between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defenders</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>'s
post-War system of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> guarantees and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> who argue for an
updating of the ways we ensure personal and financial security."

            The theory
gets a bit murky here. If the "basic political tensions" in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> are
between pro-big-government and anti-big-government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">factions</ENAMEX>, and the
pro-big-government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">faction</ENAMEX> just won, how are the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal</ENAMEX> 's editorial
sympathizers supposed to find comfort in that analysis? If <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> are
disproportionately pro big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>, for whatever reason, how does that
disqualify the big-government philosophy, or explain away its apparent triumph?
Are the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> trying to say that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dole</ENAMEX> would have won the
election if not for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who are--or might go--on welfare? Or, perhaps, that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dole</ENAMEX> is actually the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of married <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>? In any case, the response
is: so what? It's true: If you don't count the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who voted for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>,
most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> voted for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dole</ENAMEX>. Back on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Planet Earth</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> won, by a bigger
margin than he did last time around, and with the help of a gender gap that
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> have no idea how to close.

            

               <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> We actually did win.
            

            In an
interview with the electronic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intellectual Capital</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Grover</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Norquist</ENAMEX> said, "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> ran as a false conservative but he ran as a
conservative, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> ran as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conservative</ENAMEX>, and they both won." This
matches the argument of that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publication</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sponsor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pete du Pont</ENAMEX>, who adds in
his column: "As the election smoke clears we can now see the political
landscape clearly. What stretches out behind us is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty years</TIMEX> of an
increasingly conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>." In the opinion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Standard</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> retention of congressional control "is a tribute to
the inexorable tidal pattern of partisan realignment."

            The
premise here is that the only authentic <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrat</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">McGovern Democrat</ENAMEX>. If the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX> win while claiming to stand for anything to the right of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1972</TIMEX>
platform, it counts as a victory for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX>. This is silly. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> ran on
a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platform</ENAMEX> that, while certainly less liberal than those of his recent
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">predecessors</ENAMEX>, is best characterized as reform <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">liberal</ENAMEX>, not conservative. His
politics owe far more to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roosevelt</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Truman</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kennedy</ENAMEX> than they do to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goldwater or Reagan</ENAMEX>. If his move toward the center means that the inexorable
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> tide continues to rise, then, by the same token, it counts as a
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democratic</ENAMEX> victory that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> retained control of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> only by
disavowing their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX> vintage <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">radicalism</ENAMEX>. If <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> has been <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gingriched</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gingrich</ENAMEX> has been <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Foleyated</ENAMEX>.

            And even by their own theory, how do these <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX>
explain the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX>' preference for an ersatz <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> over the genuine
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">article</ENAMEX>? Wherever you place <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Clinton</ENAMEX> on the ideological spectrum, his
defeat of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Dole</ENAMEX> cannot rationally be interpreted as a victory for
conservatism.

            Of course, the above reasons
all contributed to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s victory. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dole</ENAMEX> was a lousy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> a
brilliant one. Peace and prosperity, which were only partly the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>'s
doing, handed him an enormous advantage. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> shifted to the center for
tactical as well as philosophical reasons. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dole</ENAMEX> also lost because of deep
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> problems. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Voters</ENAMEX> rejected, and will probably continue to reject,
giving total power to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> that remains a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hostage</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">right</ENAMEX> on
abortion and that threatens to scale back <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> in a radical way.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Conservatives</ENAMEX> can start
facing up to these problems. Or, they can keep blaming it all on bum luck, and
keep on losing.
