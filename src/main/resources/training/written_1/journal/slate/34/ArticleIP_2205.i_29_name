<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tosses Its Cookies</ENAMEX>
            

            One can lead a happy and
fulfilling life, and even use the Internet contentedly, without understanding
"<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cookies</ENAMEX>." So if you don't know what "<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cookies</ENAMEX>" are--in the computer sense--go
in peace and consider yourself fortunate. But if you have ventured into the
wonderful world of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cookies</ENAMEX>, you may be one of those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX> who is alarmed about
them. This is completely unnecessary. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Cookies</ENAMEX> are merely special messages a Web
site's computer sends to your computer when you drop by to visit--for example,
"Have a nice day," or, "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">End</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> abuse now," or, "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Wipe</ENAMEX> out this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>'s hard
drive on his next birthday," or, "Psst ... hey, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buddy</ENAMEX>. Yeah, you with the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pathetic 486</ENAMEX> chip and the broken CD-ROM. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">G</ENAMEX> says there's an extra <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">8 megs</NUMEX> of
memory for you if you crash when she tries to install <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Netscape</ENAMEX>." All perfectly
innocent.

            Nevertheless, a few cookie
paranoiacs have set their browsers to alert them when a cookie is heading their
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX>. And some of them have complained that this notice pops up a lot when
they're reading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate</ENAMEX> actually uses very few <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cookies</ENAMEX>. For example, we
tell your browser to remember the date of your visit. When you come back the
next time, your computer sends that date back to ours. If it's still the same
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">day</ENAMEX>, we don't feed you the cover again but take you straight to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX> of
Contents. Similarly, we use <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cookies</ENAMEX> to remember whether you prefer your
contents listed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">page number</ENAMEX> or by date of posting, and to remember which
entry in a "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dispatch" or "Dialogue</ENAMEX>" you last read. All perfectly innocent.

            But we
did investigate these complaints, and it turned out that our server computers
were sending jars and jars of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cookies</ENAMEX> we didn't need. To emphasize: This was
information from us going into your computer, not information
from you going into ours. And it really was harmless stuff. Nevertheless, we
have turned off these superfluous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cookies</ENAMEX>. If you don't believe us, or if that
doesn't satisfy you, your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">browser</ENAMEX> can screen or block all <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cookies</ENAMEX>. On <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>
Internet <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Explorer</ENAMEX>, just click on "<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">View</ENAMEX>," then "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Options</ENAMEX>," and choose the
"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Advanced</ENAMEX>" tab. Of course, is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> really alerting you to all incoming
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cookies</ENAMEX>--or only to other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cookies</ENAMEX>? We merely ask.

            

               Fore!
            

            That sense of excitement in
the air ... the soaring stock market ... <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX> weather that has lasted
beyond its normal term ... the sudden improvement in scansion and rhyme in
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> poetry: These welcome developments can have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> possible
explanations. One is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Ni√±o</ENAMEX>, the fashionable weather trend that, as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">David</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Plotz</ENAMEX> explains in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</TIMEX>'s "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Assessment</ENAMEX>,"
explains everything. The other explanation is the imminent arrival of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IE4</TIMEX>, the
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> generation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>'s Internet <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Explorer</ENAMEX> Web-browser software. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate</ENAMEX>,
of course, is determined to bring the same degree of objectivity and hype
resistance to this event that we legendarily brought to our coverage of the
birth of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 2,000</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX>--an occasion the release of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IE4</TIMEX>, as it
happens, closely resembles.

            Click
here to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">download</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IE4</ENAMEX>. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">And</ENAMEX>, what the heck, click here to download <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Netscape</ENAMEX>'s fourth-generation <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">browser</ENAMEX>.) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate</ENAMEX> is
already adding features to take advantage of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IE4</TIMEX>'s enormous power, beauty, and
sophistication. For example, if you have IE4 installed, when you click on an
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>'s name a short bio pops up (instead of the click taking you to the bio
at the bottom of the page). Not just that, but ... well, yes, just that for the
moment. But there's lots more coming. Just so you're prepared.
