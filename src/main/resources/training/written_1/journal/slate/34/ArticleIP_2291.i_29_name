            The urge to explain an
entire election in terms of a single lesson or message is usually worth
resisting. But in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</TIMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">off-year</TIMEX> voting, the chief theme seems too strong
and too weird to resist. The new driving force in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> politics is
driving.

            The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> biggest races were
the gubernatorial contests in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Jersey</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX>, and both were dominated
by car talk. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Jersey</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democratic</ENAMEX> challenger <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James McGreevey</ENAMEX> put a pledge
to make driving cheaper at the center of his campaign. Taking a page from his
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">opponent Christine Todd Whitman</ENAMEX>'s playbook of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four years ago</TIMEX>, McGreevey
promised an across-the-board reduction of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 percent</NUMEX>, not in income taxes but
in auto-insurance premiums. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Jersey</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> spend more time behind
the wheel than in any other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> and consequently pay the most for auto
insurance (though few recognize any connection), this was an offer almost too
good to refuse. It very nearly turned a previously popular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">incumbent</ENAMEX> out of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> in the midst of an economic boom. In exit polls, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX>
said the insurance issue was an important factor in their vote.

            In a
capitalist economic system, you might wonder at the idea of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX> simply
ordering a statewide price reduction. But in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Jersey</ENAMEX>, nearly everyone takes
it for granted that you can't have a free market in anything as important as
automobile insurance. Only the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Libertarian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murray Sabrin</ENAMEX>, favored
deregulating the system under which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">insurers</ENAMEX> must petition a state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> to
raise rates and are forbidden to earn profits of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 6 percent</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whitman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McGreevey</ENAMEX> battled over what kind of additional regulation
would most effectively force a reduction in rates. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whitman</ENAMEX> offered the more
sensible proposal, a sort of managed-competition scheme modeled on national
legislation sponsored by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel Patrick Moynihan</ENAMEX>. Her plan would require
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">insurers</ENAMEX> to offer as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> option a true no-fault policy, which says that you
can't try to recover damages for pain and suffering. She saved her job by
claiming that this would mean an even bigger break for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">motorists</ENAMEX>--of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to 25</NUMEX>
percent.

            In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX>, it was the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> who hot-wired the
cheaper driving issue and drove it to victory. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> derives much of its
revenue from an anachronistic personal-property tax, which has evolved into a
tax mainly on automobile ownership. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Gilmore</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX>,
promised to abolish this tax and coasted to victory by a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13-point</NUMEX> margin.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gilmore</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democratic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponent</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Don Beyer</ENAMEX>, might have been expected to
capitalize on this issue himself. In addition to being the former lieutenant
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX>, he is a car <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealer</ENAMEX> in northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX>, famous for his mysterious
advertising slogan, "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Don Beyer Volvo--The Great Experiment</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Route 7</ENAMEX>." (What
does it mean? <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Click</ENAMEX> .)

            Back
during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX>, according to news reports, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beyer</ENAMEX>'s political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultants</ENAMEX>
recommended that he call for the abolition of the car tax before <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gilmore</ENAMEX> did.
Unfortunately for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beyer</ENAMEX>, a bad case of liberal compunction set in. He said that
dropping the tax would bankrupt the state and harm education. After <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gilmore</ENAMEX>
started hammering him with the issue, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beyer</ENAMEX> countered with a complicated
proposal of his own that would have given a tax rebate to lower-income drivers
only. While slightly more realistic, this lacked the simplistic appeal of
abolition.

            In the only congressional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">race</ENAMEX> of this election, the
contest for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Susan Molinari</ENAMEX>'s seat on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Staten Island</ENAMEX> was fought in part over the
cost of driving across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Verrazano-Narrows Bridge</ENAMEX>, which connects Staten
Island to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brooklyn</ENAMEX> and thence to the rest of the world. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrat</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eric</ENAMEX>
Vitaliano, who has been a state-assembly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many years</TIMEX>, took credit for
reducing the cost for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Staten Island</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX>, who get discounts of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to 70</NUMEX>
percent on the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$7</NUMEX> round-trip toll (and who can ride to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manhattan</ENAMEX> at no charge
on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Staten Island Ferry</ENAMEX>). This was good, but it wasn't good enough.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vitaliano</ENAMEX> lost to a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">City Council</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vito Fossella</ENAMEX>, who said
that he would work to eliminate the toll on the bridge completely.

            In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Denver</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> rejected a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$16-billion</NUMEX> expansion of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>'s light-rail system. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Supporters</ENAMEX> of the plan argued that better public
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transportation</ENAMEX> would reduce traffic and lighten <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Denver</ENAMEX>'s notorious "brown
cloud." <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Opponents</ENAMEX> objected to a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">four-tenths-</NUMEX>of<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">-1-cent</NUMEX> increase in the sales tax
to pay for the system, and argued that public transportation is a violation of
nature in the West, where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> like to drive.

            In
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seattle</ENAMEX>, the danger of getting caught in bridge traffic at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">rush hour</TIMEX> is a
citywide obsession (and a subject with which 
                  Slate
               's headquarters
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">team</ENAMEX> frequently bores those of us in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">provinces</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mayor</ENAMEX>'s race this year
was fought in part over alternative approaches to preventing further
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX> and congestion. Even in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York City</ENAMEX>, a place where sane <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> do
not drive, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">incumbent Mayor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rudy Giuliani</ENAMEX> scored <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some</NUMEX> points by taking on every
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> in the world over the issue of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diplomats</ENAMEX> who double-<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> near the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Nations</ENAMEX>.

            
It's easy to disparage auto politics as the
parochialism of a post-ideological era. With the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Cold War</ENAMEX> won, the budget
balanced, crime in free fall, and the economy booming, politics is so free of
important content that elections can hinge on who will be nicer to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX>. It is
a bit stupid to spend time debating who is more likely to accede to a toll
increase--as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> did in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Jersey</ENAMEX>. But some of the driving issues
are not trivial. According to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> recent federal study, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70 percent</NUMEX> of urban
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">freeways</ENAMEX> are now clogged at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">rush hour</TIMEX>. What makes this more than a problem of
traffic engineering is that you can't reduce congestion without raising issues
like air pollution, the greenhouse effect, and the harm that metropolitan
sprawl can do to a region's quality of life.

            What is dismal about this
politics is that the new pandering about driving is as bad as the old pandering
<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about</NUMEX> tax cuts. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> difference is that this time around, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX> are less
likely to get played for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">suckers</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Jersey</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Staten Island</ENAMEX>, candidates
from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> debated the relative merits of alternative
free-lunch options. Reducing insurance rates by discouraging frivolous lawsuits
is a perfectly sound idea. But so too would it be a good idea to discourage
driving through higher tolls, pricier <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX>, and better public transportation. A
program like this would mitigate environmental and congestion problems as well
as quality-of-life <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concerns</ENAMEX>.

            Politically, however, such a
platform probably won't get you very far. The last <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politician</ENAMEX> to propose making
driving more expensive was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Gore</ENAMEX>, who fought to include a small energy
tax--which would have included <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gasoline</ENAMEX>--in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>
economic plan. It almost sank the whole deal. Since then, there's been no
mention of tollbooths on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX> to the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21 st century</TIMEX>.
