            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last week</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Culturebox</ENAMEX> had an important insight into the nature of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">spirituality</ENAMEX>. She would like to share it with you <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>. The revelation
occurred while she was reading a remarkable column by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sally Quinn</ENAMEX> in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> about labyrinths.
Labyrinths, for those
who don't follow trends in New Age healing, are the hot new form of meditation.
You march around in them, you get lost, and you find yourself on a higher
plane. They are often built by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX> as a way to lure <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> back into the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fold</ENAMEX>, and by <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">spas</ENAMEX> as a higher form of relaxation, sort of like water aerobics.
Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> spent their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">New Year</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eve</ENAMEX> walking in labyrinths, rather than
pursuing more conventional paths to transcendence, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">champagne</ENAMEX> and foie
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gras</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quinn</ENAMEX> walked her first labyrinth when she was a guest at the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Golden Door</ENAMEX>, a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">spa</ENAMEX> for society <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ladies</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southern California</ENAMEX>. She was dubious at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, but
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> insisted, and it was a truly transforming experience. She
concentrated on some tests her learning-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">disabled son</ENAMEX> was taking at that very
moment back in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>. Later, she discovered that though he'd done poorly
on most portions of the test, he had scored off the charts on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>: "The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">maze</ENAMEX>."
This was her <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step toward conversion, but what really moved her was a
photograph taken of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> who had just walked a maze for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time.
We'll let <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marylin Arrigan</ENAMEX> tell this story in her own words, or at least <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quinn</ENAMEX>'s
words:

            
               "Suddenly," [<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Arrigan</ENAMEX>] says, "I was in a very bright light. I had a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vision</ENAMEX> of an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> face with long straight hair, blowing in the wind. He had
uplifted <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX>. He kept telling me to look up. I kept looking up. I was engulfed
in light.
            

            
               "He asked if I was committed to walking the labyrinth. I said 'yes.'
He said, 'If you are, you must leave a footprint.' When I got to the center I
left two deep footprints. As I was walking out he said, 'Now you are walking
out, you must go out in the world and leave a footprint.'

               "
            

            
               ... <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arrigan</ENAMEX> can't explain her vision. "I was in tears on and off. It
was like a roller coaster. But toward the end I was very calm, it was like a
peace. Like I had a mission."
            

            Skeptical? <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quinn</ENAMEX> has the clincher:

            
               A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">volunteer</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carol Davis</ENAMEX>, took
pictures with a digital camera as they were finishing up. Flipping through the
images, she stopped, stunned, at a shot of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. For there, in the center
of the picture, was what looked like a brilliant shaft of multicolored light,
coming from above and directed exactly at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arrigan</ENAMEX>.
            

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> photo <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX>, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quinn</ENAMEX>,
thinks that the "brilliant shaft of multicolored light" is lens flare. But
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quinn</ENAMEX> disagrees. The experience gave <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arrigan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quinn</ENAMEX> a sense of higher
purpose, and what else do you need to know? 

            Very little. Once upon a time, religion
in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> was a terrifying, finger-pointing, hellfire-and-brimstone affair.
God didn't come to you; you went to God, or else. Insofar as there was life
outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>, it was secondary. Religious doctrine was dense and
difficult and if you misunderstood it, you could be excommunicated or jailed.
Now, though, everything is different. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Religion</ENAMEX> isn't mean and threatening. It
doesn't demand all your time. You can fit it into your busy schedule. If you
need a "mission," as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arrigan</ENAMEX> says, you just do whatever you're already doing,
as long as you can coax from it some movement of the soul. A socialite and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalist</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sally Quinn</ENAMEX> can have her spiritual moments along with her
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aromatherapy</ENAMEX> and massage, and find proof of God in newspaper photos. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Interior</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> for home decor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazines</ENAMEX> can take up <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">feng shui</ENAMEX>, the
ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> art of object placement. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Woody Harrelson</ENAMEX> can adopt tantric sex.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Gym</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trainers</ENAMEX> can practice yoga. <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">Football</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coaches</ENAMEX> can preach the religion of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sports</ENAMEX>. Culturebox, whose job it is to write articles that are short, is
planning to devote herself to kabala, a form of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mysticism</ENAMEX>, weirdly made
popular by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madonna</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Roseanne</ENAMEX>, in which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> finds a deeper meaning in small,
seemingly insignificant words and individual letters.
