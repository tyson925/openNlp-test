            Both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los Angeles Times</ENAMEX> lead with the mounting death toll--up to
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20,000</NUMEX>, both papers declare--in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venezuela</ENAMEX> mudslides, now recognized to be
that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s worst natural disaster ever. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> puts <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venezuela</ENAMEX> inside
(although it fronts a picture of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> maintaining order there in the
aftermath) and goes instead with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> state court ruling that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giuliani</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>'s aggressive strategy for restricting the number of
X-rated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bookstores</ENAMEX> and movie <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">theaters</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Apple</ENAMEX> was based on an overly
broad definition of an adult-oriented <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> leads with the likely unveiling <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> of tough new environmental rules (to take effect in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX>)
requiring all oil <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> to produce cleaner <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gasoline</ENAMEX> (via lowering sulfur
content) while also requiring that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SUVs</ENAMEX> meet the same pollution standards as
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> (starting in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2009</TIMEX>). The story, which nobody else fronts, quotes supporters
of the new rules as saying their impact on air quality will be the same as
taking <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">54 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> off the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>.

            The papers report that hardest hit in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venezuela</ENAMEX> is the coastal <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vargas</ENAMEX>, which has been transformed, says the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> , into "a landscape of
destruction filled with the stench of death." <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> working on the
international aid response is quoted by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> saying, "You have areas where
the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mud</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> story deep and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> will never be recovered. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">areas</ENAMEX> may just be declared cemeteries." <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">USAT</ENAMEX> quotes <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venezuela</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hugo Chavez</ENAMEX> as saying, "There are bodies in the sea, there are bodies
under mud, there are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> everywhere," while the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> attributes this
same quote to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreign minister</ENAMEX>.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> lead explains that at issue is not the strict
zoning confinement of adult businesses championed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giuliani</ENAMEX>
administration--that has been upheld in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX>--but rather its attempt to say
that a business was adult-oriented if <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40 percent</NUMEX> or more of its floor space or
stock was <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only</NUMEX>. This reg was a clever attempt to define a vague, moral
concept--pornography--by a specific, non-moral one--square footage. But as the
paper explains, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> were clever back, often lining their shelves
with videos of cartoons, wrestling, and karate movies that were hardly ever
sold. Although the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> called such practices, "sham compliance," the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> has
ruled, says the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> , that they comply with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>'s guidelines,
which say nothing about the profitability or turnover of stock.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> off-lead, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> goes above the
fold with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX>'s decision by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vermont Supreme Court</ENAMEX> that gay and lesbian <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couples</ENAMEX> are entitled to
the same legal benefits and protections enjoyed by heterosexual married
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couples</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAT</ENAMEX> stuffs the ruling. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> calls this the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> real
breakthrough for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocates</ENAMEX> of gay marriage. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> left it up to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">legislature</ENAMEX> to decide whether this equal entitlement can best be achieved via
legalizing gay marriage or, alternatively, by codifying the rights and benefits
of domestic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partners</ENAMEX>. The papers rough out how this decision could be not the
end but merely the beginning of a legal morass: If the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">legislature</ENAMEX> does proceed
to recognize gay marriage, then <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couples</ENAMEX> might come to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vermont</ENAMEX> to get married
and then return to their home <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> citing the privileges of marriage
there.

            A front-page <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAT</ENAMEX> story reports that for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time in the past
few <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> (it would have been nice if the story specified exactly how many),
the average diversified mutual fund is beating the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S&P</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> stock index. The
edge isn't huge--<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only about 2.7 percent</NUMEX>. But, the story explains, the margin
would have been better still if it weren't for the average <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.4 percent</NUMEX> of
return the average mutual fund charges.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> reports that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George W. Bush</ENAMEX> is
launching an advertising push on the Internet that could demonstrate the
feasibility of the medium for political pitching. It goes like this: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GWB</ENAMEX> banner
ads pop up when a Web <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">surfer</ENAMEX> arrives at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of a number of sites chosen for
their likelihood to be visited by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> or independent <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Hampshire</ENAMEX> or
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iowa</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX>. The banners ask, "How much will the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">BUSH</ENAMEX> TAX CUT save <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">YOU?</ENAMEX>" and
then provide an interactive tax calculator to let the surfer answer the
question.

            All the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX> check in with their assessment of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Shaw</ENAMEX>
assessment in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Staple Center</ENAMEX> mess. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Today</ENAMEX>'s
Papers can barely wait for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brill</ENAMEX>'s Content analysis of these
analyses of that analysis.) Thanks to all these term papers, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TP</ENAMEX> has finally
found an instance of towering journalistic integrity in the whole episode: At
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> point an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> ad <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exec</ENAMEX> objected to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX>'s special issue's use
of the locution "the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Staples Center</ENAMEX>," because the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> do not use
the definite article. But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Parks</ENAMEX> refused to drop it.
