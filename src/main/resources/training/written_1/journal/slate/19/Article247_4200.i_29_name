            As I'm sure someone has reminded you, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sarah</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samantha Morton</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Sweet</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lowdown</ENAMEX> isn't a "deaf-mute" but a mere mute: How else could she worship the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">protagonist</ENAMEX>'s artistry? Better than a mute, I might add: She is a mute who does
laundry. It's the talent for laundry that puts her closest to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Woody Allen</ENAMEX>'s
heart, I bet.

            Yes, we can all agree, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger</ENAMEX> demonstrates unparalleled "consideration for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX>" and "habitual fairness." <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger</ENAMEX>, you have evolved into the conscience
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cinema</ENAMEX>. But I ask you: Isn't that role sometimes paralyzing?
You treat The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Green Mile</ENAMEX> as if it's a humanist milestone on the order of
To Kill a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mockingbird</ENAMEX> . But it has been <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than a third</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a century</TIMEX>
since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mockingbird</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Great White Father</ENAMEX> and that shambling, saintly black
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">martyr</ENAMEX> who pays for the sex crimes of white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>--and in-between came the
civil-rights movement. Isn't it time to retire this archetype? Isn't it so
violently at odds with reality that it threatens to do more harm than good?
(How disillusioning that some <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African-Americans</ENAMEX> have rough edges.) And while
I'm at it: Why'd you like that damn <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Jar Jar picture</ENAMEX>???

            I'm sympathetic to your complaints about <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> who loudly swap opinions at
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">screenings</ENAMEX>, but I think it's more an issue for you (and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elvis</ENAMEX>, now) than for
me. I could broadcast my views over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PA</ENAMEX> system and no one would much care,
whereas word of your likes or dislikes would promptly make its way through the
ranks to studio <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">presidents</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">CEOs</ENAMEX>, and world <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX>. (I refrain from saying
what I think after most movies not because I want to tantalize <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> but
because I reserve the right to change my mind in the course of writing a
review.) Anyway, I'm always happy to eavesdrop on what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are saying in
screening <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">theaters</ENAMEX>--I often use that stuff in my columns, the tackier
the better.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sarah</ENAMEX>: I hate to say it, but the "guyness" in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX>'s movies might be
the corollary to all those young, hot-dogging male <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX> whom we've been
celebrating. But there have still been a ton of great female
performances. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Sayles</ENAMEX>, the last proud liberal-feminist, wrote a beautiful
part for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Limbo</ENAMEX> that she turned into one
of the comebacks of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the decade</TIMEX>. Like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Janet McTeer</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tumbleweeds</ENAMEX> , she
plays a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> who's a, well, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tumbleweed</ENAMEX> who gravitates to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> she shouldn't
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gravitate</ENAMEX> to and takes her long-suffering <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> along for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fall</TIMEX>. I
suppose you'd say these are soft roles, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX>' roles, but both actresses give
these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> complex consciousnesses--they fall and watch themselves falling,
and they subtly comment on their trajectories.

            A very, very strange performance is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sigourney Weaver</ENAMEX>'s in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A Map of the</ENAMEX>
World . As in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Good Mother</ENAMEX> , the issue is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>'s
self-destructive impulses in a society that has fixed expectations of how
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> and caregivers should behave. She can't forgive herself for a tragic
accident on her property, and in ways that I'm still trying to sort out, she
helps to bring about her own--and her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>'s--near ruin. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weaver</ENAMEX> plays this
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> from the outset as unhinged, and the first-time <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scott Elliot</ENAMEX>,
doesn't modulate her craziness enough. But by the end, the performance makes
sense: It's as if she's scything her way <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> through a thicket of her own
unmanageable emotions--and she gets there.

            As for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hanks</ENAMEX>, let me say that I think he's still a wonderful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actor</ENAMEX> but am
sorry that such a heavy spirit has descended upon him. He was once the
breeziest of goofballs--but with a greater emotional range than almost any
other goofball. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A few weeks</TIMEX> back I was reminiscing about the old <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hanks</ENAMEX> with
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pauline Kael</ENAMEX>. (Yes, I admit it--I've talked to her. I'm a fellow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traveler</ENAMEX>.) We
both confessed a fondness for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Turner</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hooch</ENAMEX> . Then I said, "It's too
bad they had to kill <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hooch</ENAMEX>, though. I mean, what big-funny-dog movie ends with
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> getting blown away?"

            "Be thankful," said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pauline</ENAMEX>. "If <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hanks</ENAMEX> made it <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> there would be a
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">memorial</ENAMEX> service."

            See you <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX>.
