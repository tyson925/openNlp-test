            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harry</ENAMEX>,

            I hear you on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Putin</ENAMEX>. I guess <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandy Berger</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clintonites</ENAMEX> are clinging
to the fact that the new <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prez</ENAMEX> worked with the liberal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mayor</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Petersburg</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late '80s</TIMEX>, but that doesn't seem so comforting. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hey</ENAMEX>, at the
end of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> it's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Uganda</ENAMEX> with nukes. Can you imagine who we'd turn to if our
country was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one-tenth</NUMEX> as screwed up as theirs? I was boning up for our <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeltsin</ENAMEX>
coverage over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the weekend</TIMEX> and read that their GDP has shrunk <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">43 percent</NUMEX> since
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX>. We have a recession for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few months</TIMEX> in which the GDP barely dips, and we
seriously consider handing the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> over to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ross Perot</ENAMEX>.

            Yeah, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeltsin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">farewell</ENAMEX> was truly bizarre. Besides his halting tone, that
shot of him at an unusually wide table with a feeble <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> behind him
added to the whole Madame Tussaud effect.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hey</ENAMEX>, don't get me wrong on "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Peanuts</ENAMEX>." I'm basically a Simpsons kind
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Irony über</ENAMEX> alles ! But "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Peanuts</ENAMEX>" did have a sophisticated side
beyond the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Met Life</ENAMEX> crap. After all, the cartoon was inhabited by self-doubters
(<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charlie Brown</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Linus</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peppermint Pattie</ENAMEX>) and narcissists (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lucy</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Snoopy</ENAMEX>), which
made it a lot more nuanced than, say "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Blondie</ENAMEX>" or "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beetle Bailey</ENAMEX>." All
discussions of comedy are invariably <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lame</ENAMEX>, so I'll stop here, but suffice it to
say, I'm still (sniff, sniff) hurting a bit. On <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Capra</ENAMEX>, vive la
différence but I'm a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fan</ENAMEX>--again, not because of its cheerfulness but
because of its dark side.

            On another topic: <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Does Hollywood love McCain</ENAMEX>? <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> is still romancing
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> in a way that makes previous presidential infatuations (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tsongas</ENAMEX>,
Babbitt, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anderson</ENAMEX>) look like spin the bottle. I thought I saw something about
how <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Geffen</ENAMEX> liked him even though he's backing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX>. Can <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Hanks</ENAMEX> be far
behind? I've dealt with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">some</TIMEX> and I'm not impervious to the charm either.
Part of it, I think, beyond his much-remarked-upon candor or campaign-finance
support is the fact that he's so at peace about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vietnam</ENAMEX>--unlike the rest of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. He jokes about it; he supported recognition of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hanoi</ENAMEX>; he doesn't piss
on those who didn't serve. He's walking, talking absolution for the rest of us.
That's not a bad calling card.

            Best,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matt</ENAMEX>
