            The papers offer a mixed bag of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> stories, with no direct overlap among
the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> front pages. The New
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">York Times</ENAMEX> lead summarizes a report documenting mistakes in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Veterans</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 1997-December 1998</TIMEX>, and tracks the ensuing drive to conduct
similar studies in other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> health-care systems. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> details
the start of an investigation into a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Dec. 6</TIMEX> air traffic control glitch that
nearly caused <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> passenger <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planes</ENAMEX> to collide. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los Angeles Times</ENAMEX> runs a
local story about the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>'s failure to crack down on fraud in its Medi-Cal
system. In an unprecedented front-page address to its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX>, the LAT
takes responsibility for violating the hallowed "separation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> and
state"--the code that prevents <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalists</ENAMEX> from maintaining a financial or
personal interest in the stories they cover.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Veterans Affairs</ENAMEX> report enumerates <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 3,000</NUMEX>
mistakes made in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">V.A.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 1997-December 1998</TIMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Seven hundred</NUMEX> of
these cases resulted in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s death. The study, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of its kind
by a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> health-care system, found that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> committed a range of errors,
including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> on the wrong body part or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> reports.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Spokesmen</ENAMEX> for the health-care industry concur that the frequency of errors is
probably no lower in other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital systems</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Academy of Sciences</ENAMEX>,
which recently called for similar studies in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> nationwide, reported
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last month</TIMEX> that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between 44,000 and 98,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> die from mistakes:
That's higher than the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who die <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annually</TIMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">highways</ENAMEX> or from
<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX>.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> report that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> security <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> are
watching with increasing vigilance potential <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">New Year</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eve</ENAMEX> hot spots. The
former fronts news that all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">301</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ports</ENAMEX> of entry into the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> have been
placed on high alert after an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Algerian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> was arrested <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> for smuggling
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bomb materials</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>. Although the headline, "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">US Borders on High Alert</ENAMEX>,"
suggests the story might be about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Customs Service</ENAMEX> preparations against future
smuggling attempts, the story explores the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">suspect</ENAMEX>'s alleged ties to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Osama</ENAMEX> bin
Laden. The equipment confiscated by customs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> seems to match that used
by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">others</ENAMEX> linked to bin Laden. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tim Weiner</ENAMEX> writes in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> have helped pin down at home and abroad <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> suspected of
plotting violence over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">New Year</TIMEX>'s. An aside halfway through the piece likens
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>, scanning the Internet for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hacker</ENAMEX> assaults and political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">extremists</ENAMEX>,
to "ancients searching the skies for a sign."

            A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> front-pager and a quirky <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> Magazine spread examine just
how low Web "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">retailers</ENAMEX>" will go in the name of establishing a loyal customer
base. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> story anoints <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Familywonder</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX> discount-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX>: The site,
an online <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">warehouse</ENAMEX> of things to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, promised <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX> to send <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$20</NUMEX>
to anyone who answered a survey and purchased <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">at least $20</NUMEX> worth of
merchandise. With the help of a toy industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guru</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> calculates
that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Etoys</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX> would lose <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$41.97</NUMEX> on a sale totaling <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$68.97</NUMEX>. These <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> are
jockeying to build "brand names in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the new millennium</TIMEX>" (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX>), by hotly
pursuing tactics that "would be, in any normal business, ruinous"
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX>).
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russians</ENAMEX> go to the polls <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> to elect a new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Duma</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> describes
the campaign as "a barroom brawl, a chairs-over-the-head affair" that the
disgruntled public nonetheless took seriously. An <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adviser</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moscow</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mayor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yuri</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Luzhkov</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kremlin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foe</ENAMEX>) told the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kremlin</ENAMEX>'s campaign for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Duma</ENAMEX>
seats "makes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Nixon</ENAMEX>'s presidential election bids look clean." The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
Times es see the election as an "unofficial Presidential primary"
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX>); <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russians</ENAMEX> will elect a new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next summer</TIMEX>. By contrast, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Hoffman</ENAMEX> presents a closer look at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Duma</ENAMEX>'s structure and
how a change in the party composition (i.e., fewer <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Communists</ENAMEX>) might result in
action on market reform and tax law.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> may force the usually independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Export-Import</ENAMEX>
Bank to drop <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$500 million</NUMEX> in loan guarantees to a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> oil <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> known for
questionable practices, according to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> front-pager. At issue: The
administration is debating whether it is worse to give loans to an operation
generally thought to be shady, or risk jeopardize already strained relations
with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kremlin</ENAMEX>. Isn't this thinking similar to the logic faulted in a number
of "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Who Lost Russia?</ENAMEX>" articles that have appeared in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent months</TIMEX>?: Fear of
something worse around the corner persuades the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> to live with
known evils. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Candidates Bush</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX> have all suggested that the
administration stop the loans, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> reports.

            Under the headline "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">To Our Readers</ENAMEX>," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kathryn M. Downing</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Parks</ENAMEX>,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">publisher</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX>, explain that the paper shared with
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Staples</ENAMEX> profits generated from an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Oct. 10</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sunday Times Magazine</ENAMEX> devoted
to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LA</ENAMEX>'s new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Staples Center</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-column text comes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about a month</TIMEX> and a half
after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Downing</ENAMEX> asked forgiveness from an irate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tomorrow</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> will
print the results of media <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Shaw</ENAMEX>'s investigation into the matter.
Below their note the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> runs its statement of principles: "Our mission is to
provide the news, information, analysis and commentary [<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX>] need to lead
successful lives and to be effective <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> in a democracy."
