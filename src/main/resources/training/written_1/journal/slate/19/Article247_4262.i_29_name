            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Angeles Times</ENAMEX> leads with "an ominous turn" in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indian Airlines</ENAMEX>
hijacking: the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX>' escalation of their demands to a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$200 million</NUMEX> ransom
and the release, not of the previously reported <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pakistani</ENAMEX> guerrilla, but of
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX>. They also want the exhumation and return from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> of a dead
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">comrade</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> leads with a report that because of the general reluctance to fly
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this coming New Year</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eve</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>'s domestic airspace will be nearly
empty--<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 45</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">airliners</ENAMEX> will be aloft--when the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next millennium</TIMEX> hits. The
Wall Street Journal front-page business news box
flags its story reporting that in part because of the major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">airlines</ENAMEX>' lower
flight volumes, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> are cutting their earnings estimates. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> ' top non-local story
is <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Act II</ENAMEX> of its lead <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> about an ultra-religious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX>'s possible
defection from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX>'s coalition <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> explains
that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prime Minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ehud Barak</ENAMEX> coaxed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> to stay by pledging more
funding for its state-subsidized religious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>. The top non-local story at
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> is the latest stage of its
presidential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> psychling tour: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Gore</ENAMEX>, Part <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>. Save for the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> 's fronting of the hijacking, none of the fronts runs anybody else's
top story.

            The WP chronicles <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1969</TIMEX> internal struggle over the military draft. The
paper says he decided to enlist in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Army</ENAMEX> primarily because he didn't want to
doom his anti-war <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> re-election bid and because he wanted to
preserve his own political viability. The story reveals <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> turned down a
relative's offer to get him into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alabama National Guard</ENAMEX>.

            The USAT front-page "cover story," upon reviewing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 1,500</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">personnel</ENAMEX> decisions made at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Defense</ENAMEX>, concludes that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> regularly grants security clearances to civilian <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> of defense
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">contractor companies</ENAMEX> who have prior criminal convictions and/or long histories of
financial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">irresponsibility</ENAMEX> or substance abuse. Recent grantees include, says
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>, a convicted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">murderer</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> convicted of sex offenses against a
minor, and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who participated in a scheme to defraud the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">million</ENAMEX>.

            The LAT front reports that many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asian-American</ENAMEX> computer entrepreneurs
in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> complain that their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> are being unfairly singled out by
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> to pay "ozone tax," a levy on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">items</ENAMEX> made with ozone-destroying <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemicals</ENAMEX>.
The story says that even though many of these local small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> have been
forced to pay up, some of the region's biggest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporations</ENAMEX>--<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mattel</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sharp</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Electronics</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atlantic Richfield</ENAMEX>, for instance--have never been
ozone-audited. And, says the paper, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> hasn't either. The story quotes a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> saying he'd never heard of the ozone tax.

            The papers all go inside with the decision of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Seattle</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mayor</ENAMEX> to cancel the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>'s planned gala <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">millennium</TIMEX> celebration. The main reasons cited: the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTO</ENAMEX>-inspired unrest and the recent capture at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> border of a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> trying to smuggle in materials for large bombs.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAT</ENAMEX> report inside that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> were
arrested <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX> on child abandonment charges after they left their severely
disabled <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> in a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Delaware</ENAMEX> hospital <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> with a note saying they could no longer
afford to care for him. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX> report, is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">CEO</ENAMEX> of a chemical
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> says the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> does <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$500 million</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> sales
while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAT</ENAMEX> says <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$380 million</NUMEX>.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> editorializes against a provocative new procedure being
implemented by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fairfax County</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Va.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX>: The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> is planning to
hand out cards to crime <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witnesses</ENAMEX> advising them that they have the
right to refuse media interviews.

            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Papers</ENAMEX> is refreshed by the periodic unflacked appearance of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lowell</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bergman</ENAMEX>'s byline in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> . (He's in the paper <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> with a workaday
story of an arms <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealer</ENAMEX>'s arrest.) After all, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bergman</ENAMEX>, a contract <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">player</ENAMEX> at the
Times , is portrayed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Pacino</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Insider</ENAMEX> and a lesser
outfit would have plugged that fact to the (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mira</ENAMEX>)max.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clayton Moore</ENAMEX>, who played TV's "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lone Ranger</ENAMEX>" in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the '40s and '50s</TIMEX>, died
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX>. It's a measure of boomer media dominance that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moore</ENAMEX> is given a
lengthy obit at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> and a front-page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> .
