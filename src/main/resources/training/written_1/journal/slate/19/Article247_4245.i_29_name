               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX>'s signing bonuses : <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Gore</ENAMEX> proposes to meet the rising demand
for new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> by creating what he calls a "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">21st Century National Teachers Corps</ENAMEX>." Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">75,000</NUMEX> talented
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> he hopes to attract to teaching <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each year</TIMEX>, he thinks <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60,000</NUMEX> should be
new college <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">graduates</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15,000</NUMEX> should be "mid-career <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX>" who want
to change jobs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> wants to attract bright and talented <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in both
categories by giving them hefty signing bonuses. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last Friday</TIMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nightline</ENAMEX> debate, he indicated that he would set the bounty at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$10,000</NUMEX> a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX>.

            What a poor use of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$750 million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> that would be. There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tens of</NUMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of capable college <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">graduates</ENAMEX> as well as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-</TIMEX>career <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX> who
would love nothing more than to become public-school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> either for a few
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> or longer. But they can't become public-school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX>. What prevents
them isn't the insufficient pay, the low social status, or the emotionally
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">taxing</ENAMEX> work. It's the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unions</ENAMEX>, which maintain powerful barriers to
entry in the form of certification requirements. This means that if you're a
smart young college <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">graduate</ENAMEX> or a bored <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> or a retired-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Army</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colonel</ENAMEX>
who wants to teach in a public school, you can't do so without obtaining
credits in education. And because education <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX> are a colossal waste of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>, many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who would make wonderful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> never get the
opportunity.

            The idea of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peace Corps</ENAMEX>-type program fueled by big signing bonuses seems
odd in any case. If <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> really wants to attract more talented <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to
careers in teaching, he needs to do <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> things he's not doing. He needs to
appeal to the idealism of those he wants to recruit by telling them that they
can make more money elsewhere but that they can do more for society by becoming
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX>. And he needs to prevent his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">allies</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unions</ENAMEX> from
continuing to serve as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gatekeepers</ENAMEX> to the profession.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain</ENAMEX>'s tax breaks : <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain</ENAMEX> always gets a chuckle for his line that a
good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> shouldn't be paid less than a bad <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senator</ENAMEX>. But his plan for
rewarding good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> is wackier than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX>'s and much more foolish. According
to an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX> story, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain</ENAMEX> plans to spend <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1 billion</NUMEX> on income-tax cuts for the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nation</ENAMEX>'s best <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX>. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> rated "excellent" might get a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25 percent</NUMEX>
income tax credit. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain</ENAMEX> apparently thinks this will produce a helpful kind of
competition in the public <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>.

            Merit pay, like alternate certification, is a sound idea that has been
blocked by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unions</ENAMEX>, which instead want more pay for everybody. But
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain</ENAMEX> has come up with an ass-backward method of inflicting merit pay--an idea
that's awful for so many reasons one almost doesn't know where to begin
criticizing it. The biggest problem is that once you start trying to shape
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>'s career choices through the tax code--awarding tax-favored status to
some professions and not others--you're on an express <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX> to hell. Why
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> but not social <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>? Why social <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> but not <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurses</ENAMEX>? Why nurses
and not <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX>? And indeed, why <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> at public <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> and not <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> at
private and parochial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>--where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain</ENAMEX> wants <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> to be able to go
with the help of federally funded vouchers. With this idea, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain</ENAMEX>, who casts
himself as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arch-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foe</ENAMEX> of the special interests in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>, has devised an
entirely new form of favoritism for special interests to pursue.
