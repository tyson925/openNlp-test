            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Guys</ENAMEX>,

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> last thing, if you can bear with me: I've been meaning <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all week</TIMEX> to mount
the case for <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Sixth Sense</ENAMEX> , a film <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audiences</ENAMEX> loved and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> liked,
sortakinda, but seemed to worry about liking too much. In my opinion, The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sixth Sense</ENAMEX> is every bit as ambitious and provocative, and in some ways
more fully realized, than <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Three Kings</ENAMEX> . Let's start with the small gifts
of this movie, the little things it attempts that so few <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> movies ever
bother with. The urban backdrop: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tak Fujimoto</ENAMEX>'s sublimely subtle, atmospheric
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cinematography</ENAMEX> made <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philadelphia</ENAMEX> look ancient, decadent, well-worn; rarely does
an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">film</ENAMEX> setting feel so saturated with the past and teeming with the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">footprints</ENAMEX> left by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier generations</TIMEX>. Then there's the low-key honesty about
class--the contrast between <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce Willis</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">psychologist</ENAMEX>, a posterboy gentrifier
in a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">townhouse</ENAMEX> stuffed with antiques, and the wonderful <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Toni Colette</ENAMEX>'s
struggling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mom</ENAMEX>. With just a few quick strokes, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer-director</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. N. Shyamalan</ENAMEX>
paints a totally authentic-feeling picture of yuppiedom--its decent intentions,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">complacency</ENAMEX>, and loneliness--and I didn't see a less whitewashed or sensational
portrait of working-class <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> life <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX>. (As opposed to the voyeuristic
Rosetta , where the camera pants after the poor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heroine</ENAMEX>, cornering her
like a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pig</ENAMEX> in a pen and treating her vulnerability as a turn-on--an occasion
for a kind of art-house porn.) As for the famous trick ending, it is not a
trick so much as the solution to a problem the film has been posing all along.
The film has such a fragmented point of view, it's like a rigorously worked-out
cubist canvas, except that unlike a cubist, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shyamalan</ENAMEX> moves through the
fragments to a new level of clarity. I may be jumping to conclusions based on
the fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shayamalan</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX>, but The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Sixth Sense</ENAMEX> strikes
me as philosophically rather complicated, and possibly in dialogue with some
non-Western ideas you don't get to see too often in films, unless they're
uttered in egregiously bad faith by a wisecracking, turban-wearing showboat
like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whoopi Goldberg</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robin Williams</ENAMEX>. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> felt that toward the end,
the ghosts became too unthreatening, too adorable--and here I admit they had a
point. On the other hand, I don't think this was just pandering. Death is
everywhere in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Sixth Sense</ENAMEX> ; the point of the film, unusually wise for
a blockbuster, is that death is inevitable, and not an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enemy</ENAMEX>.

            I wanted to thank you, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David</ENAMEX>, for passing the piece by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel Menaker</ENAMEX>. It was as excellent as promised--and yet the pace of change
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these days</TIMEX> is quick. Even since he wrote that piece <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few months ago</TIMEX>, Being
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Malkovich</ENAMEX> has come out, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Boys</ENAMEX> Don't Cry , and a few other
movies which taken together suggest that breaking through to the real is
no longer such a priority. Compared with these films, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Truman Show</ENAMEX> ,
with its paranoid and simplistic pursuit of innocence, already feels 15 years
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">old</ENAMEX>. In fact, the best films <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> no longer placed much stock in reality
at all. They leapt into gray areas, where human beings behaved like machines
( The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Matrix</ENAMEX> ) and machines demonstrated human potential (I'm thinking of
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iron Giant</ENAMEX> , and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">talent</ENAMEX> for sculpture.) They leapt, suddenly,
from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> of reality to another (the freeze frames on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tracy Flick</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">deformed</ENAMEX>, mid-motion face in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Election</TIMEX> , the sudden abstracted shots in
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Kings</ENAMEX> where a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> ceased to be a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> and became the pathway
for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bullet</ENAMEX> and a haven for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">microbes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>.) They explored the problem
of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">souls</ENAMEX>, same model <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> (the duplicate <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buzz Lightyear</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">in Toy Story</ENAMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soul</ENAMEX>, too many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> ( Being <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Malkovich</ENAMEX> ). They
explored the problem of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soul</ENAMEX> attempting to will its wishes into being, even
when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> can't easily accommodate them ( <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Boys Don't Cry , The</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Sixth Sense</ENAMEX> .) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Body</ENAMEX> and soul: This, it seems to me, is the problem that
inspired the best moments in the best films of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>. This was fun. I'd
especially like to thank you, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David</ENAMEX>--the most generous and stimulating of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hosts</ENAMEX>.
