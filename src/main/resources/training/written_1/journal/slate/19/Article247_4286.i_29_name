            I'm not as thoroughly dismissive of public journalism as you are, but I
think we end up in the same place. To give this dialogue the semblance of a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fair</ENAMEX> fight, allow me to delineate at least some things that I think <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosen</ENAMEX> and
his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">allies</ENAMEX> get right.

            

               <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> journalism, especially print journalism, is in crisis. For most of
the mainstream <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">press audiences</ENAMEX> have been shrinking for some time. Serious
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">journalism</ENAMEX> has become difficult to do in many places, and some wonder whether
it's worth doing.

               Coverage of most political campaigns is poor and tends to focus on trivial
matters. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Every year</TIMEX>, there are probably <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozens</NUMEX> of exceptions to this rule, but
it seems fundamentally right to me.

               <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Journalists</ENAMEX>, as a class, seem removed from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> they cover.
Again, there are exceptions, especially in small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX>, but I think it's pretty
rare to see community board meetings overflowing with local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalists</ENAMEX> out to
better their neighborhoods.

               Coverage of political issues too often gels around easy, conflict-based
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">poles</ENAMEX>, to the detriment of anyone's understanding. I see this especially on
television.

            

            It's hard to tell from reading <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosen</ENAMEX>, but one can believe all these things
and still not subscribe to the philosophy of public journalism. (Indeed, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosen</ENAMEX>
often writes as if there were no significant criticism of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> journalism
until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about 1989</TIMEX>.)

            Where I think <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosen</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> begin to fall down is with the assumptions
that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) these problems are the result of current journalistic theory and
practice, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) it is the urgent responsibility of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalists</ENAMEX> to change the
nature of what they do.

            There are many, many <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">darts</ENAMEX> to be thrown at these assumptions, but I'll start
with one of the sharpest: The crisis of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> journalism to which public
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">journalism</ENAMEX> responded was largely an economic crisis. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosen</ENAMEX>'s school flourished
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early-'90s</TIMEX> recession, when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX> were folding, budgets were being
slashed, and the Net was a place for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wizards</ENAMEX> to swap software wands. Change
those economic facts, and the need for public journalism recedes
remarkably.

            Until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jim</ENAMEX>
