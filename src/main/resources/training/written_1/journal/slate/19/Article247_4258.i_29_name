               Introduction
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chatterbox</ENAMEX>'s request that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> submit nominations for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Annual</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Heller Memorial Clich√</ENAMEX>© Contest  yielded a huge response. What
explains <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Web</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX>' great interest in clich√©s? Perhaps it's a rebellion
against the printing press, a technology whose usefulness is now being
challenged by the Internet. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clich√©</ENAMEX>,
which (according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Oxford English Dictionary</ENAMEX>) is <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">French</ENAMEX> for "to click,"
refers to the "striking of melted lead in order to obtain a proof or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cast</ENAMEX>."
That is, it describes a process of  printmaking in which a metal plate is cast
from something else (a woodcut, a plaster mold) and then used to make copies.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> term for this process is stereotype , which has acquired a similar
pejorative meaning. Of course, Web aficionados should take care not to be
too scornful of the old-style
printing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">press</ENAMEX>'s capacity to reproduce images ad <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">absurdum</ENAMEX> , since the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Web</ENAMEX> has vastly
expanded it. Indeed, it's quite possible that in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next century</TIMEX> the terms
"clich√©" and "stereotype" will be supplanted by new terms derived from the
Internet. We may find ourselves saying: "I'm sick to death of  html like 'be there in a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Jose</ENAMEX> minute" or:
"<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Androids</ENAMEX> resent being homepaged as
unfeeling simply because they're manufactured rather than born." In the
meantime, clich√©-obsessed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> may wish to consult the many clich√©-oriented
sites available on the Web. These include the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Clich√© Finder; The Book of</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clich√©s; Cirque de Clich√©</ENAMEX> ;
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clich√©s; Sports</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clich√©s; Movie</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clich√©s;  Dutch Clich√©s</ENAMEX>; and the Web page of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">David</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clich√©</ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quebecois</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX>.  

            
               A <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Word About Method:</ENAMEX>
            

            Although some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> submitted citations along with their entries, per
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chatterbox</ENAMEX>'s request, most did not. Also, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX>' methods for counting
citations varied greatly--some used <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Nexis</ENAMEX>, some used <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Jones News Retrieval</ENAMEX>,
some used <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Yahoo</ENAMEX>, and so on. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chatterbox</ENAMEX> took the advice of reader
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Josh Green</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">graduate</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwestern</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medill School of Journalism</ENAMEX>, which every <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">summer</TIMEX>
calculates <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX>'s biggest political clich√© by using the search engine for
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congressional</ENAMEX>
Record . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chatterbox</ENAMEX> took the better entries from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> and plugged
them into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Record</ENAMEX> 's search engine
to see how often they were uttered in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between Jan. 1 and Dec. 27</TIMEX>,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>.

             
               And the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Winner Is ...</ENAMEX>
            

            "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Inappropriate</ENAMEX> ," submitted by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas E. Ricks</ENAMEX>,* defense <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> and author
of Making the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corps</ENAMEX> . This term made more appearances in
the Congressional Record (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">382</ENAMEX>) than
any other word or phrase nominated (at least among the ones Chatterbox bothered
to check). "Inappropriate" easily outstripped "evil," a word that appeared in
the Congressional Record <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a mere 250</NUMEX>
times, though--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Bennett</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gertrude Himmelfarb</ENAMEX>, and other denouncers of
moral relativism take note-- it still lagged behind "wrong," which appeared in
excess of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">999</NUMEX> times (the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CR</ENAMEX> search
engine doesn't count beyond <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> digits).

            What was inappropriate in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>?
The designation of several non-emergency categories of spending as emergency
spending (according to a resolution submitted by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sens.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phil Gramm</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Olympia</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Snowe</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Russell Feingold</ENAMEX>); proposed oil drilling along the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> coast
(according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Randy "Duke" Cunningham</ENAMEX>); <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Clinton</ENAMEX>'s relationship with
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monica Lewinsky</ENAMEX> (according to a resolution submitted by several <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democratic</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senators</ENAMEX>); lots of arts funded by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Endowment for the Arts</ENAMEX>
(according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ron Packard</ENAMEX>); sex between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> (according to
a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> resolution endorsed by just about everybody that apparently came out of
a broadcast by radio therapist <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laura Schlessinger</ENAMEX>); and many, many other things.

            It must be said, however, that the rate at which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> is deeming things
"inappropriate " is down slightly
from the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997-8</TIMEX> session, when during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a two-year</TIMEX> period the word "inappropriate " appeared in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CR</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">824</NUMEX> times. To hold steady, "inappropriate " would have had to appear <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">412</NUMEX>
times.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Runners-up</ENAMEX>:
            

            "At <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the day</TIMEX> " is a
phrase that drove several 
                  Slate
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers bonkers</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chatterbox</ENAMEX> had thought it old hat (it dates back at least to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>
administration), but the phrase appeared <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">272</NUMEX> times in the CR database for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>, ranking it <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> among
all submissions. That's an increase
in its frequency of appearance over the previous congressional session, when
the word was uttered <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 401</NUMEX> times during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a two-year</TIMEX> period. At this rate,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawmakers</ENAMEX> will end up talking about the
end of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">544</NUMEX> times before the current session ends in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Dec. 2000</TIMEX>. Many
thanks to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Moran</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Darren Thorneycroft</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nicholas Lemann*</ENAMEX> (author
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">The Big Test</ENAMEX> ) for flagging this one.

            "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Robust</ENAMEX> " came in <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> among
words and phrases submitted (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">220</NUMEX> citations in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CR</ENAMEX> ), and unlike <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the previous two</TIMEX>, it seems to
be a genuinely new clich√©; at any
rate, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chatterbox</ENAMEX> hadn't previously been aware of its overuse.  Like "at the end
of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX>," its use is on the upswing (one might even call it robust) , with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 336</NUMEX> citations during the
previous congressional session. According to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Burke</ENAMEX>, who submitted
"robust ," it is

            

               
                  The most overused, overworked,
hackneyed word in the cliche-ridden vocabulary of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pols</ENAMEX> and their speechwriters,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">D.C.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bureaucrats</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">think-tank thinkers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pundits</ENAMEX> and even lowly working reporters
condemned to write about legislation and policy making. You know, everything
has to be robust <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">now</TIMEX>: a robust foreign policy, a robust national defense, a
robust air attack on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Serbia</ENAMEX>, a robust <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">police</ENAMEX> crackdown, a robust anti-drug
policy, a robust investigation of abuses.  Most political activities are
robust, too: a robust campaign, a robust fundraising program, a robust reponse
to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX>, a robust position on you-name-it.
               

            

            Agreed.

            
               Clich√©s to watch in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>:
            

            Many excellent nominations failed to garner as many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CR</ENAMEX> citations as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chatterbox</ENAMEX> expected. These
include: "wake-up call" (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">46</NUMEX>); "above my pay grade" (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">41</NUMEX>); "paralysis by
analysis" (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>); "new facts on the ground" (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>); and "mano a mano " (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>), which, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jay Brida</ENAMEX>
pointed out, is always misused (it's <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> not for "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>," but "hand to
hand"). These are all comers, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chatterbox</ENAMEX>'s view.
