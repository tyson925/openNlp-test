            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dear Jack</ENAMEX>,

            I'm glad you picked up on the alternative newspaper question, for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two</TIMEX>
reasons. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX>, it spotlights the frustrating limits of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosen</ENAMEX>'s definitions of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">journalism</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalists</ENAMEX>. There is nary a mention in this thick book of any
of the leading "alternative" <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">weeklies</ENAMEX>, which are often stuffed with material
that one might expect to intrigue <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosen</ENAMEX>. There's also little mention of
national <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazines</ENAMEX>, whether specialized political ones or big general-interest
ones. There's almost no attention paid to radio, where <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds of</NUMEX> of excellent
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalists</ENAMEX> work, and only at the end does <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosen</ENAMEX> acknowledge the
development of the Internet as a news medium. Even television doesn't get much
play here, at least not compared with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> it garners in real life. In
other words: For someone with as sweeping and academic-seeming a criticism as
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rosen's</ENAMEX>, he's done a poor job of defining the terms of what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalists</ENAMEX> do,
where they work, and how they operate.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX>, as you indicate, "alternative" <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX> have been thriving, many for
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX>, by providing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> with exactly the kind of service <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosen</ENAMEX> says he
wants: reporting with perspective; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> inclusion; making stories into
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">crusades</ENAMEX>; etc. Their "success" in doing so is of course debatable, but it makes
you wonder: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Has Rosen</ENAMEX> simply never read those papers? Or is he avoiding using
them as models? My guess is the latter. I'll bet it's a prestige problem. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pew Charitable Trust</ENAMEX> and the other purse strings of public journalism
would scream: "We didn't cough up <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">several million dollars</NUMEX> so you could tell the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">media</ENAMEX> to behave like the goddamned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Village Voice</ENAMEX> ."

            That said, I think you're being awfully sanguine about the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">media</ENAMEX>. I find most <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX> to be quite bad; to argue that they
might once have been worse is neither reassuring nor really the point. Most
television journalism is horrendous, and some is actually harmful (by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">misinforming</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewers</ENAMEX> about crime, for example). Either you want that situation
to change or you don't, but denying it seems silly.

            You're also arguing against <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">straw</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> of your own creation: A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalist</ENAMEX>
does not need to have a "lunch-pail and straphanger" <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> in order to be
out of touch. Pick up a copy of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Miami Herald</ENAMEX> (or, for that matter,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">San Francisco Chronicle</ENAMEX> ), and tell me with a straight face that
those <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX> are doing the best job they can to reflect and report life in
those <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>. Remind me which prime-time network news show it is that deals
with immigration, public education, workplace discrimination, and how to solve
health and child-care problems. Seems to me that whenever I tune in I am asked
to contemplate "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Miracle of Sextuplets</ENAMEX>."

            As for presidential politics, we agree that poor coverage is not exclusively
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX>'s fault, or even principally its fault. But it also seems a cop-out
to say that if the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> don't disagree, then there's no way to cover the
issues. I don't think that some of the experiments in this book are all that
bad for that kind of coverage. That is, start with local issues; in my
neighborhood, they include <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX>, homelessness, housing prices, and the need for
a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Second Avenue</ENAMEX> subway. Then look to what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> can offer (skeptically, of
course, since the real story may be that these problems elude <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solutions</ENAMEX> on the
presidential level). If they don't disagree <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> iota, then maybe there's a
political problem, but I don't think there would be a problem producing good or
interesting journalism. I suspect, by the way, that the better <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> papers
will do something like this as the primary approaches, though they won't call
it public journalism.
