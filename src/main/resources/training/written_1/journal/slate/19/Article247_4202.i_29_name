            The promise of the Internet, from a business perspective, is the promise of
a frictionless economy, in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sellers</ENAMEX> are able to meet without
mediation. And since perhaps the most disliked <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediators</ENAMEX> out there are car
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX>, they would seem to be natural and inevitable casualties of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX>'
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">migration</ENAMEX> to the Internet. Very few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> like bargaining with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX>.
Auto <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> don't like their now-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost</NUMEX>-required reliance on rebates to move
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX>. And the whole phenomenon of the huge <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">dealership</ENAMEX>, with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">acres</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX>, each
depreciating by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the minute</TIMEX>, seems like an archaic way of handling distribution
(and, since someone has to make all those <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX>, production).

            At the same time, the smartest <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">auto</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturers</ENAMEX>, like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toyota</ENAMEX>, are
already working hard at integrating the Internet into their operations and
developing build-to-order systems. Eventually, you should be able to
communicate directly with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX>, pick out the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> you want with the options you
want, and have it delivered to your door, just like a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dell</ENAMEX> PC. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> won't have
to make <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> it's not going to be able to sell, and you won't have to haggle
with some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealer</ENAMEX>. (This was what I was imagining at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the end of the last</TIMEX>
Moneybox, when I wrote about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> truly becoming an Internet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>.)

            The only problem with this picture of the future is that it's currently
against the law. Just about every <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, in fact, has
strong franchise laws that limit the size and scope of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">dealerships</ENAMEX>, effectively
regulate the allocation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicles</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX>, bar large-volume discounts, and
prevent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX> from selling across state lines. Needless to say, actually
buying a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> on the Internet is therefore impossible, which is why all the
car-buying services on the Net are actually local filtering devices, allowing
you to comparison-shop. That's an obvious advance over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the old days</TIMEX>, but it's
still a long way from a real Internet market.

            In essence, local <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX> have been able to create and maintain
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">geographic</ENAMEX> oligopolies through the use of franchise laws. That's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> reason why
the category-killer approach to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>-selling, exemplified by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">AutoNation</ENAMEX> (which
just announced it was closing its used-car <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">superstores</ENAMEX>), has floundered so
badly. If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wal-Mart</ENAMEX> weren't able to offer lower prices in its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> because it
was barred from getting volume discounts from its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">suppliers</ENAMEX>, it would hardly be
a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">powerhouse retailer</ENAMEX>. Economics of scale come into play only if things get
cheaper the bigger you get. Otherwise you've just got more overhead.

            But while the demise of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">superstore</ENAMEX> should probably be lamented, the
really nefarious impact of the state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">franchise</ENAMEX> laws is unquestionably on the
not-yet-existing Net market. Those laws are in part a product of older concerns
about vertical integration, so that they served the function of keeping the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">auto-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">makers</ENAMEX> from selling direct to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX>. And they also allow <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> to
keep a tight grip on the tax revenue from auto sales. But they are almost
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">textbook</ENAMEX> examples of bad regulation, which accomplish nothing but putting lots
of money in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX>' pockets.

            Even if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>, say, were to pass a law permitting the direct sale of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX>, that wouldn't mean that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">auto-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">makers</ENAMEX> would embrace direct selling
immediately. An article in the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fast Company</ENAMEX> , for instance, suggests
that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toyota</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> was hesitant to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Web</ENAMEX>-ify the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> precisely because
it was afraid that would lead to direct sales, which would alienate dealers
(and break the law). And it's plausible that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> is such a big purchase that
many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are going to be uncomfortable buying one online, sight unseen. But
as an alternative, one can easily imagine something like what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gateway</ENAMEX> does now
with its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Country Stores</ENAMEX>, where you can test-drive a PC and then order it
immediately online. There will, of course, be auto <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturers</ENAMEX> that even a
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decade from now</TIMEX> are still working through the traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealer</ENAMEX> system. But if
you look at the PC industry, and the difference between the success of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">direct-selling Dell</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gateway</ENAMEX> and the struggles of dealer-centric <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Compaq</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX>, the idea that those <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">auto</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturers</ENAMEX> who stay tied to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX> will
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">flourish</ENAMEX> seems dubious indeed.

            Of course, first all those laws have to be changed.
