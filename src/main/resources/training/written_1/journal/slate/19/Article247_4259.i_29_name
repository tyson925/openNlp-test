            The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Angeles Times</ENAMEX> lead with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>'s decision to negotiate with the
hijackers of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indian Airlines</ENAMEX> flight, still on the tarmac in southern
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York</ENAMEX>
Times reports that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shas</ENAMEX> party may quit the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>'s ruling
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coalition</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Skeptics</ENAMEX> say the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> is crying wolf. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA Today</ENAMEX> 's lead reveals
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gov.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George W. Bush</ENAMEX>'s strategy for making up the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX>-point lead held by Gov.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John McCain</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Hampshire</ENAMEX>: He will spend time there. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX>
"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">World-Wide"</ENAMEX> column leads with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX>'s stalled drive into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grozny</ENAMEX> and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indian Airlines</ENAMEX> negotiations.

            The deadline set by hijackers for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> to respond to demands passed without
any more bloodshed, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX> report. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX>, they had threatened to kill
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> at a time until <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> released an imprisoned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kashmiri</ENAMEX> separatist
and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> has retreated from its position of not talking to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">terrorists</ENAMEX>, but negotiations have failed to resolve the standoff thus far, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> reports. Meanwhile, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX>, anxious for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> to leave
their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, have vowed to kill the hijackers if they hurt any more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hostages</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX>, which has assigned the story to the rewrite desk for the last
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two days</TIMEX>, runs an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Associated Press</ENAMEX> story inside <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisers</ENAMEX> told the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAT</ENAMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX> will spend about two
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Hampshire</ENAMEX> between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Jan. 4 and Feb. 1</TIMEX>, the date of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>'s
presidential primary. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX>'s appearances will largely take the form of
"town hall" meetings. Judging by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain</ENAMEX>'s success, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Hampshire</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> prefer
more interactive settings, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> reports.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> waits until the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> paragraph from the end to reveal the
presumed catalyst for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israeli</ENAMEX> religious <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">block</ENAMEX>'s threat to quit Prime
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ehud Barak</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>. Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the weekend</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">finance minister</ENAMEX>
agreed to fund the budget requests of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> other religious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX>, proving to
Shas that its help is not critical. Shas begs to differ. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Orthodox</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX>,
which has been the shakiest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barak</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">coalition</ENAMEX> from the beginning,
demands more anti-poverty programs and relief for its debt-ridden religious
school system.

            Internet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pharmacies</ENAMEX> will soon fall under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX>'s scrutiny, the papers
report. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX> budget will seek <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$10 million</NUMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> to
hire <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> and buy technology that will pick out suspicious online prescription
drug <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sellers</ENAMEX>. At present, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> are responsible for inspecting pharmacies
within their borders. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> wants to get involved now too, since it's
possible, if not routine, for prescribers, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pharmacists</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> to live in
different <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> story ends with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VP</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">PlanetRx</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">com</ENAMEX>
claiming, predictably, that the new regulation is unnecessary; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX>
doesn't talk to any online pharmacy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>.

            Tobacco industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> filed an <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">89</NUMEX>-page document meant to halt a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX>'s suit filed to retrieve government health-care costs, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> report. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> argue that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> have
already agreed to reshape tobacco marketing in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$240</NUMEX>
billion settlement with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>. They also cite <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>' decision to put
warnings on cigarettes and tax them, rather than seek legal liability. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX> will file an answer by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Feb. 25</TIMEX>, but due to the case's
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">complexity</ENAMEX>, it may not go to trial until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 2003</TIMEX>.

            The LAT fronts and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> runs inside stories on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX>'
attempts <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> to overturn a ruling that denied bail to former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los Alamos</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">physicist Wen Ho Lee</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defendant</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> argued that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX>, charged on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">59</NUMEX>
counts of mishandling secret documents, never acted with criminal intent. A
computer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX> told the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> that the files <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> removed from the system "were
open to not very sophisticated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hackers</ENAMEX> on the Internet," the LAT
reports.

            Estimates of the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Chechen</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">fighters</ENAMEX> left in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Grozny</ENAMEX> are growning as
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX>'s advance into the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> slows. The figure is said to fall <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between 2,000</NUMEX>
and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,000</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX>, a rise from the equivocal <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,500</NUMEX> mentioned in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chechen</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aslan Maskhadov</ENAMEX> is cited in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> as willing to fight to the last, but an unnamed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chechen</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commander</ENAMEX>
told the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Associated Press</ENAMEX> (in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WSJ</ENAMEX>) that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> thinks the
resistance in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Grozny</ENAMEX> can keep up <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">just two or three more weeks</TIMEX>. The LAT
off-lead focuses on a detail mentioned in the other papers' accounts: The
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> military has been dropping on southern <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chechnya fuel</ENAMEX>-air bombs, which
release a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> into the air that then ignites. The device can reach <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in
sheltered areas, like <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">basements</ENAMEX> or, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chechens'case</ENAMEX>, caves. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> story carries a dateline from  the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> Pobedinskoe, a name derived
from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Russian</ENAMEX> word for "victory"--an ironic contrast to the headline above
it, "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Assault on Grozny Stalled</ENAMEX>."

            
               Zip it, zip it good: A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Science Times</ENAMEX>" article unzips a
new use for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a 106-year-old</TIMEX> invention. Instead of stapling or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stitching</ENAMEX> surgical
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">wounds</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> can now affix paper strips to either side of an incision and
gently pull them together with a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">polyethylene zipper</ENAMEX>. One enthusiastic patient
sounds as if he'd just leaped out of an infomercial: "I had surgery on my chest
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few years ago</TIMEX> and it was closed with staples, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> was it painful. With
the zipper, I had no pain at all." <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Papers</ENAMEX> is so impressed that he will
buy <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> of them.
