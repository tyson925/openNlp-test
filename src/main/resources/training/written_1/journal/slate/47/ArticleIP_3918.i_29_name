            By my count, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> double
issues (at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks</TIMEX> per issue) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> special issues (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one week</TIMEX> each) total
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15 weeks</TIMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">28 percent</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>. Is it so impressive that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">28 percent</NUMEX> of the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> accounted for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35 percent</NUMEX> of the ad pages?

            I'm
reminded of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dilbert</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boss</ENAMEX>, who was outraged to find that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40 percent</NUMEX> of company

talent, either by firing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, forcing them out, or forcing them <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> to
throw up and then to give up. You're right about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX>'s sameness,
however; it's the same damn thing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each week</TIMEX>, and it's the same as the other

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">particle</ENAMEX> called a neutrino, which is chargeless and was formerly thought
massless too, in fact has mass. The papers assure us this is earth-shaking.
"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Universe May Never Be the Same</ENAMEX>" is slugged over <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT Universe</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">reporter Malcolm Browne</ENAMEX>'s dispatch. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> says the discovery was

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Science</ENAMEX> reporting in the

nothing. Well, these little nothings called neutrinos have a lot to say, if
only we could find a press willing to pass on the message. I applaud the New
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">York Times</ENAMEX> for trying to convey some of that excitement and say woe to you
for dipping to such cynicism. Uncharacteristic, I might add.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Epstein</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 3</TIMEX> comments on organ peddling (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">"Dialogue"</ENAMEX>):

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Epstein</ENAMEX> writes: "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Better</ENAMEX>
that we have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> alive with one kidney each than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> alive with
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> kidneys." I mention that point to my medical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">150</NUMEX> presumably
healthy young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>) <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every year</TIMEX> in an effort to get them to agree to a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">utilitarian</ENAMEX> plan making it mandatory to remove one kidney from each of them to
be made available for donation. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Every year</TIMEX> they reject this plan. Something
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about</TIMEX> personal autonomy being more important than utilitarian calculus in
certain situations. It just may be they are right--that utilitarian math may
not be the highest virtue when dealing with organ procurement (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> murder could
net two kidneys as we are likely to find out from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> prisoner
situation--should we trade <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> life for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>?).

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Epstein</ENAMEX> writes: "Look it
up on the Web. ... If it is possible to do this kind of research with standard
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">illnesses</ENAMEX>, it should be possible to do it with organ transplants." The point
being that access to good information fosters legal markets. The Web example
proves just the opposite: Much of the information <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> get about <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX> on
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Web</ENAMEX> is incomplete, imprecise, or just plain wrong. There is absolutely no
guarantee that good information will create legitimate markets for organ sales.
The likelihood is the opposite--that bad (misleading, coercive) information
will be disseminated to entice <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to sell their organs and ignore the very
real risks that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> incur when they give up their organs. (Donating organs
can bring consequences to the donor far more momentous than buying a fake <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rolex</ENAMEX>
on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Fifth Avenue</ENAMEX>.)

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) How
would such markets ever be regulated? No regulation? Without some screening
(who will the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brokers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">middlemen</ENAMEX> be?), not only will <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX> suffer (see
above) but some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX> will receive unsuitable organs. While <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Epstein</ENAMEX> can
argue that this happens currently, consider what wholesale expansion of an
unregulated market would bring in terms of the number of complications. In
fact, there are reports that in some <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> where organs may be sold and the
process is not monitored closely, the numbers and types of infections in
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX> are much worse.

               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft Ãœber Alles</ENAMEX> ?
            

            In "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monopoly Shopping</ENAMEX>,"
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven E. Landsburg</ENAMEX> sings a paean to the vertically integrated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monopoly</ENAMEX>. He
argues mainly that including the Internet <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Explorer</ENAMEX> browser as a free part of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Windows 95</ENAMEX> operating system will ultimately benefit the consumer since a
rival <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">browser</ENAMEX> would be sold as a separate profit <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>.

            I happen to agree that one
predominant browser architecture would ultimately benefit the consumer, but for
a different reason--it would create a market standard for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">developers</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> to focus their investments. I expect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> to prevail, despite
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Netscape</ENAMEX>'s better technology and implementation and despite the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>'s
well-intentioned efforts to intervene. I would certainly hope, however, that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX> would continue to be dedicated to innovation in this arena until the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">technologies</ENAMEX> had matured to the point where they were clearly superior and
worthy of becoming a standard.

            It's odd to read this whole
economic argument in light of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Netscape</ENAMEX>'s pledge to distribute <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Navigator</ENAMEX> (and
its source code) for free in perpetuity. But even if <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Navigator</ENAMEX> were to be sold
at some point, the ultimate cost to the consumer would come not from the cost
of the browser itself, but from the ramifications of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>'s control of the
emerging desktop software interface to the internet. The focus in the browser
wars and legal wranglings has already begun to move away from browser choice
and toward the more important issues of gateways and the branded services they
feature.

            The
configuration of computers when sold will determine to a large degree which
services a consumer encounters. Note how the cable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> have profited from
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> that they carry, some of which they own fully or in
part. Note also how the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baby Bells</ENAMEX> have profited from charging for advertising
in their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yellow Pages</ENAMEX>. Consider then the value of a gateway when it contains
not just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a few dozen</NUMEX> TV <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> or local business listings, but the emerging
broadband multimedia marketplace <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">only a few years</TIMEX> away. Do we want to allow
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> to parlay its control of the desktop architecture into control of the
content that appears on the desktop?

            In his article, "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monopoly Shopping</ENAMEX>,"
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven Landsburg</ENAMEX> notes that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Windows 95</ENAMEX> costs <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $90</NUMEX> and suggests what would
happen to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> if it tried to raise the price.

            A better topic to examine is
why the price of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Windows 95</ENAMEX> hasn't come down in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three years</TIMEX> on the market.

            My
understanding of the economies of scale suggests the Windows iterations being
produced <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> should be costing <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">less</NUMEX> to produce than the first ones that
entered the pipeline. Prices of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intel</ENAMEX> processors, laser printers, fax machines,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">etc.</ENAMEX>, all drop as the learning/production curve results in lower costs. Why not
Windows <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">95</TIMEX>? Could the lack of competition have anything to do with it?

            "In God He ...
," <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brent Staples</ENAMEX>' review of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Titan</ENAMEX>: The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Life</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John D. Rockefeller Sr.</ENAMEX>
perpetuates a few misconceptions about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Standard Oil</ENAMEX>'s business practices.

            For example, he repeats the
myth that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Standard</ENAMEX> pursued a "predatory pricing" strategy (though that was
indeed among the charges brought against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Standard</ENAMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>).
Though <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Standard</ENAMEX> did indeed buy out many of its early <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">competitors</ENAMEX>, that was due
chiefly to their tremendously inefficient processes--<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Standard</ENAMEX> ended up
mothballing most of the refineries it bought, while expanding output from its
own, efficient <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX>. Furthermore, if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Standard</ENAMEX> did pursue a predatory
pricing strategy, it sure didn't work. Standard faced constant competition both
in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> and abroad throughout its corporate existence, causing the price of
oil to slope ever downward.

            <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Staples</ENAMEX> claims that
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">trust system</ENAMEX> "disallowed genuine competition." Far from it. As Chernow
himself puts it: "With additional oil strikes in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indian Territory</ENAMEX>
(later <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oklahoma</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kansas</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Illinois</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1900s</TIMEX>, the industry became
too vast and far-flung for even <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Standard Oil</ENAMEX> to control. It might not be too
much of an exaggeration to say that the antitrust cases brought against the
trust in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1900s</TIMEX> were not just belated but were fast becoming
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">superfluous</ENAMEX>." In other words, the marketplace was already bringing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Standard</ENAMEX> to
its knees, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockefeller</ENAMEX> did indeed end up "eclipsed by others"--without
government intervention.

            The reason
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">monopolies</ENAMEX> are bad is that, in theory, they lead to high prices and less
product. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Staples</ENAMEX> points out, though, that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Standard Oil</ENAMEX> provided a product which
was "consistently good--and cheaper to boot." In other words, it acted exactly
as a theoretical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monopoly</ENAMEX> should not. While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Standard</ENAMEX>'s practices may have led
to, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chernow</ENAMEX>'s words, "misery all around" for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producers</ENAMEX>, the low prices and
improved product they brought to the refining industry meant nothing but good
news for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX>.
