            After reading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alfred</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gingold</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 10</TIMEX> article, "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Onward</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Christian Clothiers</ENAMEX>," my first reaction was that ol' Alfie
should take a breath. Who doesn't go through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">everyday</TIMEX> life and see things that
disturb one's aesthetic sense? Our culture is a sloganeering one. Why should
Christianity be any different? Every <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>'s marketing strategy has an
underlying secondary message--drink <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mountain Dew</ENAMEX> and you're extreme ; buy
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tommy Hilfiger</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gingold</ENAMEX>'s example) and you're young, attractive, and not afraid
to look like every other frat <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>.

            My guess
is that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gingold</ENAMEX> doesn't get out of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> much. Here in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bible Belt</ENAMEX>, we've
learned to desensitize ourselves to the crass underbelly of organized religion.
My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> comes home from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> and tells me that other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> have come up
with alternative meanings to the WWJD acronym--"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">We Want Jelly Doughnuts</ENAMEX>,"
"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Willy Wonka Just Died</ENAMEX>," etc. There will always be <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who wear this crap
and others who get to make fun of them. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fair</ENAMEX> trade.

            I was
offended by the article "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Onward</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Christian Clothiers</ENAMEX>," even though I am not religious. The
idea that someone wearing their religion on their sleeve is someone to be

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pro-abortion</ENAMEX> T-shirts or vulgar T-shirts ("shit happens," "coed nude

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">evangelical Christian</ENAMEX> apparel. Why do overtly <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> messages bother him so

               Who
Gives a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F***</ENAMEX> About <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tina Brown</ENAMEX>?
            

            Now I'm well aware that it's
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tina Brown</ENAMEX>'s world and the rest of us are just living in it, but really, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX>,
enough's enough. 
                  Slate
               's coverage of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX>'s departure to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">La La</ENAMEX>
Land has been a tad, shall we say, excessive. It was bad enough that the
subject was covered ad <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">nauseam</ENAMEX> (and I mean ad <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">nauseam</ENAMEX>) in "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Breakfast Table</ENAMEX>" <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</TIMEX> and treated as a serious news

"

               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">'s Tina Brown Roundup</ENAMEX>," I had to wonder whether you people
have lost all perspective.

            Perhaps I'm wrong and other
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> are as endlessly fascinated with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX> as 
                  Slate
                itself
is. But I suspect many agree with me that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX>'s job change is essentially an
industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">insider</ENAMEX> story that holds little interest for those of who 1) don't
work in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> trade and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) don't hang in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>'s trendier

               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L'affaire Brown</ENAMEX> was worth maybe <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> story in

               . When
you reach the point of needing a roundup, you might want to re-examine your

Gives a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">F*** About Linda Tripp's Motives</ENAMEX>?
            

            I am at a loss to explain the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">media's</ENAMEX> (and public's) desire to understand the motives behind <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Linda Tripp</ENAMEX>'s
tape recordings, as exemplified in the "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Linda Tripp</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Victimized</ENAMEX> or
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Vicious?</ENAMEX>" dialogue between <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jonah Goldberg</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Margaret Carlson</ENAMEX>. What do her
motives matter in the context of either the investigation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> or
the investigation into her own taping?

            The importance of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tripp</ENAMEX>'s
motives is not the same as for, say, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paula Jones</ENAMEX>'--because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tripp</ENAMEX> is not the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">accuser</ENAMEX>. She has passed along tape recordings that (allegedly)
implicate the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> by the words of a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX>. Now, whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX>'s
words are truth and whether they were drawn out through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tripp</ENAMEX>'s entrapment
(which would also be on the tapes) are valid issues. But not <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tripp</ENAMEX>'s motives in
making the recordings.

            Maybe she's good, and maybe
she's bad. Maybe you or I would not tape a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX>, or maybe we think that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tripp</ENAMEX>'s friendship is not what we would call friendship, but her motives in
making the tapes are irrelevant to the charges against the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>. While I
have been a staunch <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> supporter (and, to some extent, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defender</ENAMEX>), the fact
that we are allowing our debate over <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tripp</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> and motives to enter
into our debate over whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> perjured himself or encouraged
others to do so shows the effectiveness of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> spin <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX>.

            Please
stop worrying about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tripp</ENAMEX>'s motives--if there is a debate over this it is a
debate over the limits of friendship when confronted with (potentially)
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">criminal</ENAMEX> acts on the part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX>. This is a valid question, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tripp</ENAMEX>'s
morals per se are irrelevant. Stop wasting your editorial bandwidth and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX>' time on this.

               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Proto-Nerds</ENAMEX>
            

            In his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 11</TIMEX> piece,
"<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nerd</ENAMEX> vs.
Nebbish," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Franklin Foer</ENAMEX> presents a few alternative explanations for the
origin of the word "nerd." When I was an undergraduate at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rennselaer</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Polytechnic Institute</ENAMEX> about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30 years ago</TIMEX>, it was widely believed that "knurd"
(the pronunciation was the same) was simply "drunk" spelled backward.

            The usage was similar to
current usage: A knurd was someone who spent too much time studying and not
enough time socializing. This was in sharp contrast to the stereotypical frat
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX>, who, in a time when the word "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX>" was exclusively a noun, would
consume excessive amounts of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> as part of their recreational activities.
The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">campus archetypes</ENAMEX> were considered to be such polar opposites that the
word <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">knurd</ENAMEX> emerged. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">those days</TIMEX>, in addition to the ill-fitting
permanent-press clothes that didn't seem to work, the pocket <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">protector</ENAMEX>, and the
thick glasses held together with electrical tape, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">proto-knurd</ENAMEX> wore a slide
rule on his belt. The stereotype was so pervasive and pejorative that even at
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPI</ENAMEX>, one seldom actually saw a belt-mounted slide rule, a pocket <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">protector</ENAMEX>, or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">glasses</ENAMEX> repaired with tape.

            I have
seen evidence of this usage and spelling in old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">campus</ENAMEX> humor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazines</ENAMEX> dating
back to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the '40s and '50s</TIMEX>. I don't have any explanation for the current
spelling.

Readiness
            

            I read with interest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lawrence</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Korb</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 10</TIMEX> statement in "The 21st
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Century Military</ENAMEX>" that "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reserve</ENAMEX> ground combat <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">units</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">brigade</ENAMEX> level
and above cannot be maintained at any reasonable level of readiness on a
part-time basis because of the complexity of combined <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX>." He accurately
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> the current situation for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Reserve</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Guard</ENAMEX> combat <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">units</ENAMEX>.
He also implies that it would be impossible to maintain combat readiness in
such <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>. I believe this is wrong.

            The current <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Army Reserve</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">guard</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> typically conduct their training <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one weekend each month</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks each year</TIMEX>. For combat and combat support <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the weekend</TIMEX> training is
usually a waste of time. In my <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six years</TIMEX> as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Army Reserve</ENAMEX>
military intelligence <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">battalion</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1980s</TIMEX>, we did useful field training on
at most <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a dozen</NUMEX> of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than 60 weekend</TIMEX> drills I attended. Even on those
occasions, most of the time was spent traveling to and from the training areas.
The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks</TIMEX>' <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> training was much more useful, but even that gave us at
most a week of field training, since there were <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several days</TIMEX> of preparations
for the move to the training <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">site</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several more days</TIMEX> of equipment cleanup
after training.

            I believe that reserve and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">guard</ENAMEX> combat and combat support <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> should eliminate <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the weekend</TIMEX> drills and
instead have a single, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one month annual</TIMEX> training (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT</ENAMEX>). The benefits of this
would be to:

            Increase the number of
effective field training <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX>. This assumes that the number of
preparation and cleanup <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> could be kept the same.

            Reduce the effect of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">personnel</ENAMEX> turnover. In a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>-man <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX>, about every <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four months</TIMEX> we lost a person
(due to enlistment expiration) and gained a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>. There was no way to set up
a stable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> to build skills because we constantly had to train someone new in
the basic tasks. During AT, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> could be restructured once, at the
beginning, and then remain stable through the remaining portion of
training.

            Reduce the geographic
dependence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>. Since unit <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> must go to weekend drills <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every month</TIMEX>,
they must be close enough to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">reserve center</ENAMEX>. With a single AT, even
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> from across the state or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> could be flown out and back once a
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">reserve center</ENAMEX>. (Estimated cost to fly <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400,000</NUMEX> reservists at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$500</NUMEX>
each is <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$200 million</NUMEX>. The cost could be even less if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force Reserve</ENAMEX> units
transported the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Army</ENAMEX> reservists--and not every reservist would have to be
flown. The cost would also be offset by the lower personnel costs: <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30 days</TIMEX>' pay
instead of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60 days</TIMEX>' pay the typical reservist receives <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each year</TIMEX>.)

            Please
note that I am not advocating a change to the training for combat service
support (maintenance, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX>, and logistics) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>. Many of these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> are
able to conduct meaningful training on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekend</TIMEX> drills, since their training
does not rely as heavily on being in the field.
