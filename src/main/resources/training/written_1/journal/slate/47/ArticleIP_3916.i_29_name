               A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nation</ENAMEX>
Divided
            

            In addition to reading the
inner workings of my heart as it relates to tax rates for married <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couples</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rob</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McIntyre</ENAMEX> ("E-Mail to
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Editors</ENAMEX>," <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 7</TIMEX>) takes issue with my arithmetic. While he is sadly
mistaken in the former instance--all marriage penalties are, like God's
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, equally dear to my heart--he may be right for all I know in the
latter. I do know, however, that my numbers have a source that has nothing to
do with my admittedly arthritic arithmetic skills. If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McIntyre</ENAMEX> has a problem,
he should consult the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 2, 1996</TIMEX>, "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Taxing Issues"</ENAMEX> column in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barron</ENAMEX>'s titled <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">"Marry in Haste</ENAMEX>," by the noted tax <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gelband</ENAMEX>. In other words, consider it fact checked.

            As for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrew Sullivan</ENAMEX>'s and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Katha Pollitt</ENAMEX>'s comments ("The <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Breakfast</ENAMEX>
Table"), given <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sullivan</ENAMEX>'s tenure at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNR</ENAMEX> , including but not limited
to his brilliant editing there of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Glass</ENAMEX>, I will take his comments as a
compliment. I will resist the urge to reply to my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nation</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleague</ENAMEX> Katha
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pollitt</ENAMEX>'s comments about me and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX>, whom she so
knowledgeably characterizes without ever having been introduced.

                  Slate
                is not the place to air intra- <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Nation</ENAMEX> feuds, despite
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Katha</ENAMEX>'s verbal incontinence. I find it sad, moreover, to read the same tired
tripe over and over from the pen of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> who once appeared on her way to
being a great <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poet</ENAMEX> and gave it all up to write a single column, over and over,
for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past 15 years</TIMEX>.

               Tale of
the Tape
            

            Regarding
the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 21</TIMEX> "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Today's Papers</ENAMEX>": If <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Nixon</ENAMEX>'s "but it would be wrong" is
really the classic example of what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Safire</ENAMEX> calls "tickling the wire," how do you
explain the fact that no hush money was raised or paid as a result of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">March</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1973</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Watergate-</ENAMEX>era tape to which you refer? <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">detractors</ENAMEX> say the desultory
comments about raising money were the operative (as they used to say) part of
the conversation; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defenders</ENAMEX> (of which I, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nixon</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">library</ENAMEX>, of course am one) stress that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> said it would be wrong and
that (if memory serves) "the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> can't do it." Seems that the only way
to resolve such ambiguity is to see what actually happened as a result of the
taped conversation. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ditto</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> imagines, with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hubbell</ENAMEX>.

               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affirmative Track</ENAMEX>-tion
            

            As a
former track wannabe and somebody with several postgraduate degrees, I took
exception to this egregious statement in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 21</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Today's Papers:</ENAMEX>

            Letting slower white
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">runners</ENAMEX> into races just because they're white <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> is precisely
analogous to letting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Latinos</ENAMEX> with poor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SATs</ENAMEX> and low grades into
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">colleges</ENAMEX> just because they're <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Latinos</ENAMEX>.

            There is
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> criterion on which to judge road racing: time posted. You
cannot argue about home field advantage, equipment differences, or help from
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teammates</ENAMEX>. You are arguing there is only one criterion (because it is
precisely analogous) for determining a good college <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SAT</ENAMEX> scores. In a
road race you look to see who finished <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, and in determining who is
eligible for race entry, you go by the unbiased clock.

               Viagravation
            

            I have this overwhelming need
to respond to a remark you made in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 20</TIMEX> edition of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Today's Papers</ENAMEX>. The remark was in response to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>
Post front-page story about a possible bias by insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> with
regard to payment for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Viagra</ENAMEX> vs. oral contraceptives. You state that, since the
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> paragraph "says that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than half</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Viagra</ENAMEX> prescriptions are being
subsidized by health plans, and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">sixth</NUMEX> paragraph says that slightly more
than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of all birth control pills are," there isn't really any bias, and
"why do we need this story?"

            I submit
to you that you are overlooking a key fact in this statistic and that is the
amount of time it took to get each of those plans to subsidize the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> in
question. How long have birth control pills been available by prescription? 20
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>? <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25 years</TIMEX>? Yet only slightly more than half of all birth control pills
are subsidized by health plans, according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> . By comparison,
how long has <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Viagra</ENAMEX> been available--<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a month</TIMEX>? How wonderful for impotent men
that in that short space of time, it has already reached approximately the same
level of subsidization by health plans.

               Antitrust and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Law</ENAMEX>
            

            In his piece "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Microsuits</ENAMEX>," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacob Weisberg</ENAMEX> shows he knows more about current
politics than about legal history. He states, "The question whether regulation
of commerce is a state or national affair was supposed to have been settled in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1789</TIMEX>."

            Of course, this question was
by no means "settled" with either the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Constitution</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1787</TIMEX>) or the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Bill of Rights</ENAMEX>
(<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1789</TIMEX>). As there were few <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX> large enough to cross state lines into federal
jurisdiction in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 18 th century</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founders</ENAMEX> generally
assumed the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> would govern the economy. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Nineteenth century</TIMEX> common law
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">restraint-of-trade</ENAMEX> prosecutions fell to the state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX>, as did the earliest
antitrust cases. Federal antitrust suits could not exist until <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> enacted
a federal antitrust law in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1890</TIMEX> and, even after, the question of jurisdiction
remained. Since the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Constitution</ENAMEX> only permitted the national <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> to
regulate "commerce," whole areas of economic life were outside federal
jurisdiction. This was the essence of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1905</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">E.C. Knight</ENAMEX> case, which
held manufacturing beyond the authority of federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> did not enable wholesale federal intervention by defining
"commerce" more broadly until the New Deal cases such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NLRB</ENAMEX> vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jones</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Laughlin</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1937</TIMEX>).

            Of
course, the fact that state prosecutions have a long history does not mean they
are desirable. On the other hand, on the basis of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weisberg</ENAMEX>'s article, I'm not
certain why he finds diverse legal climates so disturbing. Are we to discount
such antitrust prosecutions because the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys general</ENAMEX> are ambitious? This
seems a mighty high standard for any policy. Though it may be inefficient, I
think it reasonable that each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locality</ENAMEX> can set the legal conditions of its own
economic life, as <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> do with regard to taxation, infrastructure,
and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a thousand</NUMEX> other economic issues.
