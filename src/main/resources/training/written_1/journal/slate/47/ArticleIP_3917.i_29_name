            I'm glad to see you finally
printed something about the nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX> race in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Asia</ENAMEX> ("<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Week/The Spin"</ENAMEX>). I'm
not sure why you waited <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a week</TIMEX>. So much for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Web</ENAMEX>'s unique potential for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">timeliness</ENAMEX>.

            How
typical that the piece was not something more educational. You could have given
us a piece on the roots of the conflict, a discussion of how previous wars
between the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> got started, a discussion of how the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> supported
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslims</ENAMEX>, etc. It's clearly more important to you that your <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> never
be considered outside the spin than that your <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> be informative. By
pursuing spin over context, you join much of the rest of the print media in
reducing itself to the level of TV talk shows like <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Crossfire</ENAMEX> . But in the
case of 
                  Slate
               , we not only get no greater context than we'd get
from television--we actually get it in a less timely fashion. This is
especially foolish considering the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Web</ENAMEX>'s capacity for instantaneous
dissemination of information.

               The
Dividend of the World as We Know It
            

            Please
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inform Clive Crook</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">"Dialogue: The Stock Market"</ENAMEX>) that dividends are not the only
"payouts" to be considered when valuing a stock. An <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> can receive
payouts beyond dividends by ... selling the stock. No valuation formula for
stocks uses dividends for the future cash flows. That is not because everyone
"implicitly assumes" <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> pay out all their earnings. It is because
everyone assumes that the value of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>, and hence the stock price,
rises with earnings and that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> can capture this increase in value by
selling. Crook mentions "capital appreciation," saying that his method will
reflect it because "dividends are themselves growing along with the worth of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>." But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> take any number of different approaches to
dividends, and their relationship to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>'s worth is very inconsistent.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intel</ENAMEX>, for example, pays a token <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">12 cents</NUMEX> a share. Imagine a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> that paid
no dividends but had <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1 billion</NUMEX> in earnings and expected growth of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 percent</NUMEX> a
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>. Would its stock be worthless? Of course not. This is all elementary, the
financial equivalent of saying that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> plus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> equals <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>.

            In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">David</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plotz</ENAMEX>'s "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Assessment</ENAMEX>" of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hunter S. Thompson</ENAMEX>, he superciliously states:
"There's something unbearably sad about a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who still takes
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>." Would it be as unbearably sad if he drank espresso or enjoyed a good
bottle of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX>? The worst part of the war on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> is its hypocrisy. I was
surprised to find it in 
                  Slate
               .
