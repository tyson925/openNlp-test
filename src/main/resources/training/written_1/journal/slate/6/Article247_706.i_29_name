            Everybody leads with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX>'s widely anticipated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> interest
rate cut. The headlines at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA Today</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>
Times and the New York
Times indicate that the move was taken to protect the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> economy from
the global troubles. The headline over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> front-pager on the cut doesn't say why
it was made but the story immediately mentions concerns about how weaknesses in
foreign economies might affect our own. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> headline says the move was meant to help
("quiet") overseas markets.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> dropped the fed funds rate--what <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX> charge each other for
overnight loans--from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.5 percent</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.25 percent</NUMEX>--but, contrary to some
expectations, left the discount rate it charges <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX> for loans at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 percent</NUMEX>.
Although all the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX> have, as usual, no problem finding some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> to
foresee up trends on rates and some to foresee down ones, their lines on the
interest rate future shake out this way: the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> suggests in its <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX>
paragraph further rate reductions of up to a full percentage point;
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAT</ENAMEX> , in its <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">sixth</NUMEX> paragraph, quotes an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> saying there's no
indication of another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> move anytime soon; in its <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">sixth</NUMEX> paragraph, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> says the narrow language of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> announcement strongly indicates
this also. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> holds off its initial rate forecast until the
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">twenty-third</NUMEX> paragraph, a comment that many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> think further reductions
are likely. All the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX> except the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WSJ</ENAMEX> tend to suggest that rates are
driven by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> policy. Characteristically, the ever-market-oriented
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal</ENAMEX> stresses that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>'s action had already been anticipated by
long-term bonds with yields at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty-year</TIMEX> lows.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> off-lead is a strongly reported effort towards a scary
conclusion: the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iraqis</ENAMEX> are surprisingly close to having A-bombs.
(Surely this should have been the lead story!) According to the story, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UN</ENAMEX> arms
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inspectors</ENAMEX> reported <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">twice</NUMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX>--in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>--that they
had credible intelligence indicating that while still lacking the fissile fuel
for such bombs, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iraqis</ENAMEX> had built and maintained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three or four</NUMEX> implosion
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">devices</ENAMEX>. If fueled, says the paper, they'd each be A-bombs larger than the one
dropped at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hiroshima</ENAMEX>. These charges were first made by former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UN</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inspector</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scott Ritter</ENAMEX> but when he made them they were assessed by senior <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">policy-makers</ENAMEX> as not credible. However, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> says, new evidence emerging
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</TIMEX> has convinced the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> most responsible for such
assessments. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> says the information was obtained from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iraqi</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">defectors</ENAMEX>. It includes such details as that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iraqis</ENAMEX> used a fleet of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">distinctively</ENAMEX> marked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mercedes</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trucks</ENAMEX> to shuttle the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bomb</ENAMEX> frames among hiding
places. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ritter</ENAMEX> says that one defector sketched a map depicting <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> of these
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">depots</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U-2</ENAMEX> spy <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planes</ENAMEX> found <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> of them.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> carry front-page obits on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Bradley</ENAMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mayor</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>, (the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX>
points out high up that he was the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mayor</ENAMEX> of a major <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> and of a
largely white one) who died <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 80</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sharecroppers</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandson</ENAMEX> of slaves, was <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mayor</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1973 to 1993</TIMEX>. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">LAT</ENAMEX> cites as his principal accomplishments, a downtown <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> boom,
the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1984</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Olympics</ENAMEX> success, creating coalitions between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> and
labor and management, with an accompanying racial peace lasting most of his
tenure, and establishing civilian control over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAPD</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> also notes
the personal financial scandals and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rodney King</ENAMEX>-inspired riots of his last
term in office.

            On a relatively <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Monica</ENAMEX>-free news day, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> op-ed page, in clear
contrast to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> editorial page, is still working hard to keep
scandal pressure off <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Clinton</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX>'s palaver palette offers <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Rich</ENAMEX>
excoriating <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beltway</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pundits</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gene McCarthy</ENAMEX> arguing that special <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecutors</ENAMEX> are
inherently anti-democratic, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maureen Dowd</ENAMEX> mitigating the presidential prurience
with a sexual ineptness defense and an <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alabama</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX>'s discussing what a
nice scandal break <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX> down his way got by being clobbered by <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Hurricane</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Georges</ENAMEX>.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> reports that starting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX>, all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">airlines</ENAMEX> are required to
ask any <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizen</ENAMEX> traveling to or from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> something they've
not routinely asked before--the name of their next of kin. Why? Well, in case of what the paper notes
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Icelandair</ENAMEX> calls a "disruption of our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">service</ENAMEX>."
