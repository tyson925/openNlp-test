            <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">USAT</ENAMEX> leads with the movement of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> naval <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> towards the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Persian Gulf</ENAMEX>,
apparently positioning for a strike against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX>, a story that is
played on the WP front above the fold, but inside at the other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">majors</ENAMEX>. The LAT
leads with a report that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX> state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys general</ENAMEX> are very close to a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$200</NUMEX>
billion settlement of the health cost claims they've raised against the major
cigarette <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturers</ENAMEX>, a story that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WSJ</ENAMEX> flags in its front-page news box.
(The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal</ENAMEX> says the deal could end up involving <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>.) The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX>
leads with an exclusive: that during the recent <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Wye</ENAMEX> negotiations, the director
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> vowed to quit if convicted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spy</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jonathan Pollard</ENAMEX> was freed as part of
any deal reached between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palestinian Authority</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX>.

            According to the USAT account, some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> scenario is quite
familiar: A dire threat to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam</ENAMEX> (this time issued by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cohen</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> conferring with national security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> and several
foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX>, and talk of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tomahawk</ENAMEX> cruise <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missiles</ENAMEX> as the likely <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapon</ENAMEX>.
But, notes the paper, there is a new wrinkle too: the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX> has
ruled out any last-ditch negotiations. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> doesn't mention another one:
unlike past stare-downs, this time neither <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">France</ENAMEX> nor <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> is openly
resisting <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> military action.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> lead explains that the proposed tobacco settlement doesn't
provide as much regulatory restraint nor as much money as the failed federal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tobacco</ENAMEX> bill would have, but also offers the industry less protection from
other lawsuits. In return for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">billions</NUMEX> and a ban on cigarette billboards,
transit ads, and logoed merchandise. the bill would end most suits seeking
recovery of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicaid</ENAMEX> funds spent by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">smokers</ENAMEX>. The deal would, says
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>, even provide money for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tobacco</ENAMEX>-friendly <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kentucky</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Carolina</ENAMEX> that haven't filed such suits. The settlement might be announced
as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early as next Monday</TIMEX>.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> lead says that before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Tenet</ENAMEX> took his
stand regarding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pollard</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> was seriously considering releasing
him. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> adds that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tenet</ENAMEX>'s vehemence was a direct reflection of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intelligence</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX>'s depth of anger towards <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pollard</ENAMEX> despite his conviction
for spying for a friendly power. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> notes that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pollard</ENAMEX> stole more
top-secret documents than almost any other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spy</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> history (it would
have been nice if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> had said who had taken more), a take
measurable in <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">cubic yards</NUMEX>, plus it is still unknown if any of them ended up in
unfriendly hands.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> lead is a peek at the special alternative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX> issue of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JAMA</ENAMEX> that's being published <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> such issue by a mainstream medical
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">journal</ENAMEX>. According to the story, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an estimated 83 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> used
some sort of alternative medical treatment <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX>, up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">47 percent</NUMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX>.
This mainly reflects the medical habits of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby boomers</ENAMEX>, most of whom said they
pursued the alternative therapies more to prevent future problems than to treat
current ones. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> spent <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$27 billion</NUMEX> on alternative
treatment <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX>, most of it not reimbursed by insurance. What seems to
work: A traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> therapy, moxibustion, which involves burning an
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">herb</ENAMEX> next to the big toe, proved safe and effective for stimulating fetal
movement to avoid breech deliveries; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yoga</ENAMEX>-style stretching helps combat carpal
<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tunnel syndrome</ENAMEX>; and traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> herbs alleviate irritable bowel
<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">syndrome</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ineffective</ENAMEX>: chiropractic spinal manipulations did not seem to help
with tension headaches; and acupuncture didn't do any better than placebos in
the treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AIDS-related</ENAMEX> nerve damage. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">USAT</ENAMEX> covers pretty much the
same ground in its front-page "cover story," although adding that insurance
coverage of non-mainstream treatment is on the rise.

            A front-page WSJ feature on the current upsurge in home buying notes
a troublesome undercurrent. Yes, the increase in low-down-payment home loans
has meant opening up home ownership to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more</NUMEX> low-income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> and to more
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanics</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX>. However, this new class of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homeowner</ENAMEX>, being more
financially strapped, might have a much harder time retaining <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> through any
significant downturn.

            A front-page <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> piece identifies the real lesson corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>
is taking away from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> trial: old e-mail can be a minefield of legal
liability. High-tech <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX>, long based on the free-flow and candor that e-mail
encourages, are having second thoughts. For instance, with an eye towards the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> are now encouraged, says the paper, to say "fair competition"
not "slaughtering" when talking of business strategy. And to dump old e-mail
whenever possible. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> reports that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amazon.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX> recently offered
free lattes to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> who quickly expelled from their e-mail all files not
required for ongoing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX> or by law.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> reports that the recent DNA test revelation that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thomas</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jefferson</ENAMEX> almost certainly fathered a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> with one of his slaves has
energized an <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Illinois</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>'s previous claim that it is descended from a
liaison between a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">George Washington</ENAMEX> and one of his slaves. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> is
now searching for known <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">descendants</ENAMEX> for the same sort of genetic
testing used in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jefferson</ENAMEX> matter. The story doesn't say whether the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Illinois</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family members</ENAMEX> view themselves as white or black. But if you think
about it, if this sort of testing became a trend it would be a good thing no
matter what the apparent race of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">testers</ENAMEX>. If they are black, discovering a
relationship to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Founding Father</ENAMEX> would tend to replace feelings of alienation
often felt by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minorities</ENAMEX> with feelings of proud connection. If they are white,
discovering a blood relationship to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">slave</ENAMEX> would tend to stimulate empathy for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX>. Either way, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">society</ENAMEX> wins.
