            Everybody leads with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth Starr</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> call and give up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about half</NUMEX> of
the rest of their fronts to various aspects of the quote news unquote.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Yesterday</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX> told you what he would say. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> they tell you what he
did say. They don't tell you it's the same thing.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAT</ENAMEX> calls <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX>'s proceeding "<ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">marathon</ENAMEX>, heavily partisan" and says
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX> "generally kept his cool" as he personally made his brief against
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> sees in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end</TIMEX>-of-the-day exchanges between <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s personal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Kendall</ENAMEX> "a dramatic prime-time showdown
of legal heavyweights." The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> notes instead that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX> seemed more
professorial than prosecutorial.

            As <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAT</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> note, there was little discussion
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX>'s conclusions, the emphasis falling instead on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX>'s motives and
conduct--the main issues there being whether or not <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX> had an antecedent
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bias</ENAMEX> against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Clinton</ENAMEX>, had inappropriate connections to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paula Jones</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">defense</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX>, whether he had unlawfully detained <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monica Lewinsky</ENAMEX> and/or
violated her right to an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> and indeed, whether he had lied about his
treatment of her in a press release. There was also some discussion of whether
or not <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX> illegally leaked to the press. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> alone highlights <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX>'s
sole <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concession</ENAMEX> in the face of all this: that perhaps when requesting from
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Janet Reno</ENAMEX> expansion of his charge into <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jones</ENAMEX>-related matters, he should have
informed her of the discussions he'd previously had with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jones</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX>.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> notes that in contrast to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">453</NUMEX>-page report <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX> served up
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX>'s discussions were distinctly "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G-</ENAMEX>rated." The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX>
even quantifies the point, noting that in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX>'s opening remarks, he used
"sex" or "sexual" just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> times, compared to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 60</NUMEX> references to
"truth" or "lying." Everybody prints one of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX>'s few carnal references:
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democratic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Conyers</ENAMEX>' characterization of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX> as a "federally paid
sex <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">policeman</ENAMEX>."

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WSJ</ENAMEX> reports that on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Judiciary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX> got their
hands on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Accounting Office</ENAMEX> figures on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ken Starr</ENAMEX>'s office expenditures,
which, a congressional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> is quoted as saying, are potentially
embarrassing, in that they detail payments for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultants</ENAMEX> and outside
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> says that to keep the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dems</ENAMEX> from using the material
during the hearings <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Hyde</ENAMEX> declared it confidential.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> say <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX> testified <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> could, after
leaving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>, be prosecuted for perjury. But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> and USAT
say <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX> didn't answer the question. According to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAT</ENAMEX> poll,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX> give <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX> positive reviews, but also want their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> to
vote against impeachment.

            Meanwhile, for real <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX> spontaneity, you had to be in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> with the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>, where, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX> all report, during a "town meeting," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Clinton</ENAMEX>
was asked by an <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Osaka</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">housewife</ENAMEX> how he apologized to his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> for
his affair. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> replied that he did so "in a direct and straightforward
manner." The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> expected such a question on the trip,
primarily dedicated to economic issues. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> says the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> did
not count on the scandal coming up, because of the "<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>'s famous
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reserve</ENAMEX>."

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WSJ</ENAMEX> runs a useful feature describing what signs to look for to
tell if the global economic crisis is coming to a close. The list includes:
When the financial markets yawn in the face of bad news, when yields on
emerging market bonds go down, when inflation jitters return, when commodity
prices rise, when emerging <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nations</ENAMEX> start importing more, and when <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">economy</ENAMEX> starts to expand again. On the other hand, a sign of how much money is
washing around this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> is on full display in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAT</ENAMEX> 's front-pager on
expensive toys. It seems that nowadays you don't have to go to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAO Schwarz</ENAMEX> to
sink serious money into silly stuff. According to the paper, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8 percent</NUMEX> of the
items at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toys R Us</ENAMEX> go for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$100</NUMEX> or more, as do <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> of the fifteen top-selling
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">toys</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX>. Essentials like <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Kawasaki Ninja Power Wheels</ENAMEX> and My <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Interactive</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pooh</ENAMEX>.

            The fronts at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> all feature stories
about alarming new research (to be published <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Medical</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal</ENAMEX> ) about the death toll in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> from smoking. Right now, it seems
cigarettes kill <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">700,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> per year, most of them <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> in their middle
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>. Unless the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>'s habits change, this rate is forecast to multiply
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fourfold</ENAMEX> within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fifty years</TIMEX>.

            It's not exactly perjury, but the LAT observes that during
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX>'s proceedings, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ken Starr</ENAMEX> sat at the witness table on top of a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">briefcase</ENAMEX>, "which made him appear taller."
