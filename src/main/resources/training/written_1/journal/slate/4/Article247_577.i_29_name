            The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Whitewater</ENAMEX> indictment of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Susan McDougal</ENAMEX> leads at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA Today</ENAMEX> and
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> . The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Unabomber</ENAMEX> life-plus sentence
imposed on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Theodore Kacszynski</ENAMEX> leads at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Angeles Times</ENAMEX> . While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McDougal</ENAMEX> is still front-page where it doesn't
lead, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unabomber</ENAMEX> doesn't make the front at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> .

            McDougal was indicted for criminal contempt and obstruction by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arkansas</ENAMEX>
Whitewater <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">grand jury</ENAMEX> for refusing to answer questions posed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ken Starr</ENAMEX>.
Having already completed an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18-month</TIMEX> civil contempt sentence for refusing to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">answer Starr</ENAMEX>'s questions and now serving time for her <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whitewater</ENAMEX> fraud
conviction, she could get <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten years</TIMEX> if convicted on these new charges. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> says the move is an escalation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX>'s investigation. USAT
says it's his final effort to force <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McDougal</ENAMEX> to cooperate.

            The indictment contains some new information. At <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> point in the grand jury
room, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McDougal</ENAMEX> said, "Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX> should resign. That's my only answer to you."
And the evidence she was questioned about there but did not explain includes a
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$5,081.82</NUMEX> check she made out in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1983</TIMEX> bearing the notation, "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Payoff Clinton</ENAMEX>."
(The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> carries substantial excerpts from one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McDougal</ENAMEX>'s grand jury
appearances.)

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> quotes some legal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> saying it's highly unusual to
prosecute someone for criminal contempt who has already served a civil sentence
for the same refusal to testify. (Small but important point: the USAT
story never mentions that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McDougal</ENAMEX> was granted immunity. But this is precisely
what makes her silence indictable. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> get this right.)

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unabomber</ENAMEX> sentencing proceedings included a statement from him as well
as remarks by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">survivors</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kacszynski</ENAMEX>
was "unrepentant" and "steely-eyed," and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> "anguished." A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">widow</ENAMEX>'s
suggestion to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> makes everybody's story: "Lock him so far down that
when he dies, he'll be closer to hell."

            If you're wondering what sort of service to look out for when NationsBank
completes its recently announced <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$60 billion</NUMEX> merger with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BankAmerica</ENAMEX> to become
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX>, take a gander at the WP front, which reports
that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">NationsBank</ENAMEX>, without admitting guilt (or denying any wrongdoing), agreed to pay <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$6.75 million</NUMEX> in fines to settle charges it sold
high-risk investment funds as safe banking products, mostly to elderly
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> who suffered significant losses. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> at the bank
also received fines from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$35,000 to $100,000</NUMEX>. The story doesn't say, but
"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Today's Papers</ENAMEX>" guesses these fines don't represent as much of a dent to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bankers</ENAMEX> as the uninsured losses did to the elderly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX>. After all, they
only amount to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX>-thousandth of the value of the merged <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>.

            The WP front reports that on the strength of news stories about tiny
biotech <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EntreMed's</ENAMEX> promising <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>'s stock price
quadrupled <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX>. In an inside piece, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> details this
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX> and a concomitant rise in the hope market as well.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> reports that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about only about 5%</NUMEX> of the
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five million</NUMEX> workplace drug tests administered <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lab</ENAMEX> came
out positive. That's down from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.8 %</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year before</TIMEX> and from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">18.1 %</NUMEX> in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</TIMEX>.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> reports that a black <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marine</ENAMEX> was severely beaten in broad daylight in a busy
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moscow</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">band</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">skinheads</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Skinhead</ENAMEX> assaults have become such
a problem, reports the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> , that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Embassy</ENAMEX> has twice
alerted <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX>, particularly those of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asian</ENAMEX> origin about the
danger of unprovoked attacks. Other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">embassies</ENAMEX> have done the same. Foreign
student <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> complain that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> cops routinely fail to protect them. The
story is carried inside, as it was in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX>, and the
question is, why? If a white <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">embassy guard</ENAMEX> was viciously assaulted by
black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">thugs</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>, "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Today's Papers</ENAMEX>" thinks it would be a page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> story
everywhere, in this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> and beyond.
