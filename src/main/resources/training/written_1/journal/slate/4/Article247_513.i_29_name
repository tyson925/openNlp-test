               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> leads with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>' rare execution of a female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prisoner</ENAMEX>. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> lead is the surprise return to this
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> and arrest of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinton</ENAMEX> fund-raising figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charlie Trie</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>
Times lead is the latest account of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> efforts to line up <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">allies</ENAMEX>'
support for a military <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX> against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX>, while the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX>
lead covers the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOD</ENAMEX>'s broad description to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> of what such an operation
might entail.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAT</ENAMEX> 's description of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karla Faye Tucker</ENAMEX> sums up the emotionally
charged context perfectly: "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pickax</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">killer</ENAMEX> and born-again <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX>." All the
papers quote <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tucker</ENAMEX>'s last words to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> of her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX>: "I am so
sorry. I hope God will give you peace with this." The papers point out that the
death by lethal injection came despite pleas for mercy from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pope</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pat</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robertson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesse Jackson</ENAMEX>.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> runs a sidebar on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mechanics</ENAMEX> of lethal injection. Good detail, but still no answer to
the perennial question: Do they swab the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prisoner</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> to prevent
infection before giving the needle or not? (If so, why?) But the piece does
report that by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX> reckoning, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">287</NUMEX> lethal injection executions
performed since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1982</TIMEX> have been botched. Like the time in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX> when a
tube leading into the condemned <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> burst, spewing lethal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fluids</ENAMEX> towards
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witnesses</ENAMEX>.

            Both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> front-page <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tucker</ENAMEX> pieces capture the scene
outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prison</ENAMEX> walls. The WP notices some sympathetic signs but also
one stating, "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Forget Injection, Use a Pickax</ENAMEX>." Both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX> note that a cheer
went up from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX> when the deed was done.

            Although all the coverage describes the last-minute legal maneuvering, no
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> explains how it was that this open-and-shut case took fifteen years
to resolve.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> lead describes how <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trie</ENAMEX> returned from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX> to
Dulles <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX> where he surrendered to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>. He now faces a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fifteen</NUMEX>-count
indictment--handed down just <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX>--alleging the funneling of illegal
campaign funds to the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> ticket. According to his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trie</ENAMEX>'s
return was voluntary, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> says no final understanding has been
reached about whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trie</ENAMEX> will cooperate with the investigation.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madeleine Albright</ENAMEX> wrapped up her whirlwind tour of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mideast</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> without winning a united mandate from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> allies to launch
what could well be the most punishing military strike against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Desert</ENAMEX>
Storm. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> says the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> did, however, did win recognition from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> allies
ranging from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hussein</ENAMEX> is behaving illegally and that
he must provide <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inspectors</ENAMEX> with unfettered, unconditional access to all sites.
And <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albright</ENAMEX> sees approval for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> to do what it feels is necessary, even
if other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> may sit out the action. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> inside piece says that
none of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albright</ENAMEX> consulted with expressed outright
opposition to the use of force versus <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX>, and that several were considerably
more supportive in private.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> lead sees "war fever" gripping <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> as it's
told by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Cohen</ENAMEX> that if diplomacy fails, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> will wage a
"significant" military campaign against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX>, which turns out to mean a
sustained air war, but no substantial number of ground <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX>. According to the
paper, this is commensurate with congressional thinking, which has little room
for reprising the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Gulf War</ENAMEX>. On the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hill</ENAMEX> they have the stomach to contain
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam</ENAMEX>, not to remove him.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> also reports that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> feels it already
has in hand the justification for any new military strikes: the Congressional
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resolution</ENAMEX> supporting hitting <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> passed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX> on the eve of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gulf</ENAMEX>
War.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> runs a front-page feature showing the
latest corporate thinking on office <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">romances</ENAMEX>. The piece points out that up to
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">just a few years ago</TIMEX>, at most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies office</ENAMEX> relationships were grounds for
dismissal, with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">junior member</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> typically getting the axe, but
that nowadays, such <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corning</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xerox</ENAMEX> have moved to
the view that such relationships cannot be banned but can be managed. Usually
by ensuring that neither romantic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> is in the other's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">command</ENAMEX>.
Such thinking has no doubt fostered an environment in which, reports the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> married to each other.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAT</ENAMEX> reports that while <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monica</ENAMEX> is in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brentwood</ENAMEX> visiting her father
(just down the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>, apparently, from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O.J.</ENAMEX>'s old spread), her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> are
still negotiating with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ken Starr</ENAMEX>.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Rich</ENAMEX> reminds us that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX> scandal isn't about
the independent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counsel</ENAMEX> law or media ethics. It's about sex. After all, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rich</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">observes</ENAMEX>, even though <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">75 percent</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> tells <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pollsters</ENAMEX> there's too much
coverage of the scandal, that same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> has made the porn business twice as
big as major-league <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">baseball</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times the size of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Disney World</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX>
times bigger than <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Broadway</ENAMEX>.
