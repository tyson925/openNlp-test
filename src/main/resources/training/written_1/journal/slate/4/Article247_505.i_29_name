            "This is going to be the biggest story in my lifetime," is the way James
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carville</ENAMEX> put it, and it leads everywhere, eclipsing such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX>-any-other-day
as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pope</ENAMEX> celebrating <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mass</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX>, a surprise guilty plea in the Unabomber
case, and the decision by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> to give in on the issue of Windows
95/Internet <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Explorer</ENAMEX> separation.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>
Today says that while papering <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> and elsewhere with subpoenas,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth Starr</ENAMEX> was working to persuade <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monica Lewinsky</ENAMEX> to testify against
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> says that the indefinite postponement of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX>'s deposition--originally scheduled for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>--in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paula Jones</ENAMEX> case
was sought by her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> while he negotiates with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX>. By contrast, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> says there appears to be little
movement towards a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX> deal that would protect her from prosecution
for perjury and obstruction of justice, adding that her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> says he hasn't
heard from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX>. "Obviously," the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> quotes him, "if
there's jeopardy [to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX>], I'd like a deal."

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX>
coverage emphasizes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX>'s statement by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vernon</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jordan</ENAMEX> that "absolutely and unequivocally" <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX> told <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jordan</ENAMEX> that there was
no affair. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jordan</ENAMEX> vigorously denied telling her to lie. Everybody also reports
that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jordan</ENAMEX> admitted he'd arranged some job interviews for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Readers</ENAMEX>,
especially those just out of college with hardly any prior work experience, are
encouraged to contact Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jordan</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> for similar job placement
assistance.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> still leads the way in monomaniacal <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Monica</ENAMEX>-mania. Besides the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">full</TIMEX> front-page treatment, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> strews inside such items as a report
on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Gore</ENAMEX>'s first statement about the scandal (he believes his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boss</ENAMEX>), a
check-in with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gennifer Flowers</ENAMEX>, and a primer for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> now
suddenly ask, "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Mommy, Daddy</ENAMEX>, what is adultery?"

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> says the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> appears to have settled on a "strategy
of denial and delay," which includes attempting to undermine <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX>'s
credibility and raising questions about her motivation. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> reports
tension inside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> between political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisors</ENAMEX>, who feel it's
imperative for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> to quickly and forcefully rebut allegations, and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX>, who warn that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> should keep his public comments terse and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">undetailed</ENAMEX> until they can assemble more facts. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> describes
meetings held <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> as marked by heated debate. The
paper reports one explanation offered by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinton</ENAMEX> staff that shows the
meeting rooms need better ventilation: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s comments during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1992</TIMEX>
campaign could be squared with his apparent admission during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last Saturday</TIMEX>'s
deposition that he'd had an affair with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gennifer Flowers</ENAMEX> because "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> was
only denying the precise descriptions of the affair that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Flowers</ENAMEX> had publicly
alleged--not that any sex between them had occurred."

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> , in an editorial slugged "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Tell the Full Story</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">President</ENAMEX>," says that
the statements offered thus far by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jordan</ENAMEX> have compounded the
case's oddities, not dissipated them.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAT</ENAMEX> reports that those <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX> subpoenaed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> include not just
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jordan</ENAMEX> but also the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">widow</ENAMEX> of former <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arlington</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">National Cemetery</ENAMEX> resident <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lawrence</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> says the point of that is to ask her if she had an
affair with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>. Others the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">dailies</ENAMEX> list among the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX>-struck include
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s personal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX> and a former <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miss America</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> reports
that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> visited <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Linda Tripp</ENAMEX>'s literary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lucianne Goldberg</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">York</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAT</ENAMEX> has the detail that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">in 1972 Goldberg</ENAMEX> was paid <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1,000</NUMEX> a
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week</TIMEX> by a high-level <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX> operative to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spy</ENAMEX> on the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McGovern</ENAMEX> campaign.

            Amidst all this, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Lord</ENAMEX> and his hair died. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">obits</ENAMEX> fail to clear up an
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">abiding</ENAMEX> mystery: Why did <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kam Fong</ENAMEX> play "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chin Ho"</ENAMEX>? Why couldn't he just be "Kam
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fong</ENAMEX>"?
