               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>
Today , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX>
each lead with a federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX>'s rejection of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monica Lewinsky</ENAMEX>'s claim that she
had an immunity deal with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ken Starr</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>
Times leads with the results of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> study of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">French</ENAMEX>
abortion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pill RU-486</ENAMEX>: highly effective and safe for terminating early
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pregnancies</ENAMEX>, a story that doesn't make the other front pages (the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX>
national edition carries it on p. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>).

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> had been arguing that a letter from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX> granted her
immunity. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX>'s dismissal of that contention, writes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAT</ENAMEX> , may set
the stage for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX> to force <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX> to "appear" before a federal grand jury.
This is a little confusing since actually, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX> would have had more leverage
to force <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX> to testify (rather than just show up) if she had
immunity from prosecution. (The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> get this point right.)
But in any case, one of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Ginsburg</ENAMEX>, is quoted by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAT</ENAMEX> as saying his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">client</ENAMEX> "will never testify before a grand jury
without immunity." And the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> reports that her other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX>, Nathaniel
Speights, "ridiculed" the idea that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX> would indict his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client</ENAMEX>. "No one," he
is quoted as saying, "is going to stand for somebody being indicted for having
a sexual relationship with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>." (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Today</ENAMEX>'s reports in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> to the effect that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary Clinton</ENAMEX> used the marital
confidentiality privilege to avoid answering some <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX> questions means that
she may be somebody who is not being indicted because she's having a
sexual relationship with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>.)

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX>'s ruling is still under seal. USAT credits the story to an
unnamed "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> with knowledge of the decision." The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> cites
"<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> familiar with the case." The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> refers to "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> close
to either side of the investigation." Wonder why the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> semi-outed its
own <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>, saying they are "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX>," which leaves them quite vulnerable to
punishment by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX>, who warned the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> in the case against disclosing
her sealed rulings.

            The LAT front and the insides of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> report that a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">consortium of Blue Cross</ENAMEX> health plans in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> (why does the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WSJ</ENAMEX> in
its story use the odd locution "<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 35</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>"?) filed lawsuits against
the tobacco industry, seeking <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">billions</NUMEX> in damages to compensate for the expense
of treating smoking-related illnesses. The lawsuits, modeled on those
successfully brought by several state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX>, constitute,
in the words of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> , a "major new assault" in what is already
history's costliest collection of cases. A similar ratcheting up is afoot in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> wars, with, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> front reports, thirteen states
planning a joint antitrust action, separate from the pending federal case
against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>, to block the release of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Windows</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">98</NUMEX>.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> has a front-page exclusive detailing a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> in the annals of
crime: a cyber murder confession. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 22</TIMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> screen-named <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">"Larry</ENAMEX>"
made a posting to an on-line <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alcoholics</ENAMEX> support <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> in which he described how
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three years ago</TIMEX> he murdered his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX>. The on-line chat that
followed included postings comforting the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> by telling him that the crime was
long past, but <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> participating went to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX>, and a few
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days later</TIMEX>, in a phone call to police in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Dakota</ENAMEX>, where the crime
occurred, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry Froistad</ENAMEX> confessed again.

            As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Safire</ENAMEX> did <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier in the week</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> lead editorial has
harsh words for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX>'s investigation into the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinton</ENAMEX>
re-election effort's possible illegal use of campaign funds. The editorial,
titled "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Janet Reno</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Latest Trick</ENAMEX>," says the departure of the lead <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecutor</ENAMEX>
after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">only seven months</TIMEX> makes it "plain that his appointment was a
public-relations masquerade." <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reno</ENAMEX> had to approve his transfer to a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Attorney</ENAMEX>'s job in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego</ENAMEX> and so has, says the paper, once again
"snookered...<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> who wanted a full investigation of the most corrupt
campaign fund-raising <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX> since <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Watergate</ENAMEX>."

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">T.R. Reid</ENAMEX> tells of the latest <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O.J.</ENAMEX> outrages. It seems that when a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BBC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX>
knocked on his door recently, he came out pretending to stab her several times
with a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">banana</ENAMEX>. In the subsequent interview with her, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simpson</ENAMEX> said that gorgeous
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> are constantly throwing themselves at him. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simpson</ENAMEX> spotted an <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">L.A.</ENAMEX>
District <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Attorney</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> while riding around in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BBC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">van</ENAMEX>, he responded
the same way any other innocent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizen</ENAMEX> would: he leaned out of the window and
shouted "an anatomical obscenity" at her. (By the way, why the code phrase? If
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> can--unlike the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> --let its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> know when a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">congressman</ENAMEX> thinks the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> is a "scumbag," then surely it can come dirty
on this little bit of verbiage.)
