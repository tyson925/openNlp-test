            A high-fatality, high-injury train wreck in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> leads at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA Today</ENAMEX> and
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York</ENAMEX>
Times --and pictures of it are on everybody's front. The looming
post-primary fight to reinstate public school bilingual education in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>
leads at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los Angeles Times</ENAMEX> . The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> goes with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>'s decision to
lower what counts as obesity, thereby instantly <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">classifying millions</NUMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">overweight</ENAMEX>. They won't be able to become thin again by leaving the
country either: the new rules are more in line with those wielded elsewhere.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> notes that one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> of the move is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C. Everett Koop</ENAMEX>,
who worries that it will discourage <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> from trying to lose weight.

            There's a lot in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX> about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> primaries. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">LAT</ENAMEX> lead reports that in the wake of the passage of Prop.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">227</NUMEX>, which ends bilingual education for most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one year</TIMEX>, eight
school <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">districts</ENAMEX> applied for waivers, but that the state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school board</ENAMEX> will
probably not grant them. Meanwhile, says the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">coalition</ENAMEX> of civil
rights <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> opposing the measure has filed a federal lawsuit. And according
to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAT</ENAMEX> 's front, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">superintendent</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> says his
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX> will not comply with the new law while waiting for the lawsuit to be
resolved. Similarly, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> reports that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as many as 1,500</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L.A. teachers</ENAMEX>
say they may commit the "equivalent of educational civil disobedience" by not
teaching in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>. The story offers a quotation from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> saying just
that, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> is left mystified as to where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> came up with the
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,500</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">figure</ENAMEX>. Another curiosity: the piece delays until the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">seventh</NUMEX> paragraph
the information that recently, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">48 percent</NUMEX> of those participating in a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">L.A.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">teachers</ENAMEX> union election voted for ending bilingual instruction. Statistics
appearing elsewhere on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>'s front also make it clear that this is a more
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nuanced</ENAMEX> issue than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> generally makes it seem: <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">37 percent</NUMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Latinos</ENAMEX> voted against continued bilingualism, as did <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">57 percent</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asians</ENAMEX>.

            A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> editorial says the defeat in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> of several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">super-rich</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> "may cause multimillionaires to rethink their plans for midlife
career changes." And a front-page WP piece says this development shows
that with the economy on the rise, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">electorate</ENAMEX>'s distaste for professional
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> is on the wane

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> (which carries the WP
story) fronts all report that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> has given a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> permission to conduct
the world's first full-scale test of an anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> infection
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine</ENAMEX>. The experiment will be conducted with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,000</NUMEX> uninfected
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next four years</TIMEX>. All the pieces mention that such a study
has an inherent conflict: science says don't do anything to cloud the role of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine</ENAMEX>, while ethics says do everything. But none give the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> any idea
how this problem can be resolved, and so it's hard to see how the proposed
vaccine tests can avoid coming acropper like the recent controversial <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX>
research in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX> these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX> reported on at some length.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> continues to pass along good news for
the auto industry. The latest: sales of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> and light <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trucks</ENAMEX> were up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>
percent in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX>. Special incentive deals have been driving things, so the trend
could cool soon, but in the meantime it's producing some tremendous numbers: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">minivans</ENAMEX>, for instance, are up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60.6 percent</NUMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year ago</TIMEX>, and for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">sedans</ENAMEX>,
the surge is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">85.7 percent</NUMEX>.

            Everybody's inside carries word that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> notified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>
that he will ask for yet another year of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Most Favored Nation</ENAMEX> status for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>,
meaning that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> will continue to enjoy the tariff and trade treatment
extended to most other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> trading with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WSJ</ENAMEX> points
out that with the recent ethical and national security controversies
surrounding <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> is now spotlighting <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX>'s value as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">broker</ENAMEX> for
peace between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>.

            In a WP op-ed titled <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">"I Didn't Get Dumped</ENAMEX>," former <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Monica</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Ginsburg</ENAMEX> settles scores on his way out of town.
Decrying the insular nature of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">D.C.</ENAMEX>'s political/legal culture, he observes, "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> apparently needs a passport to get into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>." Then comes the
self-praise: "I am.a hell of a trial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX>, with an innate sense of right and
wrong and up for any fight, even with an anti-constitutional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">monster</ENAMEX>." And the
tired excoriation of the press: "To my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">detractors</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">naysayers</ENAMEX> out there,
otherwise known as "talking heads," or "kibitzers," I say, bah humbug!" And
don't forget the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bulworth</ENAMEX> reference: "My former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client</ENAMEX> is now represented
by.new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counsel</ENAMEX>, and while I will remain a spirit, not a ghost, they must go
forward and represent her as they know best how to do." All this prose does
nothing so much as convince the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ginsburg</ENAMEX> has something in
common with his former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client</ENAMEX>: he probably blew it.
