               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> leads with the tough prison sentence given to an ex-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aide</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Espy</ENAMEX> and what it might mean to the dramatis personae of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> sex
scandal. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> leads with word that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Newt Gingrich</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Judiciary Committee</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Hyde</ENAMEX> agreed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> to form a small
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group of House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> that would check to see if <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth Starr</ENAMEX>'s investigation
has accumulated evidence of an impeachable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">offense</ENAMEX>. The national edition of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX>
goes with the conclusion by a panel of educational <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> that both
old-fashioned phonics and new-fashioned "whole-language" methods are valuable
for teaching reading. The metro edition of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> leads with the
unanimous decision by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York City Board of Education</ENAMEX> to require
elementary school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> to wear uniforms. The top national story in the metro
edition is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>'s criticism of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GOP</ENAMEX> budget. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>
Times lead continues the close look the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> has been taking lately at
local and state <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prisons</ENAMEX>. On the heels of indictments of prison <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> in
connection with an inmate death at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Corcoran</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prison</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> reports that
federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> are now looking into assaults and slayings of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inmates</ENAMEX> at
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> other state <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX>.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Espy</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aide</ENAMEX> case ignored the sentencing guideline
recommendation of probation to hand down a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27-month</TIMEX> sentence for lying, and
while doing so, referred darkly to a "<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX>" <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> and others who have
suggested that lying under oath in a civil case isn't a big deal. USAT
implies the "<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX>" tag was meant to refer to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monica Lewinsky</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Angeles</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Ginsburg</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> concludes the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> wanted to
"send a message to key <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> intern scandal." The sentence
is also covered inside at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> .

            According to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> select group agreed to by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gingrich</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hyde</ENAMEX> would
include <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX> and will probably examine <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX>'s evidence at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX>'s office
to avoid the leaky consequences of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House of Representatives</ENAMEX> rule making
material in the files of any standing committee available to any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX>.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> reports that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> used sharply partisan language
in knocking the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> budget before a cheering,
sympathetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AFL-CIO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Vegas</ENAMEX>, saying it "shortchanges our
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nation</ENAMEX>'s future," by eliminating his new initiatives on education, job training
and child care. Meanwhile, back in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>, reports the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> , the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate Budget Committee</ENAMEX> approved the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> tax and spending plan on a
straight party-line vote, after defeating several <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democratic</ENAMEX> attempts to
reinstate the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> initiatives. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> speech also gets front <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">space</ENAMEX> at
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> .

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> "Business Bulletin" reports that it
takes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about six years</TIMEX> for a new consumer product to take off. That probably
seems long to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX>, but, says the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal</ENAMEX> , before <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX> it
took <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about eighteen years</TIMEX>.

            A <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> executive order from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few years back</TIMEX> requires the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>
and other government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> to release every classified document in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">archives</ENAMEX> that's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than 25 years-old</TIMEX>. A WSJ front-page feature
visits the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> that's doing the declassification
work, editing out sensitive information line by line. And it's a lot of
work--there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">65 million</NUMEX> pages to review. Where's the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX>? That's a
secret .

            Right now, the press is in a big respectability-puffing, nose-holding phase
in its reporting of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> sex scandals, deploring--in exquisite
detail--having to cover all that executive branch <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">breastage</ENAMEX> and groinage. A
good clue to how insincere that all is comes in a letter to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> . "The press coverage of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Monica</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX> and her problems," a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> notes, "has mentioned little or nothing
about the [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>] intern program in which she was employed." Here at last
is a legitimate story related to the scandals that's not itself salacious--so
of course, it hasn't been done.
