            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth Starr</ENAMEX>'s latest moves lead at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA Today</ENAMEX> ,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> .
They are also the subject of a somewhat historic story at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> . The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>
Times leads with the latest developments in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> situation.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAT</ENAMEX> reports that on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX> rejected a written
testimony-for-immunity offer from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monica Lewinsky</ENAMEX>. Before a deal can be
reached, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> says, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX> wants <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX> to submit to questioning by his
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX>, who especially want to clarify whether or not there were any
attempts to cover up an affair with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX> particularly wants to
find out more about what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX> knows about the provenance of the "talking
points" memo that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Linda Tripp</ENAMEX> apparently received from her. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> lead
also says these are the main areas about which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX> wants more info.

            The LAT front doesn't cover the latest <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX> blips, but the other
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">dailies</ENAMEX> are all over the parade of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witnesses</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">D.C.</ENAMEX> grand
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jury</ENAMEX>. (The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> points out that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX>'s rejection of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX>'s offer may
reflect his confidence in what he's getting from these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witnesses</ENAMEX>.) Recent
testifiers include a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> who serves as his personal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assistant</ENAMEX>, and
the chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">steward</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bayani Nelvis</ENAMEX>.

            Last night's early editions of the on-line version of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WSJ</ENAMEX> broke the news that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nelvis</ENAMEX> told the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">grand jury</ENAMEX> he'd seen <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX> alone
together in a study adjacent to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oval Office</ENAMEX>. After the story went on-line,
it was picked up by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX> TV <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> and then denied by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nelvis</ENAMEX>'
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal</ENAMEX> also reports that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nelvis</ENAMEX> says that he told <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Secret</ENAMEX>
Service <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> that he'd found and disposed of tissues with lipstick and
other stains on them following a meeting between <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX>. The
paper says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nelvis</ENAMEX>, on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than 15 years</TIMEX>, related
this because he was personally offended.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WSJ</ENAMEX> also reports that in their grand jury appearances, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">George</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stephanopoulos</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> personal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Betty Currie</ENAMEX> confirmed that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nelvis</ENAMEX> did have the access he claimed.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal</ENAMEX> 's story represents a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> because it was released on the
paper's web site, rather than being held for the hard-copy edition, and thus
represents an occurrence you'll be seeing again: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazines</ENAMEX> using
their electronic versions to break and refine stories round-the-clock every bit
as quickly as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNN</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howard Kurtz</ENAMEX> writes that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WSJ</ENAMEX>
didn't wait for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> because it was hearing footsteps from at
least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> other news <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> lead says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX> has rejected a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>
request that the questioning of senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aides</ENAMEX> be restricted. And in
response, says the paper, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> is prepared to invoke the sweeping
protection known as executive privilege <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">as early as Thursday</TIMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">John</ENAMEX>
Podesta, a deputy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief of staff</ENAMEX>, goes before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">grand jury</ENAMEX>.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> reports that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boris Yeltsin</ENAMEX>'s warning that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> actions
against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam "</ENAMEX>could lead to a <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War</ENAMEX>" took the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> by surprise.
(This remark is also carried inside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> .) The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeltsin</ENAMEX>'s remark reflects the growing global anxiety about the
seeming inevitability of a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> attack. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Safire</ENAMEX> is less charitable,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">condemning Yeltsin</ENAMEX> harshly and painting his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreign minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Primakov</ENAMEX> as a
former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spymaster</ENAMEX> and one-time <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ally</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hussein</ENAMEX>.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> front reports that a split has emerged in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>
regarding any possible military response. Top <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> are calling for the
removal of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Saddam</ENAMEX>, while the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> is trying to suppress
expectations.

            The USAT front states that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX>'s defense <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minister</ENAMEX> is demanding
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">criminal prosecution</ENAMEX> for an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Marine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilot</ENAMEX> whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> sliced through a
ski <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">gondola</ENAMEX>'s cable <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX>, killing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all 20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> , in its
front-page coverage, says the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> was flying far lower than the rules for
training missions allow.

            With crime down and the economy up, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York City</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mayor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rudy Giuliani</ENAMEX> is
finally able to turn to the really big issues--like keeping the original <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Winnie-the-Pooh</ENAMEX> doll in a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manhattan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> against the
claims of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Parliament</ENAMEX> that it belongs back in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hizzoner</ENAMEX> is even planning a trip to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> to, in the words of a likewise
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">underworked</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokeswoman</ENAMEX>, "reassure the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bear</ENAMEX> that he is safe on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
soil."
