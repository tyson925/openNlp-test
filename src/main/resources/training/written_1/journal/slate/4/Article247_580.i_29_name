            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los Angeles Times</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>
Times lead with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX>'s vote to overhaul the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA Today</ENAMEX> runs that
as its off-lead and goes instead with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>'s order of urgent inspections and
repairs to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">152</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">older</TIMEX>-model <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">737s</ENAMEX>, a story that, of the other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">majors</ENAMEX>, only
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">the Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> puts on the front page. (The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX>
national edition runs it on p. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>, freeing up front-page space to wonder
instead about what killed the artificial turf at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giants</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stadium</ENAMEX>.) The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> move
was prompted by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Continental Airlines</ENAMEX>' discovery in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fuel</ENAMEX> leaking
into a wire-conduit going through a fuel tank, a situation, USAT
explains, not unlike that suspected of precipitating the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> Flight 800
explosion.

            Apparently, not a single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Senator</ENAMEX> believes the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> ever deals with anyone
who's not an abused <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ex-wife</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howard Baker</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> voted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">97-0</NUMEX> to put the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> under a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX> and to create new limits on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s ability to impose penalties
on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers</ENAMEX>. Like all feel-good legislation, this one will cost money--some
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senators</ENAMEX> estimated that the extra obstacles to collection would cost <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $18</NUMEX>
billion over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next decade</TIMEX>, say the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX>. But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> discussion utterly
failed to put such figures in the larger context, which is that already
the "too-powerful" "abusive" <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> is missing out on <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">at least $100 billion</NUMEX> a year
in legally owed taxes and is already auditing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than one</NUMEX> percent of
all returns. What's worse, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">dailies</ENAMEX> don't mention this either.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> reports that in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Half Moon Bay</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> a
14-year-old <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">eighth</NUMEX>-grade <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> has been the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> suspended from school
under a new state law that allows removal of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> who threaten violence.
What makes the case unusual is that what precipitated this were the two papers
he turned in for an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> class writing assignment: "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Riot</ENAMEX>," in which
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> set fire to the school <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX>, blow up the science <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">labs</ENAMEX>, and beat the
principal, and "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goin' Postal</ENAMEX>," in which a boy shoots the school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principal</ENAMEX>. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> are suing his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>'s principal and the school
district.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WSJ</ENAMEX> "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Washington Wire</ENAMEX>" reports that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Army</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">general</ENAMEX> who heads up
the 1st <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cavalry Division</ENAMEX> had this assessment for acquisition <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> of the
high-tech gear they're providing him: "You are fielding pieces of crap."

            A front-page <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> story and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> inside at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> cover a
sociological finding coming out <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Science</ENAMEX> . It's well
known that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> will under-report their questionable behavior when asked
about it by an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">interviewer</ENAMEX>, but it has long been assumed that this problem was
addressed by conducting surveys via paper and pencil questionnaires. However,
by comparing paper-and-pencil surveys to those self-administered on a computer,
the new study shows that's not true. Which means that many accepted
paper-and-pencil surveys have rendered a distorted sense of how <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> behave.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Science</ENAMEX> study, for instance, purports to show that among <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,600</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15-19-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX>, those computer-queried were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost 4</NUMEX> times more likely
than the paper-and-pencil <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> to report homosex, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.5</NUMEX> times more likely to
admit they were often or always drunk or high when having sex with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, and
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> times more likely to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cop</ENAMEX> to sex with an intravenous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX>.

            In the modern age, and especially in the modern <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX>, the pursuit of
money takes on the full aura that was, in a bygone time, reserved for the
pursuit of something else. Witness <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s WSJ front-page account of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daimler/Chrysler</ENAMEX>
merger. You have to wade pretty far down to get to "revenues," "earnings
per share," or "non-recurring income tax benefits." First you get the secret
hotel meetings, the furtive use of code names, the artful deflection of an
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">outsider</ENAMEX>'s nosy question about the relationship. There's even, according to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal</ENAMEX> , an important shower scene. And of course, there is, once the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">liaison</ENAMEX> is on the verge of consummation, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the age-old</TIMEX> question of whose name to
take. "It was a very emotional issue at the end, emotional on both sides,"
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daimler</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">CEO</ENAMEX> is quoted saying. "We both felt strongly." But then they merged.
And it was good.
