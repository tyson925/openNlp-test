               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> leads with the diplomatic efforts being undertaken to avoid <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
military action against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>
Times lead describes those efforts too, but emphasizes the nature of
the likely <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> military response. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> leads with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madeleine Albright</ENAMEX>'s frustration
with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israeli-Palestinian</ENAMEX> impasse. And the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX>
goes with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinton</ENAMEX> budget strategy.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAT</ENAMEX> reports that besides <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albright</ENAMEX>'s whirlwind tour of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Middle</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX>-related diplomacy is also being undertaken by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>.
Also, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.N.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kofi Annan</ENAMEX> has proposed loosening the strictures governing
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> sales as an incentive for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Iraqi</ENAMEX> cooperation with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.N.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inspectors</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albright</ENAMEX> said she supports that. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albright</ENAMEX> was in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuwait</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> and is bound
for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>. An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX> dispatch quoted in both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAT</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WSJ</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saudis</ENAMEX> will not allow any <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> strikes to originate from their
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAT</ENAMEX> also says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Newt Gingrich</ENAMEX> has signaled strong support for action
against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam</ENAMEX>, while his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleague</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Armey</ENAMEX> has stressed the need for
prior Congressional review of any attack plan.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> lead headline is quite clear: "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">U.S. Would Hit Iraq Hard</ENAMEX>
Despite the Likely Costs." But the text is anything but. High up, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> is
told only that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> game plan calls for taking "substantial military
action," which aims to "destroy key military props supporting <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Iraqi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX> and affirm principles for the post-<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Cold War world</ENAMEX>." Reading
further on the front page does reveal the possibility of an expanded no-fly
zone, but mainly yields the "information" that after the action, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> will
"put in place a post-strike program that would strengthen and potentially
broaden the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.N.</ENAMEX> mandate inside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX>," which the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> "learns," will
"reconstitute" the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.N.</ENAMEX> weapons inspection <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> to "make it more effective as
it searches for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX>."

            A nationwide poll that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> plays big both in an off-lead
story and a big top-of-the-page graphic suggests that by a large margin
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> support the use of force against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> and additionally think the
purpose of an airstrike should be to remove <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX> from power. Most
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX> also dismiss the suggestion that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> is preparing a
move against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> as a means of distracting attention from his own
problems.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> lead reports that in separate meetings <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary of State</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albright</ENAMEX> privately scolded <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Palestinian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX>, telling them she is
"sick and tired of hearing you give me a pile full of complaints about the
other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX>." The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> credits this quotation to "a senior <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> official
with direct knowledge of the conversations." The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> in its <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albright</ENAMEX>
story <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> the comment the same way. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gee</ENAMEX>, given that the scoldings were
private, and that the knowledge was direct, who could that be?)

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> , like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAT</ENAMEX> , also mentions <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albright</ENAMEX>'s pledge to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX>
of an "iron-clad commitment" to defend <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> in case it is attacked by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX>,
but doesn't include <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Netanyahu</ENAMEX>'s response, reported by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAT</ENAMEX> , that unlike
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX> during the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Gulf War</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> will now feel free to defend itself. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> front-page <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albright</ENAMEX> piece adds a further wrinkle, noting that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albright</ENAMEX> responded, "It is up to each <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> to determine its own way to
defend itself."

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> lead points out that the main new social programs of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinton</ENAMEX> budget--such as child-care programs and new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> hiring--are linked
to congressional approval of the national tobacco settlement. And if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>
fails to enact the tobacco deal thereby killing these programs, says the paper,
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX> come away with a potent political issue: the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> favored the
tobacco industry over <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and health. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Murray</ENAMEX> thinks there will be some
sort of tobacco legislation <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>, he says, is moving towards
enacting the parts of the settlement the tobacco <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> don't like while
denying them the part they want--immunity from future lawsuits.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WSJ</ENAMEX> reports that the GDP jumped <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.3 percent</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the last quarter</TIMEX>
of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX> and that for all of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>, the economy grew <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.8 percent</NUMEX>, the best rate
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten years</TIMEX>.

            The most newsy development in what "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Today's Papers</ENAMEX>" had decided to call the
Whitefluid scandal is that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX>, as reported in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Monica</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> revealed on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of his <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> (!) chat show appearances that
it's possible his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client</ENAMEX>, who owns a share of a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Australian</ENAMEX> condo, was
tape-recorded offering it to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Linda Tripp</ENAMEX> in return for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tripp</ENAMEX> denying knowing
about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX>'s claim that she had a sexual relationship with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">President</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>.
