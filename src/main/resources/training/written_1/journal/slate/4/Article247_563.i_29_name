               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> leads with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>'s announcement <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> of a new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">airline</ENAMEX> safety
agenda designed to cut crashes by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80 percent</NUMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next ten years</TIMEX>, primarily
by reducing engine explosions and episodes of flying unaware into the ground.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Angeles Times</ENAMEX> leads with a new study coming out in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JAMA</ENAMEX> today
concluding that properly prescribed drugs kill <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 100,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX>,
far more than previously believed. (The study is also covered on the WP
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAT</ENAMEX> front pages.) The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX>
lead is the decision by a federal court voiding the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> rule requiring
that television and radio <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stations</ENAMEX> seek minority job <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">applicants</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> goes with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office of</ENAMEX>
Management and Budget leaving to run <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fannie Mae</ENAMEX>.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> explains that the court decision could have far-reaching impact on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">broadcasters</ENAMEX> and the future of
affirmative action because it's the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time that a federal appeals court
has evaluated an affirmative action program that used not quotas but goals. In
effect, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> said it didn't see the difference, holding that goals still
tended to promote numerical targets and hence hiring on purely racial grounds.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> notes that although the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX>'s affirmative action hiring goals also
target <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, this decision does not address those, although <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> say the
decision will probably lead to eventual challenges of them as well. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> notes that this is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> time in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four years</TIMEX> a major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX>
affirmative action program has been overturned: <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three years ago</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> did
away with tax breaks for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> selling broadcast <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stations</ENAMEX> to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minorities</ENAMEX>.

            The LAT front plus inside stories in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> and WP
detail how <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> containers filled with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">12,000 gallons</NUMEX> of napalm are still riding the rails--destination
still unknown--after the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> that was to recycle the shipment
decided not to accept it, on the heels of protests from several midwestern
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> coverage refers to the substance as a
"<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vietnam</ENAMEX>-era" <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapon</ENAMEX> and states that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> military discontinued its use a
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">quarter century ago</TIMEX>. On the other hand, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> says, "In the gulf war,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">allied</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> reportedly dropped napalm canisters on <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Iraqi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fortifications</ENAMEX> and
tank obstacles." Which is it?

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth Starr</ENAMEX> are battling over who should
investigate whether or not some of conservative money<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">-man</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Mellon</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scaife</ENAMEX>'s dough ended up being paid to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witness</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Hale</ENAMEX> to influence his
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whitewater</ENAMEX> testimony against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Clinton</ENAMEX>. Meanwhile, reports the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> ,
the new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">publisher</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The American Spectator</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Terry Eastland</ENAMEX>, is trying
to find out what became of the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">nearly $2 million</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scaife</ENAMEX> grants to investigate <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">magazine</ENAMEX> received. So far, it appears, says the paper, much of it went to the
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> administering it. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eastland</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Henderson</ENAMEX>, of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> staff
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Boynton</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX>, paid themselves fees of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$12,000 and $15,000</NUMEX> per
month respectively.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pulitzers</ENAMEX> were awarded <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">dailies</ENAMEX> took their annual
opportunity to say nice things about themselves in straight news stories (the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> was able to go with the front-page headline, "Katharine
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Graham</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philip Roth Win Literary Pulitzers</ENAMEX>"). It remains curious to "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Today</ENAMEX>'s
Papers" however, that plays and books (and string quartets) can win
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">journalism</ENAMEX>'s most esteemed <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prize</ENAMEX>, but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazines</ENAMEX> cannot. (Not to mention on-line
magazines.)

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> reports that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Journal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">columnist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stuart Taylor</ENAMEX>
was dropped <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> from his regular position on the "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">NewsHour with Jim</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lehrer</ENAMEX>." <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lehrer</ENAMEX> said on <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">last night</TIMEX>'s broadcast that "we believe <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stuart</ENAMEX>'s recent
commentaries in print and on other TV programs about the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX> investigation
have caused some blurring of the lines and confusion about his role with us."
What <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lehrer</ENAMEX> was beating around the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bush</ENAMEX> about is that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Taylor</ENAMEX> recently admitted
he'd talked to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ken Starr</ENAMEX> about coming to work for him, and then decided not to.
It's far from clear to "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Today's Papers</ENAMEX>" why this is any kind of a firing
offense. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX> of all, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Taylor</ENAMEX> came right out and said these talks had taken
place. More importantly, talking with a news subject about a possible job is
not always grounds for dismissal on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lehrer</ENAMEX>'s show, which has not been so severe
with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commentator</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Gergen</ENAMEX>, who while still on the show talked to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bill</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> about coming to work for him before actually doing so.

            If you've just now finished your tax return, you'll be glad to know that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> is springing into action with a fundamental tax law change. The
Wall Street <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal</ENAMEX> reports that a bill already
passed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> and awaiting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> approval calls for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers</ENAMEX> to start
writing checks to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> instead of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX>. "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Backers</ENAMEX> hope," says the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal</ENAMEX> , "this change will send a clearer message to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers</ENAMEX> [about]
where their money goes." Why not go all the way and let us start writing tax
checks to say, "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Dole</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Condo Payments</ENAMEX>," "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House Lawyers' Salaries</ENAMEX>," or
"<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Linda Tripp</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Tape and Battery Account"</ENAMEX>?
