            The latest ultraright
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rumbling</ENAMEX> comes from remote <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Texas</ENAMEX>, where a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">militia</ENAMEX>-allied <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> has
proclaimed itself the lawful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> of the independent <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Republic of Texas</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ROT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> have declared war on both the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>, which they view as illegitimate "occupiers" of their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>. An armed
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ROT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">faction</ENAMEX> made headlines on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 27</TIMEX> by kidnapping <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and holding
them on the grounds of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ROT</ENAMEX> "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">embassy</ENAMEX>," an attached <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trailer</ENAMEX> and shed outside
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ft. Davis</ENAMEX> (population <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,200</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Police</ENAMEX> surrounded the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">compound</ENAMEX> and
avoided violence by exchanging a jailed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ROT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hostages</ENAMEX>.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ROT</ENAMEX>
is the brainchild of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard McLaren</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Missouri</ENAMEX>-born automobile-manual
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> and insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">salesman</ENAMEX>. McLaren, a vociferous opponent of all taxation,
declared in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX> his unique finding that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> has never legally
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">annexed Texas</ENAMEX>. He says that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, which won its independence from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1836</TIMEX>, joined the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">union</ENAMEX> illegally in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1845</TIMEX>. Under <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McLaren</ENAMEX>'s reading of
international law, a treaty must be struck between sovereign <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nations</ENAMEX> prior to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">annexation</ENAMEX>. No such <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> treaty was passed, nor does it appear that any
such treaty could have passed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1845</TIMEX>. Treaties require a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two-thirds</NUMEX>
vote of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Senate</ENAMEX>, and a bare majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senators</ENAMEX> approved the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>'s
admission into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">union</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McLaren</ENAMEX> maintains that because <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> was illegally annexed,
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Texans</ENAMEX> are not <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX>, have no obligation to obey federal laws, and are
owed war reparations by the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 1995</TIMEX>, he and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>
other radical anti-tax <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activists</ENAMEX>, mainly from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Texas</ENAMEX>, declared their
intention to re-establish the usurped authority of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ROT</ENAMEX>.

            Historians dismiss <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McLaren</ENAMEX>'s
argument: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) His citation of the international law of annexation is vague. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>)
If his international-law objection is valid, why didn't anti-slavery senators
who opposed admission of another slaveholding state raise it at the time? <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) A
majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Texans</ENAMEX> voted in favor of annexation in an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1845</TIMEX> plebiscite. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) And
even if the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1845</TIMEX> annexation was illegal, the argument is moot: <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> and the
other secessionist states rejoined the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">union</ENAMEX> after their defeat in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Civil</ENAMEX>
War.

            According
to the liberal watchdog <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern Poverty Law Center</ENAMEX>, the number of armed
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">militias</ENAMEX> has grown since the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oklahoma City</ENAMEX> bombing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years ago</TIMEX>, and now
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">exceeds 380</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ROT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> employ rhetoric similar to that of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">militias</ENAMEX>,
condemning taxation and lax protection of property rights.

            
And they employ similar tactics. Like the
Freemen, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Montana</ENAMEX> militia <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> that held federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> at bay for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">81</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ROT</ENAMEX> has filed scores of liens on property owned by their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foes</ENAMEX>, a
tactic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> call "paper warfare." A blizzard of liens has fallen on state
property, which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ROT</ENAMEX> considers illegally confiscated. Other bogus liens have
been filed across the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> on private property targeted at random. By clogging
state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX> and tying up real-estate sales, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ROT</ENAMEX> says it hopes to garner
political attention. Like their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soul mates</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Montana</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ROT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> have also
issued <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$3 million</NUMEX> worth of bad checks, purchasing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX>, computers, and
provisions.

            As ROT
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ambassador</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McLaren</ENAMEX> issues passports. He also campaigns for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Nations</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">recognition</ENAMEX> of his "republic," believing that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> scuttled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.N.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali</ENAMEX>'s campaign for a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">term last year</TIMEX>
because he was sympathetic to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ROT</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal</ENAMEX> dissension has reduced the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>'s numbers in
recent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX>. From the start, the sect purged <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>, including its founding
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>, who failed to toe a militant line. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ROT</ENAMEX> split into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">factions</ENAMEX>--the smaller <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>, led by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McLaren</ENAMEX>, advocated an alignment with militias
and plotted a violent strategy to remove the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>, the
other eschewed violence and dissociated itself from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">McLaren</ENAMEX>. On its Web site, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nonviolent</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">faction</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McLaren</ENAMEX> has "gone completely off the deep end."

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McLaren</ENAMEX>'s
confrontation with law enforcement has been <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> in the making. After a judge
ordered him to cease filing bogus liens, he continued and was found in contempt
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX>. Wanted on charges of burglary, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McLaren</ENAMEX> holed up in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ft. Davis</ENAMEX>, where
armed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guards</ENAMEX> kept round-the-clock watch. Because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McLaren</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> spotted
armed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> arriving in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trucks</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Idaho</ENAMEX> license <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plates</ENAMEX>, it is believed that
some of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> currently residing in the "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">embassy</ENAMEX>" may belong to
other rightist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>.

            
The standoff was sparked <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 27</TIMEX> when police
arrested <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ROT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>--one because he refused to display license plates on
his <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicle</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McLaren</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">followers</ENAMEX> retaliated by taking as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hostages</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX>
who had long clamored for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">leader</ENAMEX>'s arrest. After the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hostage</ENAMEX> exchange,
talks continued but have been unsuccessful, while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McLaren</ENAMEX>'s rhetoric has grown
increasingly apocalyptic.

            Fear of repeating the deadly
clash between federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Branch Davidian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cult members</ENAMEX> has deterred
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> from raiding the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">compound</ENAMEX>. Also, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> take seriously <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McLaren</ENAMEX>'s claim
that he coordinated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">militias</ENAMEX> throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>, who will react violently in
response to a police assault. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday, April 30</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pecos</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">80 miles</NUMEX>
from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ft. Davis</ENAMEX>, arrested <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> who were carrying <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">explosives</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX> and
admitted they were headed to join <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McLaren</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Secessionists</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hawaii</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alaska</ENAMEX> argue that the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> failed to consult <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">natives</ENAMEX> before
annexing these <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">territories</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alaska</ENAMEX> movement, like the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> one, stems from
a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">libertarian aversion</ENAMEX> to the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hawaiians</ENAMEX> hope to restore
the monarchy ousted by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1893</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hawaiians</ENAMEX> voted in favor of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">secession</ENAMEX> in a nonbinding referendum <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX>, but few expect the movement to
succeed.
