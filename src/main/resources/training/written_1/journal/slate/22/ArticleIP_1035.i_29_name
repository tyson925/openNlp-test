            <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Forty</NUMEX>-<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</TIMEX> after
Brown <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">vs. Board of Education</ENAMEX> , what has happened to school desegregation?
How integrated are <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>? What is the legal status of court-ordered
desegregation? Whatever became of "busing"?

            There have been <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> stages
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> jurisprudence on desegregation since the landmark <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1954</TIMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX> case. In the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> stage, from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1955 to 1974</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> gave
federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">district courts</ENAMEX> broad authority to impose remedies for segregation,
including busing. In the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> stage, from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1974 to 1991</TIMEX>, it curtailed
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">authority</ENAMEX> of the lower <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX> by virtually forbidding desegregation across
district lines, and by requiring lower <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX> to give greater leeway to local
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX>. In the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> stage, which began in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">high court</ENAMEX> has
eased the way for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> to be released altogether from desegregation decrees.
Nevertheless, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 500</NUMEX> school districts still operate to some extent under a
federal desegregation decree.

            Has it
worked? The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Education</ENAMEX> reported recently that the share of
black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> attending "intensely segregated" <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90 percent</NUMEX> or
higher minority) fell from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">64 percent</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1968</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">34 percent</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX>. In the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South</ENAMEX>, the share of black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> attending majority-white <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> went from
<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">.001 percent</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1954</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">39 percent</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX>. However, no national database has
tracked racial balance in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent decades</TIMEX>; reporting
requirements are few and uneven.

            What's happened with mandatory busing ? In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1971</TIMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Carolina</ENAMEX> case of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Swann</ENAMEX> vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Charlotte</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mecklenberg Board of</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Education</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> granted federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judges</ENAMEX> the authority to order
districtwide busing to desegregate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>. Although public <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">opposition</ENAMEX> has been
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">great</ENAMEX>, no subsequent court ruling has ever invalidated mandatory busing.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Hundreds</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">districts</ENAMEX> still operate mandatory busing programs. (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only one</NUMEX> large
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Seattle</ENAMEX>, has ever voluntarily undertaken busing.) However, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> signaled a possible shift in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX> when it allowed a federally
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">supervised Georgia</ENAMEX> school district to regain control over busing even before
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">district</ENAMEX> had fully desegregated.

            The legal
basis for court-ordered busing and other measures is that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>
have purposely acted to keep the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> segregated. As a practical matter,
though, the main reason <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> remain heavily segregated is that
residential housing patterns are segregated. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX>, the black
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> largest metro areas in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">North</ENAMEX> were so concentrated
that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">78 percent</NUMEX> would have had to move in order to achieve residential racial
balance. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1974</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> invalidated a desegregation plan that involved
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">busing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> between heavily black <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Detroit</ENAMEX> and its heavily white suburbs.
There could be no remedies across district lines for racial imbalance
within district lines, without proof that the lines themselves were
drawn for racially discriminatory reasons. The case, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milliken</ENAMEX> vs.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX> , was a turning point, for it deemed that voluntary "white flight"
from urban <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> was beyond the power of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX> to remedy.

            
Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-1970s</TIMEX>, magnet
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>-- specialized or especially high-quality <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> designed to draw
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> voluntarily from a wide geographical area--have been an increasingly
popular way to desegregate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school systems</ENAMEX> without resorting to mandatory
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">busing</ENAMEX>. A recent ruling marks the limits of this method. Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1977</TIMEX>, the judge
supervising the desegregation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kansas City</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mo.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> had ordered over
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1.7 billion</NUMEX> in expenditures for a system of magnet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last June</TIMEX>, in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Missouri</ENAMEX> vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jenkins</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> ruled that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> had gone
too far. He could not require the open-ended financing of magnet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>, and
he could not use magnet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> to attract suburban <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kansas City</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>, when the suburbs had done nothing unlawful.

            Does
court-ordered desegregation ever end ? At first, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> said
school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> would be under federal supervision until they had discharged
the "affirmative duty" to eliminate the "vestiges" of segregation, "root and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">branch</ENAMEX>." That standard has changed dramatically. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> held that
once a school district has made a "good faith" effort and taken all
"practicable" steps to end segregation, it should be released from its court
order. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX>, the court ruled that a federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX>'s jurisdiction can be
terminated before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> have achieved full compliance with a
desegregation order. In both opinions, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> placed a premium on returning
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> to local control.

            As the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">judiciary</ENAMEX> has backed off desegregation,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">plaintiffs</ENAMEX> increasingly have turned to state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX> . Many state
constitutions have provisions relating specifically to education. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Connecticut Supreme Court</ENAMEX> ruled <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this summer</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sheff</ENAMEX> vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O'Neill</ENAMEX> that
the segregation of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hartford</ENAMEX>'s public <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> violated the equitable education
provisions of the state constitution. The ruling was significant for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two</TIMEX>
reasons. First, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> found no intentional discrimination, but ruled that
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">district</ENAMEX>'s segregation was in itself unconstitutional. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, the
court declared that the cause of the segregation was the practice of basing
district lines on municipal boundaries. Thus it undid, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Connecticut</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> major restraints on court-ordered desegregation.

            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX>, attention
has turned away from integration and toward the issue of inequalities in
school financing . Most public <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> are financed primarily by local
property taxes. Even at the same or a lower tax rate , more affluent
(largely white) <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">districts</ENAMEX> can spend more per <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> than poorer (largely
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">black</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">districts</ENAMEX> with a smaller tax base . The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Supreme Court</ENAMEX> has
declined opportunities to find this disparity unconstitutional, but several
state supreme <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX> have taken it up.
