            Besides taxes themselves,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Dole</ENAMEX> has made a campaign issue of the tax <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">collector</ENAMEX>. And along with taxes,
he pledges to cut the tax-collection <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bureaucracy</ENAMEX>. In fact, he has compared the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal Revenue Service</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KGB</ENAMEX> (the old <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> secret <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX>), and
promises to "end the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> as we know it." Apart from the taxes themselves, does
the process of collecting them impose an unreasonable burden on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">citizenry</ENAMEX>?

            
               Tax
forms: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">About one-third</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">filers</ENAMEX> use either <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1040EZ</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1040A</TIMEX> forms.
Both are for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with taxable incomes of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">less than $50,000</NUMEX> and few or no
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">complications</ENAMEX>, and some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> can fill them out in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a few minutes</TIMEX>. The regular
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1040</TIMEX> (the "long form") is for those with taxable incomes <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">over $50,000</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX>,
who claim credits or deductions, realize capital gains, and/or file separately
from their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spouses</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> estimates that this form takes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">almost 12 hours</TIMEX> to
complete. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">About half</NUMEX> of the total taxpaying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">58.8 million</NUMEX>) files the
long form.

            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> has adopted faster, high-tech
methods of filing. If you qualify for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1040EZ</TIMEX> form, are single with no
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dependents</ENAMEX>, and live at the same address as you did <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX>, you can file
over the telephone using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TeleFile</ENAMEX> system--a process that takes about
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 minutes</TIMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first year</TIMEX> in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">TeleFile</ENAMEX> was widely available, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.8</NUMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.4 percent</NUMEX>) used it. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Taxpayers</ENAMEX> can file any type of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1040</TIMEX> form
electronically --and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 percent</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers</ENAMEX> did so in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>. Another <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>
percent filed a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1040PC</NUMEX> form, meaning that they worked out their taxes using a
personal computer .

            About
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">three-quarters</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers</ENAMEX> get a refund (meaning that they paid too
much over the course of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX>). For tax <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year 1995</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> received <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">116.3</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">million</ENAMEX> returns and sent out <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">88.7 million</NUMEX> refunds. The average turnaround for
refunds is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38 days</TIMEX> for paper forms and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21 days</TIMEX> for returns filed telephonically
and electronically

            
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dole</ENAMEX> has promised to rein in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> ,
calling their methods "crass and callous." Since the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> relies on
self-reported income, it audits returns to ensure payment. Compliance is far
from perfect. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX> (the most recent numbers) <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">an estimated $94 billion</NUMEX> went
unpaid out of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $551 billion</NUMEX> owed in personal income taxes. In other
words, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">17 cents</NUMEX>--<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost one-fifth</NUMEX>--of every dollar of personal taxes owed goes
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">uncollected</ENAMEX>.

            In fiscal
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year 1995</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> completed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.9 million</NUMEX> audits--an audit rate of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.67 percent</NUMEX>.
But <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX> was unusually high--especially for low-income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">filers</ENAMEX>--because of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
special compliance programs, including a crackdown on widespread abuse of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Earned Income Tax Credit</ENAMEX>. The audit rate usually averages just above <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1 percent</NUMEX>,
or one out of every <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> audited <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2 percent</NUMEX> of those
with incomes of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">less than $25,000</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1 percent</NUMEX> of those <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between $25,000</NUMEX> and
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$100,000</NUMEX>; and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">almost 3 percent</NUMEX> of those whose incomes topped <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$100,000</NUMEX>.

            Owing the government money is not like owing anyone else.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> has special <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX> for collecting taxes that are overdue (plus
penalties and interest). These <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX> include a tax lien on the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">taxpayer</ENAMEX>'s property. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> filed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">799,000</NUMEX> notices of federal
tax liens. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> can also levy property held by <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX>,
such as wages or money deposited in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX>, and served <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.7 million</NUMEX> notices of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">levy</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>. (A lien claims property only as security against a debt, while a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">levy</ENAMEX> actually takes it.) Finally, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> can seize property and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sell</ENAMEX> it to collect what it is owed. It made <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11,000</NUMEX> such seizures in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX>
can also sue for tax fraud. It initiated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,698</NUMEX> criminal fraud
investigations in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX> convicted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,945</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,387</NUMEX> went to
prison. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Taxpayers</ENAMEX> who feel they're being cheated can also take the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> to
court, which happened <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11,000</NUMEX> times in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>.

            
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Dole</ENAMEX> proposes to "cut the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bureaucrats</ENAMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 percent</NUMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>." At <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the close of 1995</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">114,000</NUMEX> people
worked for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX>. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> will collect <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $1.4 trillion</NUMEX> in taxes this
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">About 19,000</NUMEX>--<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">17 percent</NUMEX>--are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">another 8,000</NUMEX> are revenue
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> charged with collecting unpaid taxes, interest, and penalties. The
remaining <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">74 percent</NUMEX> process tax returns, provide help to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers</ENAMEX>, and carry
out other administrative and adjudicative functions. The budget of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$7.63 billion</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$4.24 billion</NUMEX> of which went to tax law enforcement.

            Recent congressional actions
have moved the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> in the direction <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dole</ENAMEX> wants to take it. The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 1997</TIMEX>
budget shrinks the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> appropriation by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$342 million</NUMEX>. Furthermore, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>
recently passed a "Taxpayer <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Bill of Rights</ENAMEX>" that makes it easier for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers</ENAMEX>
to sue the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> and increases the amount of damages that can be collected in
these suits. It also increases the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX>' responsibility to notify <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers</ENAMEX> when
it is going to conduct enforcement action and creates other new procedural
rights for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers</ENAMEX>.

            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1982</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dole</ENAMEX> called for
increasing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> in order to collect more unpaid taxes. According to
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX>, every dollar spent on enforcement brings in a return of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$4</NUMEX> in
revenue.
