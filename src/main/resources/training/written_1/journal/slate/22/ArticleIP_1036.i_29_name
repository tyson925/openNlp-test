            Even <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a fairly short</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midday</TIMEX>
telephone call from, say, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX>, can cost <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$10</NUMEX>. Yet, that same
amount will buy you a month of an online service that includes unlimited e-mail
all over the world. For <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$20</NUMEX>, you can make <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three hours</TIMEX> of long-distance
telephone calls. Or, for the same <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$20</NUMEX>, you can surf the Web day and night for a
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">month</TIMEX>, download as much data as your modem can handle, enjoy unlimited e-mail,
and even--if you own the right software--make as many telephone calls to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">York</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Timbuktu</ENAMEX> as your heart desires.

            How is
this possible? Worldly cybernauts may find the question na√Øve--though fewer
know the answer than think they do. To <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">newcomers</ENAMEX>, the economics of the Internet
is among its greatest mysteries. Herewith, a primer.

            First, the wrong answer: that the Internet is high-tech
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pork</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense Department</ENAMEX> created the Internet in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late '60s</TIMEX>, and
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> supported the Internet heavily from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the '70s</TIMEX> till the early
'90s. But no more: The last major subsidy ended in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>. Now, except for a few
small, shrinking, and unnecessary federal grants, the Internet is a commercial
concern. Telecommunications <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>, computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>, and Internet service
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">providers</ENAMEX> (ISPs) built, own, and operate all the phone lines and computer
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> that comprise the Net.

            The
real explanation of the Internet's <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cheapness</ENAMEX> lies in the difference between the
telephone system and the Net. (A note: The rest of this article applies to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX>. The same basic rules apply to Internet <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> elsewhere, except
that they probably pay more for Internet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">service</ENAMEX>, and lots more for
phone service.)

            Consider a typical long-distance telephone call from
me in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">D.C.</ENAMEX>, to my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aunt</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX>. My long-distance company
(which happens to be <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCI</ENAMEX>) gives me an uninterrupted, real-time circuit between
my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aunt</ENAMEX>'s. In exchange, I pay <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCI</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about 20 cents</NUMEX> for every minute
I'm connected. Of that <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">20 cents</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCI</ENAMEX> pays <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 2</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3 cents</NUMEX> to my local phone
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bell Atlantic</ENAMEX>, for carrying the call from my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCI</ENAMEX>'s lines. It
pays another fraction (probably <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5 cents</NUMEX>) to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pacific Bell</ENAMEX> for delivering the
call the last <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">few miles</NUMEX> to my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aunt</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCI</ENAMEX> pockets the rest.

            The
actual cost of a long-distance call--after all capital costs have been
counted--is only slightly more than that of a local call. But for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX> have mandated artificially cheap local phone service and
artificially expensive long-distance service. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCI</ENAMEX>'s payments to local phone
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>--called "access charges"--are a subsidy. It costs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pacific Bell</ENAMEX> less
than <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a cent</NUMEX> to deliver my call. The other <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4 cents</NUMEX> are payback for giving my
aunt cheap and unlimited local calls.

            Now, consider the Internet. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> very important way,
using the Net is no bargain. You need <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2,000</NUMEX> worth of computer hardware to
connect to it, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $1,960</NUMEX> more than the price of a telephone. But once you've
got the gear, the Internet beats telephone costs for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> significant
reasons.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. The Internet
exploits low local phone rates. Unless you live somewhere remote, you reach
the Internet by making a local call to your Internet <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Service Provider</ENAMEX>.
Your <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ISP</ENAMEX>, in turn, leases super-fast long-distance fiber-optic cable from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCI</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sprint</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX>, regional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bells</ENAMEX>, and other telecommunications <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>.
(These <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX> have plenty of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber</ENAMEX> to spare.) These fiber-optic lines carry your
Internet traffic around the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, delivering it to "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Network Access Points</ENAMEX>,"
which link different <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> like highway interchanges. When your data reach a
Network <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Access Point</ENAMEX>, they hop on a line owned by another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> and travel to
their destination. But because the Internet travels on leased lines, the data
entirely avoid the long-distance phone <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>' own <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX>, and
therefore avoid the access charges the long-distance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> must pay to
local phone <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> on normal telephone calls.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. Talk isn't cheap,
but data are . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ISPs</ENAMEX> can offer unlimited access on their lines for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two</TIMEX>
reasons. First, it saves them billing costs; telephone <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>, by contrast,
spend <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">billions</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every year</TIMEX> calculating who used what line and when. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>,
Internet data transmission is remarkably efficient. When you make a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10-minute</TIMEX>
long-distance voice call, the phone <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> maintains an open circuit from end
to end. You pay for every second, even if you're on hold. When you go online to
check out a Web page, you may spend <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 minutes</TIMEX> reading the page (and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 minutes</TIMEX>
dialed into your ISP). But you only use the Internet for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a few seconds</TIMEX>:
the time it takes to send your request to the page's Web server and for the
server to deliver the page to you. For <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the other 9 minutes and 50-plus seconds</TIMEX>,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ISP</ENAMEX>'s long-distance line is free. Many Internet <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> can share a line that
would need to be occupied full time by a telephone call.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>.
There are no guarantees on the Internet . Telephone service is a promise:
You can be almost certain that you can complete a call immediately to anyone
else with a phone. Internet service is a shrug: You can be reasonably sure, but
no more, that you can send your data to another Internet user pretty
quickly.

            The Internet is an uncertain network because it is
"packet-switched." This means that data are broken up into small pieces, or
packets. Each packet seeks the cheapest route, at the instant it is sent, to
the destination. When all the packets arrive at that destination, a computer
reassembles them. Packet switching is a frugal, efficient way to send data from
point a to point b (albeit via points c, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">d</ENAMEX>, q, and k). But packet switching is
not terribly reliable: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Packets</ENAMEX> routinely get lost or delayed, crippling
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">communication</ENAMEX>.

            
Internet telephony, one of the coolest new online applications, illustrates
packet switching's drawbacks. If <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> Internet <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> own the right software,
they can talk by telephone over the Net. It is miraculously cheap: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Speech</ENAMEX> is
digitized, packet-ized, and sent over the Net, for no more than the cost of
online access. But because the Net gets clogged and packets are waylaid, the
sound quality is low and interruptions are common.

            The Internet may soon be less of a bargain . It is
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">clogging</ENAMEX> as more and more Net heads use packet-intensive, real-time
applications such as Internet telephony and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RealAudio</ENAMEX>. These "streaming"
applications swallow enormous chunks of bandwidth for long periods of time,
eliminating one of the Net's chief economies. There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> principal
remedies for Internet congestion:

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ISPs</ENAMEX> can lease more and
bigger lines.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Customers</ENAMEX> who want to
ensure fast access can replace their modems with pricey, high-bandwidth ISDN
lines, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">T1</NUMEX> lines, cable modems, and so on.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ISPs</ENAMEX> can discriminate
between heavy and light <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Customers</ENAMEX> will pay a premium to use streaming
applications or send high-priority messages.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Remedies 1</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> are
already taking place. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> is coming soon. All of them will make the
Internet easier to use. And in the short term, all of them will make the
Internet more expensive.
