            Suddenly, adultery is big
news. But what exactly is adultery? Is it illegal?

            In case you have lost track
of all the adultery stories in the news, here is the list:

            Former football star
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Gifford</ENAMEX> was photographed cuddling with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> who was not his
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> (talk-show <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kathy Lee Gifford</ENAMEX>). He later admitted to having an affair
with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>. Special angle: A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tabloid</ENAMEX> paid her to seduce him.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Kennedy</ENAMEX> , son
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Robert</ENAMEX>, admitted to having an affair with his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14-year-old</TIMEX> baby
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sitter</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Georgia</ENAMEX> gubernatorial
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike Bowers</ENAMEX> admitted to a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10-year</TIMEX> extramarital affair. Special
angle: When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bowers</ENAMEX> was <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney general</ENAMEX>, he prosecuted a gay <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> in what became
a famous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> case ( <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bowers</ENAMEX> vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hardwick</ENAMEX> ) upholding anti-sodomy
laws.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Police</ENAMEX> found comedian
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eddie Murphy</ENAMEX> , a married <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>, with a transvestite <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prostitute</ENAMEX> in his
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>.

            The newly appointed
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC News</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">David Westin</ENAMEX> , acknowledged his affair with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX>
public-relations <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sherrie Rollins</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> of political consultant
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ed Rollins</ENAMEX>.

            A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>-support suit was
filed against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger Clinton</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX>, because he
conceived a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> with a married <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX>.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX> discharged
pilot <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kelly Flinn</ENAMEX> because she disobeyed orders to end her relationship
with a married soccer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coach</ENAMEX>.

            Sgt. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Maj.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gene</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McKinney</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Army</ENAMEX>'s top enlisted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldier</ENAMEX>, was charged with adultery, as
well as with sexually harassing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> servicewomen.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ralston</ENAMEX> 's candidacy for the chairmanship of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joint Chiefs of Staff</ENAMEX> was
derailed because he had had a relationship with another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> while separated
from his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>.

            Army Maj.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Longhouser</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aberdeen Proving Ground</ENAMEX>, retired after
an affair he had had <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five years ago</TIMEX> became public knowledge.

            Most societies prohibit adultery--sex between a married
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> and someone other than his or her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spouse</ENAMEX>--at least, formally. A
handful--the most researched is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tribe</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Alaskan Inuit</ENAMEX>--have condoned
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">affairs</ENAMEX>. Tolerance of the practice varies. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prime Minister</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fran√ßois Mitterrand</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mistress</ENAMEX> stood next to his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> at his funeral. In some
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">societies</ENAMEX>, adulterers are still stoned to death. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> falls
somewhere between these extremes.

            
               <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> theories explain
the prohibition's genesis. One is evolutionary: <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Men</ENAMEX> must determine which
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> they sire, something only strict <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">monogamy</ENAMEX> can ensure. Another is
economic: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prohibiting</ENAMEX> adultery preserves monogamous relationships and thence
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>, whose labor was needed for agriculture. Finally, it is said that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX>
enshrined the adultery prohibition in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ten Commandments</ENAMEX>--of which it is the
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">seventh</NUMEX>--to make their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> more cohesive and to distinguish themselves from
surrounding polygamous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tribes</ENAMEX>.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX> inherited <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> common law, which made adultery, as well as
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fornication</ENAMEX> (sex between unmarried <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>) and sodomy (oral and anal sex),
punishable crimes. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid</TIMEX> and late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19 th centuries</TIMEX>, when states
wrote their criminal codes, they incorporated these sex laws. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twenty-six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>
continue to have anti-adultery laws 
               on 
               the 
               books .
These laws vary considerably. Some define adultery as any intercourse outside
marriage. According to others, it occurs when a married <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> lives with
someone other than his or her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spouse</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Virginia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Carolina</ENAMEX>,
simply "to lewdly and lasciviously associate" with anyone other than one's
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spouse</ENAMEX> is to be adulterous.

            
Is a single 
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> in an
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adulterous</ENAMEX> relationship guilty of adultery? All but <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> punish both
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> involved. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colorado</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Georgia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nebraska</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Dakota</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Utah</ENAMEX> only
punish the married <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">District of Columbia</ENAMEX> and in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Michigan</ENAMEX>, when a
married <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> sleeps with an unmarried <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>, only the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> is guilty, but when a
married <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> sleeps with an unmarried <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>, they're both guilty. Most laws make
no exceptions for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couples</ENAMEX> who are separated or in the process of obtaining a
divorce. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Punishments</ENAMEX> also vary. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adultery</ENAMEX> is a felony in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Massachusetts</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Michigan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oklahoma</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Idaho</ENAMEX>, and a misdemeanor everywhere else.

            In
practice, adultery laws matter 
               little : Only <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> case--against an
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alabama</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>--has been prosecuted in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last five years</TIMEX>. Most <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> have not
enforced their adultery laws since <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War</ENAMEX> II.

            Before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1970s</TIMEX>, when every <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> passed a "no fault
divorce " law, adultery was usually the only reason <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX> would grant
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">divorces</ENAMEX>. (Under no-fault divorce, no specific reason is required.) Charges of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adultery</ENAMEX> also can be used to get a more favorable divorce settlement.

            Adultery
also matters in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">military</ENAMEX> . The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Uniform Code</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Military Justice</ENAMEX>, the
military criminal code, bars married <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">servicemen</ENAMEX> from having extramarital sex
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">unmarried servicemen</ENAMEX> from sleeping with married <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. However, the rules
come with qualifications. They say that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">military</ENAMEX> will only prosecute when a
case harms "good order and discipline" and when the adultery is "of a nature to
bring discredit upon the armed forces." The ambiguity is intentional: Visits to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prostitutes</ENAMEX> are not reasons for a court-martial, but long-term affairs and
affairs between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX> are considered dangerous and deserving of
punishment.

            
Unlike civilian <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-adultery</ENAMEX> laws, the
military rules are sometimes enforced. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last year</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX> alone prosecuted
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">67</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX> for adultery. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Critics</ENAMEX> say that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">military</ENAMEX> applies these laws
hypocritically, allowing high-ranking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">male officers</ENAMEX> to get away with affairs
but not <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> or rank-and-file <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Cohen</ENAMEX> has
ordered a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">commission</ENAMEX> to clarify the guidelines in an effort to
eliminate perceived 
               inconsistencies .

            Adultery
still plays a role in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catholic</ENAMEX> 
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">annulments</ENAMEX> . The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catholic Church</ENAMEX>
still does not consider divorces legitimate: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marriage</ENAMEX>, it says, is a sacrament
and insoluble. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> considers a divorced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> who remarries to be living
in a state of sin--i.e., committing adultery--unless a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church tribunal</ENAMEX> annuls
the previous marriage(s). An annulment is a declaration that a marriage was not
legitimate to begin with. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adultery</ENAMEX> is grounds for annulment, on the theory that
if a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> knew that his or her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spouse</ENAMEX> had a predilection toward infidelity,
the marriage would not have occurred in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> place. Until recently the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">church</ENAMEX> was stingy with annulments. But <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> it granted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 60,000</NUMEX>,
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> of them in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sheila Rauch Kennedy</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ex-wife</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Kennedy II</ENAMEX>, has garnered much attention for her recent book,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shattered Faith</ENAMEX> , which criticizes the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>'s annulment policies. She
claims that the church hurts <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> of annulled marriages when it claims that
their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> were never legitimately wed.

            How widespread is adultery? <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alfred Kinsey</ENAMEX>'s famous
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1948</TIMEX> survey of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> sexual behavior found that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> had
cheated on their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wives</ENAMEX>. More accurate, more recent research shows that the
prevalence of adultery is not as high. A survey taken <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years ago</TIMEX> by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Chicago</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Opinion Research Center</ENAMEX> shows that slightly
<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 11 percent</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">21 percent</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> admitted to having an
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adulterous</ENAMEX> affair during their lives.
