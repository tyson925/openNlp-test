            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last month</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> District
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Royce Lamberth</ENAMEX> ruled that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aide</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ira Magaziner</ENAMEX>--the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX> health-care proposal--and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> had
"deceived" his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> in a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX> affidavit. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Officials</ENAMEX> had "run amok" in their
response to a suit filed against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lamberth</ENAMEX>, and he ordered
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> to cover the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$285,864</NUMEX> legal bill incurred by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">plaintiffs</ENAMEX>.

            The
"deception" that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lamberth</ENAMEX> complained about was contained in one sentence
of a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>-page affidavit filed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Magaziner</ENAMEX> in response to the suit. Did
Magaziner deceive the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX>, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lamberth</ENAMEX> insists he did?

            First, a little history: <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> formed a
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>-member <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">task force</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first month</TIMEX> of his presidency, appointed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> as chair, and gave them <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">100 days</TIMEX> to draft new health-care legislation.
Magaziner, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">task force</ENAMEX>, organized an "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">interdepartmental</ENAMEX> working
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX>"--comprising <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bureaucrats</ENAMEX> and health-care <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX>--to supply the task
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> with facts and policy proposals. Magaziner divided the working <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> into
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> "cluster <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>" and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38</NUMEX> "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subgroups</ENAMEX>." The number of working<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">-group</ENAMEX> members
grew from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">100 to 630</TIMEX> .

            The task
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">force</ENAMEX> and working <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> conducted their proceedings in secret. Soon after the
working <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> convened, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Association of Physicians</ENAMEX> and Surgeons
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inc.</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>-ethics <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">watchdogs</ENAMEX> filed suit, arguing that the closed
meetings violated the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Advisory Committee</ENAMEX> Act of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1972</TIMEX> . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FACA</ENAMEX>,
designed to check the power and proliferation of presidential commissions,
requires that the meetings of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">working groups</ENAMEX> appointed by the executive branch
be open to the public. However, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FACA</ENAMEX> exempts <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committees</ENAMEX> consisting entirely of
federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AAPS</ENAMEX> argued that because <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary Clinton</ENAMEX> and other members
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">task force</ENAMEX> and working <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> were not federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>, the meetings
should be open. (Later, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX> ruled the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">first lady</ENAMEX> should be treated as a
federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX>.)

            
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judges</ENAMEX> routinely criticize <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FACA</ENAMEX> as ambiguous
and overreaching . The law even fails to define "government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX>" and
does not specify what constitutes "membership" on an advisory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX>. Responding
to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FACA</ENAMEX>'s ambiguities, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX> have whittled down the law. For instance,
fact-finding panels that don't propose policy have been exempted. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> has
further limited its scope, passing amendments that exclude from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FACA</ENAMEX> an
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Bar Association</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committee</ENAMEX> that rates the qualifications of judicial
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nominees</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Academy of Science</ENAMEX>, and other
lesser-known panels. But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX> have also upheld it. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1983</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reagan</ENAMEX>
administration beat back a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FACA</ENAMEX> suit to make public the meetings of an advisory
panel of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">CEOs</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AAPS</ENAMEX>'s
request for a temporary injunction against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s health-care <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">task force</ENAMEX> was
rejected by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</ENAMEX> in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>, which concluded that more information was needed to determine whether the
working <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> qualified for a FACA exemption. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinton</ENAMEX>
administration abandoned the health-care initiative and released all
documents from the working <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>.

            On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Dec. 21, 1994</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lamberth</ENAMEX> dismissed the suit against the
government, but he asked <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Attorney</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eric Holder</ENAMEX> (now deputy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">general</ENAMEX>) to investigate whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Magaziner</ENAMEX> should be held in criminal
contempt for supplying false information in his affidavit, filed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 3</TIMEX>,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>. The investigation turned on a single sentence in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Magaziner</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>,
"Only federal government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> serve as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the interdepartmental
working <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>." <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lamberth</ENAMEX> insisted that this sentence contradicted indisputable
evidence that private <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> attended the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">working groups</ENAMEX>, and that some of
them played supervisory roles. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> was especially irritated by the
presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> from managed-care <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">conglomerates</ENAMEX> who stood to profit from
the new legislation--exactly the sort of conflict of interest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FACA</ENAMEX> was intended
to check. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lamberth</ENAMEX> says that the appeals <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> took at face value
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Magaziner</ENAMEX>'s "only federal government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>" declaration when it ruled
against the request for a temporary injunction.

            Although
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Holder</ENAMEX> chided government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> for formulating a "sloppy," "overly
aggressive" response to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AAPS</ENAMEX> lawsuit and took <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Magaziner</ENAMEX> to task for using
ill-defined legalistic language supplied him by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counsel</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vincent</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Foster</ENAMEX>, he concluded his investigation by declining to prosecute
Magaziner for criminal contempt. He found no factual errors in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Magaziner</ENAMEX>'s
affidavit, and no evidence that he had intended to willfully mislead the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX>.
Indeed, deep into the affidavit, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Magaziner</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">volunteers</ENAMEX> the information that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultants</ENAMEX> who were clearly not government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> played a prominent role
in the working <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. Charges of criminal contempt hinge upon proving beyond a
reasonable doubt that there was an intention to deceive, and even
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lamberth</ENAMEX> accepts that such proof is unattainable. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Holder</ENAMEX> also acknowledged that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Magaziner</ENAMEX>'s much-contested one-sentence statement was not an important element
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FACA</ENAMEX> defense. Unlike recent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX>
investigations of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holder's</ENAMEX> earned near universal acclaim. Even
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Lamberth</ENAMEX> deemed it "commendable" in his ruling <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last month</TIMEX>.

            
Yet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lamberth</ENAMEX> still believes that Magaziner
deliberately misled the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> and that government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> acted in "bad
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">faith</ENAMEX>," and he maintains that the appeals <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> might have issued an injunction
against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">task force</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">working groups</ENAMEX> if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Magaziner</ENAMEX> had not made his
now-famous one-sentence declaration. He writes, "The most outrageous conduct by
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> in this case is what happened when it never corrected or updated
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Magaziner</ENAMEX> declaration."

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>'s lawyers
suspect that the real source of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lamberth</ENAMEX>'s ire is not the sloppy sentence in an
affidavit but the government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX>' hardball tactics and unwillingness to
compromise, which drew the case out for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four years</TIMEX> .
