            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">This week</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX>
ordered the opening of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Arlington National Cemetery's Tomb of the Unknowns to</ENAMEX>
remove the remains of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldier</ENAMEX> killed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Vietnam War</ENAMEX> and submit them to
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> tests to recover his identity. This is the latest in a spate of
high-profile exhumations. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Celebrities exhumed</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1990s</TIMEX> include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Czar</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nicholas II</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">outlaw</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesse James</ENAMEX>, civil rights <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">martyr</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Medgar Evers</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zachary Taylor</ENAMEX>. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">historians</ENAMEX> carp that conspiracy-minded publicity
hounds perpetuate this fad, rudely disturbing the dead. How do exhumations
work? What do religion and law have to say about them? Why do we now have so
many?

            Since the
1920s, it has been standard practice for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> morticians to embalm <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">corpses</ENAMEX>,
to disinfect them so decomposition is delayed. (For a cross-cultural study of
embalming techniques, click .) Even with most embalmed bodies, however, the
flesh eventually dehydrates and crumbles and is devoured by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>. (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">One</ENAMEX>
alleged origin of "ghost stories": Several breeds of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>, especially wood
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fungi</ENAMEX>, which feast on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">corpses</ENAMEX>, are luminous in the dark.) The longevity of a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cadaver</ENAMEX>'s flesh and innards depends largely on the embalming, the casket
(hermetic ones preserve better), the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">decedent</ENAMEX>'s diet (certain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> thrive
on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fat</ENAMEX>), and the warmth of the ground (a good freeze kills off <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>).

            Here are the most common reasons for exhumation : DNA
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">extractions</ENAMEX> to settle paternity suits; criminal investigations; relocation to
familial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cemetery plots</ENAMEX>; and accidental discoveries--e.g., when a construction
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker stumbles</ENAMEX> across an unmarked grave.

            Attitudes
toward exhumation vary wildly. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Native American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tribes</ENAMEX> assert the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>'s
spirit lives on and that to disturb a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">corpse</ENAMEX> is to disturb the spirit's life.
Both <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslims</ENAMEX> take nearly as strong positions against
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">disinterment</ENAMEX>. By tradition, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> require funerals to take place within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX>
of death, with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the community keeping vigil over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> until it
goes in the ground. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Exhumation</ENAMEX> is allowed only when a body is to be reburied
with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> or in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christians</ENAMEX> have a more liberal exhumation policy. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catholic</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Protestant</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX> say <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> shouldn't be disturbed, if
possible. However, upon canonization, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">saints</ENAMEX> have frequently been disinterred
so their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">remains</ENAMEX> can be dismembered and turned into relics. And in the past,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">exhumation</ENAMEX> has been ex post facto punishment for heresies. The classic
example is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">corpse</ENAMEX> of the corrupt <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pope Formosus</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">816-896</ENAMEX>), which was exhumed
and dragged through the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX>. (Although his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">remains</ENAMEX> were reburied,
subsequent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">popes</ENAMEX> had <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Formosus</ENAMEX>' body disinterred and further mutilated.)

            
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> laws governing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exhumation</ENAMEX> remain vague
and disparate , varying from state to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. Most state regulations derive
from <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> common law. Oddly, the common law prohibits the theft of items
from a grave--shrouds, clothing, etc.--but is silent on the theft or removal of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> themselves. This was a matter left to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>. (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Only</NUMEX> in the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-19 th century</TIMEX>, when snatching <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">corpses</ENAMEX> for medical experiments
became endemic, did states pass laws prohibiting cadaver theft.) Generally,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> can apply to their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney general</ENAMEX> for permission to exhume
family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> for any reason, and requests for reburial are usually
automatically granted. And the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> can exhume a body when it deems a death
suspicious and improperly investigated. Many questions--what if <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> members
disagree on exhumation, and what if the dead <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> has no <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX>?--remain
to be hashed out in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX>.

            
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Pathologists</ENAMEX> say the number of exhumations skyrocketed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1980s</TIMEX> and
then increased even more in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the '90s</TIMEX>. Click for a list of recent and proposed
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">celebrity exhumations</ENAMEX>. Why the trend?

            

               <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">1 Scientific Advances: Forensic</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pathology</ENAMEX>, the use of science to solve crime, has improved dramatically,
particularly with the development of new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> tests. Until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> tests
required fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> from very specific body parts--e.g., strands of hair
that include roots--that tend to decay quickly. Now, virtually any remaining
body part--a bone, a tooth--will do. The difference: Where old <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> tests
required a sample from the nucleus of a cell, the new tests work off sturdier
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mitochondria</ENAMEX>--the energy-producing material that surrounds a nucleus. Although
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> considers mitochondrial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> tests virtually infallible, many
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">anthropologists</ENAMEX> doubt their accuracy. (In the case of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Unknown Soldier</ENAMEX>, DNA
for his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">remains</ENAMEX> will be matched against <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> from the blood of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> the
military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">suspects</ENAMEX> are related to him.)

            Other new
techniques include the use of computer animation to construct images of faces,
based on surviving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">jawbones</ENAMEX> and teeth, as well as information gleaned from DNA
about hair color. Previously, dental records had been the primary means of
identifying unknown cadavers. (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Forensic</ENAMEX> legend has <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Revere</ENAMEX> first utilizing
this technique during the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Revolutionary War</ENAMEX>.)

            

               <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2 Transitions</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Democracy</ENAMEX>: With the
collapse of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">dictatorships</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early '90s</TIMEX>, human rights
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> tracked down mass graves containing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regimes</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chile</ENAMEX>,
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 900</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> of ex-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dictator</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Augusto Pinochet</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX> have been dug up
and identified. Confronted with evidence of mass graves, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pinochet</ENAMEX> remarked that
they represented a "great savings of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cemetery space</ENAMEX>." Similar exhumations of
mass graves in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bosnia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rwanda</ENAMEX> are intended to obtain evidence that will
convict war <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">criminals</ENAMEX>.

            In
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eastern Europe</ENAMEX>, exhumed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> have been used as symbols by political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parties</ENAMEX>,
as anthropologist <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Katherine Verdery</ENAMEX> explains in her forthcoming book, The
Political <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Lives of Dead Bodies in the Postsocialist Transformation</ENAMEX> . For
instance, liberal reform <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> have disinterred <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Communist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> from their
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mausoleums</ENAMEX> while reburying <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">pre-Communist</ENAMEX> nationalist <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heroes</ENAMEX> in elaborate
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sarcophagi</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Serbia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Slobodan Milosevic</ENAMEX> sanctioned the removal in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</TIMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Serbian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hero Czar</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lazar</ENAMEX>, killed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">600 years before</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turks</ENAMEX>
at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Battle</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kosovo</ENAMEX>, so it could be paraded around <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Slovenia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Croatia</ENAMEX> in
a display of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Serb</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">power</ENAMEX>.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3 Claims of Conspiracy</ENAMEX>: Many recent and proposed
exhumations have sought to prove that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elites</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">historians</ENAMEX> have conspired to
withhold the truth about murders and assassinations. Was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ron Brown</ENAMEX> murdered? Is
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee Harvey Oswald</ENAMEX> in his grave or in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX>? Did <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Meriwether Lewis</ENAMEX> really commit
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">suicide</ENAMEX>, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">historians</ENAMEX> claim? It's conceivable that some of these allegations
are true, and there's no harm in checking them out, as long as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">decedent</ENAMEX>'s
family agrees to participate. But these sorts of exhumations have a track
record of turning up nothing. An exhumation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee Harvey Oswald</ENAMEX>'s grave found
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee Harvey Oswald</ENAMEX>.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4 Corpse Fetish</ENAMEX>: Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">anthropologists</ENAMEX> say the
technology is new but the impulse is old. We are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heirs</ENAMEX> to the inexplicable
pagan obsession with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">corpses</ENAMEX>.
