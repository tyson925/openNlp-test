            A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hawaii</ENAMEX> ruled this
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week</TIMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>'s constitutional prohibition against sex discrimination
requires it to give legal sanction to same-sex marriages. Although state
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> plan to appeal the decision to the state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX>'s
decision has revived the controversy that prompted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> to pass (and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> to sign) the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Marriage Act</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September</TIMEX>. That act
defines marriage for the purposes of federal law as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">union</ENAMEX> of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> and a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">woman</ENAMEX> (thereby denying federal spousal benefits to same-sex <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partners</ENAMEX>) and
permits <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> to deny recognition to same-sex marriages performed in other
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>.

            While it
is true that a large part of the debate over same-sex marriage has focused on
the moral and religious issues, marriage is also a legal condition with
practical consequences. What advantages--and disadvantages--would become
available to same-sex <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unions</ENAMEX> if they were officially recognized by the
government?

            The federal tax code , as well as many state tax
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX>, favors marriages in which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spouse</ENAMEX> earns most of or all the income,
and penalizes those in which income is equally or nearly equally split between
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partners</ENAMEX>. The oft-complained-of "marriage penalty " only exists in
the latter case. If both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> have roughly equal incomes--which may be the
case more often among same-sex <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couples</ENAMEX> than among opposite-sex ones--getting
married will raise their taxes. But a working <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> who is the sole or main
support of a same-sex <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> could realize a large tax saving if the union
were legally sanctioned. This is especially so if they are approaching
retirement.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> 's
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">old-age</ENAMEX> and disability programs both favor married <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. For example, when a
fully <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">insured worker</ENAMEX> retires, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spouse</ENAMEX> receives <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX>'s
benefits. This is not the case with unmarried <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couples</ENAMEX>--which fact gives married
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> the edge over their unwed counterparts. (However, if each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> had
had substantial earnings, no marriage benefit would accrue--the law requires
the lower-earning <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> to choose between taking his or her own earned
benefit or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one-half</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partner</ENAMEX>'s benefit.) If only one <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> in a
same-sex marriage had substantial earnings, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> would realize a much
higher rate of return on that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> taxes than they would
have if unwed or earning comparable incomes.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social</ENAMEX>
Security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">survivor</ENAMEX> benefits --and spousal benefits under other federal
programs such as veterans' pensions --apply only to a legal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spouse</ENAMEX>, not
to an unmarried <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX>.

            
Though the law does not require that businesses
provide their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> with medical benefits , many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employers</ENAMEX> do so.
Benefits often cover <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>, and some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> now are extending
benefits to same-sex <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> as well. But benefits for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> and their
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> are tax-free. When <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX> offer benefits to unmarried <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partners</ENAMEX>,
however, the cost is taxable income. If same-sex <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> were legally
recognized as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spouses</ENAMEX>, the benefits would no longer be taxed.

            Marriage
also grants a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spouse</ENAMEX> automatic "medical power of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> "--the legal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">authority</ENAMEX> to make medical decisions for an incapacitated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>. Unmarried
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partners</ENAMEX>, of the same or opposite sex, must hire a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> to obtain this
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">authority</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Hospitals</ENAMEX> also generally bar those who are not <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s immediate family from intensive care <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> . The marriage
contract confers numerous rights to a surviving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spouse</ENAMEX> upon the death of
the other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spouse</ENAMEX>. This includes deciding how to dispose of the deceased's
body .

            Marriage also helps the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">survivor</ENAMEX> to inherit . In most
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spouse</ENAMEX> automatically inherits from a deceased <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX>. In the case of
unmarried <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couples</ENAMEX>, on the other hand, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">survivor</ENAMEX> is entitled to nothing
unless the deceased specifically wills it to him or her. When unmarried people
die intestate--without a will--their assets automatically go to their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>.
Because married <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are considered to be an economic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX>, moreover, the
federal estate tax exempts all assets inherited by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spouse</ENAMEX>. Unmarried
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> receive no such exemption. And where a surviving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spouse</ENAMEX> may sue for
wrongful death , or for his or her own emotional distress, if the death
is arguably someone else's fault (a traffic accident, for instance), an
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unmarried</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> generally has no such right.

            Some of
the most important legal consequences of marriage involve getting out of it
(even though it is true that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spouse</ENAMEX> generally cannot be required to
testify against the other in court as long as they're still married).
Divorce laws divide property and dictate the financial support of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spouses</ENAMEX> who did little work outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX>. These laws vary by state. But in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">general</ENAMEX>, when a marriage dissolves, each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> is considered to own
everything he/she brought into the marriage, while all assets obtained during
the marriage (except by inheritance) are considered joint property. What
happens to joint <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">property</ENAMEX>? Most <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> have "equitable distribution" laws,
under which it is supposed to be divided fairly, though not necessarily in
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>. Only <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> have "community property" laws requiring that all
assets acquired during a marriage be divided equally.

            
A same-sex <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spouse</ENAMEX> probably couldn't count on
any long-term alimony . Since the "no-fault" divorce reforms of the
1970s, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX> have rarely made such awards in cases involving the dissolution
of marriage. Instead, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX> give the financially dependent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spouse</ENAMEX>
"maintenance" payments, which provide support while she or he gains a footing
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">work force</ENAMEX>. In practical terms, maintenance usually lasts <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">only five to</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven years</TIMEX>, and rarely longer than the marriage did.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
immigration law permits <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spouses</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> to become <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> with only a few exceptions, such as sham marriages undertaken for the
purpose of obtaining <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizenship</ENAMEX>. Although there are still some legal hoops to
jump through, marriage would enable the same-sex <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> of a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizen</ENAMEX> to
avoid the very lengthy (and frequently unsuccessful) application process for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">citizenship</ENAMEX>.

            Aprimary argument against same-sex marriage is that
marriage is an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX> for the raising of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>. But laws pertaining to
child-rearing are surprisingly marriage-neutral. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Parents</ENAMEX> have the same
obligations to support their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> regardless of whether they are, or ever
were, married to each other. (And marriage benefits go to all married people
regardless of whether they have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>.) Same-sex marriage would have no
direct effect on the rights and obligations of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">parenthood</ENAMEX>. It might well,
however, facilitate gay <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couples</ENAMEX>' efforts to adopt <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>.

            The marriage contract pours a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sea</ENAMEX> of benefits and obligations into a single "I do." As a generic set of laws
for an extraordinarily diverse <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of marriages, marriage law burdens some
couples some of the time and benefits most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couples</ENAMEX> most of the time. Symbolism
aside, if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> extended marriage to same-sex <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couples</ENAMEX>, the new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spouses</ENAMEX>
would find the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pros</ENAMEX> and cons about the same.
