            Virtually every type of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">commerce</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> is subject to some form of taxation at the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">federal</ENAMEX>, state, or local level. The Internet industry (made up of Internet
service <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX> and online service <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX> along with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> that do
business over the Internet) is no exception. Yet the fast growth of
electronic commerce , and the novel properties of the industry, pose
special problems for tax <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX>.

            The
federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> worries that the Internet could become a global haven for
money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">launderers</ENAMEX> and tax <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">evaders</ENAMEX> . <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX> and localities worry that
increasing use of the Internet will erode their tax <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses shop</ENAMEX> and do business outside of their taxing jurisdictions. While
they are anxious to develop more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of revenue and expand their tax <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX>,
they also realize that unilateral efforts to collect from the industry may
simply drive the easily moved online operations over the state line. Not
surprisingly, the Internet industry opposes any new taxes on its burgeoning
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">commerce</ENAMEX>. Major online <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">retailers</ENAMEX> and service <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX>, however, recognize that
there is no case for exempting Internet sales and, perhaps, services from the
same tax laws that apply to offline commerce. But they are especially concerned
with developing uniform, consistent, and fair tax treatment by state and local
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX>. Multiple taxation is seen as a particular threat.

            Who has responsibility for taxing Internet commerce?
As the Internet grows and changes, how is existing tax law being applied? What
can and should be taxed--goods and services sold over the Internet? Online
services themselves? And by what level(s) of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>? These taxing questions
are likely to keep <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">accountants</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX>, and international-trade <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultants</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMWs</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>.

            Estimated
revenues from the Internet are not huge--so far. But predictions of where
they're going are very big. According to industry research, subscription and
advertising revenues from Internet and online services were <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as much as $2.2</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">billion</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX> and may top <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$14 billion</NUMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year 2000</TIMEX>. Advertising revenues
alone made up <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$131 million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX>, but not surprisingly, this represented
less than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.5 percent</NUMEX> of the ad money spent on other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX>.

            
Online sales of products over the Internet
amounted to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">approximately $500 million</NUMEX>, less than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.4 percent</NUMEX> of all mail-order
sales. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Forrester Research</ENAMEX> predicts this number will reach <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$6.6 billion</NUMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>,
but that would still amount to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 5 percent</NUMEX> of all predicted mail-order
sales. But as more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> become familiar with online commerce, they may
very well begin to shop for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">products</ENAMEX> over the Internet precisely to avoid
state and local sales taxes .

            Taxing
online sales of mailed products is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> obvious revenue opportunity under
existing tax law. The easy analogy here is to catalog sales (although these,
too, have posed problems for state and local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX>). If you buy a pair of
boots from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L.L. Bean</ENAMEX>'s catalog, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> must charge you sales tax if you
live in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maine</ENAMEX> (or any other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>), where it maintains a place of business. By
the same token, if you decide to use your computer to buy, say, a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">five-liter</NUMEX>
bottle of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1984</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Napa Valley</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cabernet</ENAMEX> (for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$629</NUMEX>) from <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Virtual Vineyard</ENAMEX>, the same
rule applies. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Virtual Vineyard</ENAMEX>'s location (or "nexus" in tax-speak) is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Palo</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alto</ENAMEX>, so, unless you're having the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> sent to a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> address, there
will be no sales tax.

            But the situation is different in practice (if not
principle) in the case of products delivered over the Internet .
Establishing nexus can be a tricky issue, for example, when it's a case of
content--such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazines</ENAMEX>, books, videos, music, or computer
software--being downloaded. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">seller</ENAMEX> may have no idea of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">buyer</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">location</ENAMEX>, and hence whether sales tax is due (though new software packages
being developed for online commerce may help remedy this). But the location of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">seller</ENAMEX> may be even tougher to determine.

            As noted
above, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">seller</ENAMEX> must collect sales tax from a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">buyer</ENAMEX> if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">seller</ENAMEX> has a
significant "physical presence " in the same jurisdiction where the buyer
takes delivery. Suppose, for example, that the content in question is being
sold by an online <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">service</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">America Online</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft Network</ENAMEX>,
or any of a myriad of smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">services</ENAMEX>. Where does that service do business?
Most online service <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX> operate <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Point</ENAMEX>-of-Presence (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">POP</ENAMEX>) locations that
allow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subscribers</ENAMEX> to log on to the Internet using a local phone number. These
typically consist of a leased <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> with modems and routing equipment. Already,
some <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> have argued that POPs constitute sufficient physical presence for
taxing purposes. But the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Supreme Court</ENAMEX> case <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quill</ENAMEX> vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dakota</ENAMEX> would seem to defeat such an argument. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quill</ENAMEX> ruling protects
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sellers</ENAMEX> of tangible personal property from state taxation if their contacts
within the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> are limited to mail-order catalogs, telephone, or the
Internet.

            
And what if the content is being sold by a
separate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendor</ENAMEX> through an online service? Some <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> argue that
taxable nexus can be established if a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendor</ENAMEX> operates over an online or
Internet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">service</ENAMEX> with substantial physical presence within the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. This
opens up a whole new basis for taxation opposed by the industry and unlikely to
be upheld by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX>. After all, to return to our catalog analogy, if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L.L.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bean</ENAMEX> uses <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UPS</ENAMEX> to deliver its boots, that doesn't expose the sale to taxation in
every <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UPS</ENAMEX> operates. And even if <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> can win the nexus argument
in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX>, Internet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX> are likely to flee to more tax-friendly
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">jurisdictions</ENAMEX>, thus forcing (angry) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subscribers</ENAMEX> to incur long-distance phone
charges for online access.

            In
addition to sales taxes, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> also impose some form of tax on Internet
and online services or activities. These include <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Connecticut</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Massachusetts</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nebraska</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tennessee</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> are doing the
same. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Officials</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fort</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Collins</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colo.</ENAMEX>, decided <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> that Internet
providers were subject to a city sales tax on telephone service and that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subscribers</ENAMEX> would have to pay a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3 percent</NUMEX> sales tax on top of their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</TIMEX>
access fee. The industry argues that it is not comparable to the (heavily
taxed) telecommunications industry, and that such efforts result in double
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">taxation</ENAMEX>--since service <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX> already pay taxes on phone-line usage--as
well as for Internet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendors</ENAMEX>. Again, as in the case of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> sales, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> have
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">taxing</ENAMEX> jurisdiction over transactions only if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">seller</ENAMEX> has sufficient
physical presence in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>.

            Tax <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> are further threatened by the growing use
of electronic money . E-cash can be used to facilitate a host of illegal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> transactions, thereby eliminating the need for
suitcases full of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$100</NUMEX> bills. It could also swell the underground economy, as
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> use it to pay for services, facilitating the avoidance of federal income
tax.

            Another dicey issue
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">confronting Treasury Department</ENAMEX> enforcement <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> is Internet
gambling . Although federal law prohibits gambling by wire in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX>, and most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> interpret that to mean that Internet gambling is
illegal here, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> online <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">casino</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Casino Royale</ENAMEX>, looks and feels like a
virtual gambling emporium. (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jon Kyl</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ariz.</ENAMEX>, has just introduced a bill
to ban online gambling.)

            
Recognizing that the Internet effectively wipes out national borders, and
fearing that the development of new technologies may be impeded by inconsistent
tax policies, the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> has been studying the issue of
international tariffs on Internet transactions. At this point, no
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> have imposed tariffs or other taxes on online commerce, but at least
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a dozen</NUMEX> are considering them. This is a big area of concern for the
administration, since the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> exports <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$40 billion</NUMEX> in services
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">annually</ENAMEX>, including software, entertainment and information products, and
professional services.

            
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>'s position is
that the Internet should be a federal duty-free zone. In releasing a draft
report on the subject, Deputy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawrence Summers</ENAMEX> said, "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">We</ENAMEX>
absolutely reject the idea that the Internet is some sort of golden <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">goose</ENAMEX> whose
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">feathers</ENAMEX> should be taxed. The key message of the report is no Internet taxes."
This does not mean, however, that the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> supports abolition of
any taxes on Internet commerce, only that it plans no new taxes at this
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> report itself stresses that, in principle, the tax code
should treat Internet transactions exactly like other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels of commerce</ENAMEX>.

            On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 13</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ron Wyden</ENAMEX>,
D-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ore.</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher Cox</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Calif.</ENAMEX>, introduced the Internet Tax
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Freedom Act</ENAMEX> . The bill would impose an indefinite moratorium on state and
local taxes on electronic commerce, though it would exempt certain taxes,
including most sales taxes, that are already in place. The bill also calls on
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> to develop a comprehensive plan to address the issue, and to
seek bilateral and multilateral trade agreements that make all Internet
activity internationally free of taxes, tariffs, and trade barriers.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> is
already working with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Trade Organization</ENAMEX> and other
international trade <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> on uniform rules for taxation of electronic
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">commerce</ENAMEX>. Meanwhile, there are tricky aspects to assessing taxes under current
international tax treaties, including: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) identifying the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> or countries
with authority to tax; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) classifying the type of income arising from the
transaction (e.g., royalties, sales of goods, or services); <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) tracing
transactions handled with electronic money; and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) identifying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> to
transactions, and verifying records. In addition, some <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> impose
quotas on content such as books, movies, music, and software from
abroad, but the origin of that content can be tough to trace in the thin air of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cyberspace</ENAMEX>.
