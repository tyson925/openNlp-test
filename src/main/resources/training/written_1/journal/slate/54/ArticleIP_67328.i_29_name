                (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">th Century Fox Film</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corp.</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Critics</ENAMEX> bemoan the absence of songs in this latest film depiction of
the romance between <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">widow</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anna Leonowens</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mongkut</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Siam</ENAMEX>,
familiar to most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewers</ENAMEX> through the musical The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">King</ENAMEX> and I . Critics
contend that leads <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jodie Foster</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Chow Yun-Fat</ENAMEX> have weak chemistry and that
the film is "a luxuriant, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">lumbering behemoth ‚Ä¶ pleasant</ENAMEX>, occasionally
amusing--and often dull" (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andy Seiler</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA Today</ENAMEX> ). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger Ebert</ENAMEX> gives a
surprisingly harsh review: "It is an exotic escapist entertainment for matinee
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ladies</ENAMEX>, who can fantasize about sex with that intriguing bald <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">monster</ENAMEX> and
indulge their harem fantasies" (the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicago Sun-Times</ENAMEX> ). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jay Carr</ENAMEX> of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boston Globe</ENAMEX> dissents from the pack, calling the film "a lot more than
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">King</ENAMEX> and I minus <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rodgers</ENAMEX>'s and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hammerstein</ENAMEX>'s music. It's a broader,
wider, deeper, fuller canvas." (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Click</ENAMEX> here for more on the real <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mongkut</ENAMEX>.)

                (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buena Vista Pictures</ENAMEX>). When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robin</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Williams</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chris</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Columbus</ENAMEX> last teamed up, on Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Doubtfire</ENAMEX> ,
they scored. This time they do not. Based on a short story by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isaac Asimov</ENAMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">film</ENAMEX> follows an android that slowly gains human qualities and ends up as "a
cornball drone of greeting-card sentiment" (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger Ebert</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicago</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sun-Times</ENAMEX> ). The beginning scenes--when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Williams</ENAMEX> plays a non-human--are the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">film</ENAMEX>'s highpoint: "[<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>]he sad fact is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Williams</ENAMEX> is at his best while trapped in
[the robot's] original sleek form. His performance is subtle, his reactions
restrained. The more <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robin</ENAMEX> is exposed, the more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ham</ENAMEX> is served." Eventually the
film degenerates into "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Patch Android</ENAMEX> " (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Susan Wloszczyna</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> ). (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Click</ENAMEX> here for more on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asimov</ENAMEX>.)

                (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Miramax</ENAMEX>). Decent notices for
the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> film adaptation of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Irving</ENAMEX> novel for which he's deigned to
write the screenplay. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lasse Halstr√∂m</ENAMEX> ( What's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eating Gilbert Grape</ENAMEX> )
directs. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA Today</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike Clark</ENAMEX> calls the coming-of-age story set at an
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">orphanage</ENAMEX> in 1940s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maine</ENAMEX> "passive but passable." <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Caine</ENAMEX>'s turn as the
benign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of the orphanage (a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> addicted to ether) is excellent, but
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tobey Maguire</ENAMEX>, playing the orphan <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Caine</ENAMEX> takes under his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX> and grooms to be
his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">successor</ENAMEX>, is too deadpan for most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX>. A few praise the film's
understated pleasures: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Corliss</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> calls it "a small epic
with subtle strengths." (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Click</ENAMEX> here to find out more about the book the film is based

                  Mailer: A Biography

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mifflin</ENAMEX>). This unauthorized biography of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>'s feistiest
contemporary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> and public figures draws excellent reviews. Dearborn casts
a cool eye on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mailer</ENAMEX>'s attention-getting tactics (he suggested that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vietnam</ENAMEX> should only kill <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> they were willing to eat), his drunken
outbursts, his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>-stabbing episode, and delivers what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> agree is an
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">evenhanded</ENAMEX>, engrossing, "crisply written" (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sven Birkerts</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Esquire</ENAMEX> ) book
that will prove difficult for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mailer</ENAMEX>'s official <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biographer</ENAMEX> to follow. One
complaint: <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dearborn</ENAMEX> "prefers to get <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mailer</ENAMEX>'s contradictions and irrationalities
onto the page as story" instead of exploring the meanings behind them, and she
"likes to knock the stuffing out of [<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Mailer</ENAMEX>] when she finds him too
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">upholstered</ENAMEX>" (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Caleb Crain</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times Book Review</ENAMEX> ). (The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New</ENAMEX>

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nadia Benabid</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arcade</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Critics</ENAMEX> heap praise on <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cuban</ENAMEX>-born <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vald√</ENAMEX>©s' <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> novel:
The "rambunctious new novel is an appetizingly rich <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stew</ENAMEX>, full of the varied
flavors of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> culture <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Ä¶ sumptuous ‚Ä¶exuberantly</ENAMEX> translated" (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anderson Tepper</ENAMEX>,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times Book Review</ENAMEX> ). Spanning <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50 years</TIMEX> in the life of a
country <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> who moves to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Havana</ENAMEX>, the book is "a messy, passionate indictment
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fidel Castro</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX>, packed with grotesque caricatures, implausible crises
and generous dollops of magic realism" (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gabriella Stern</ENAMEX>, the Wall Street

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rolling Stone</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Times</ENAMEX> , and just about everyone in
between adore <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beck</ENAMEX>'s tribute to '70s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">funk</ENAMEX> (with countless '90s styles including
hip-hop and country mixed in). Beck nails the highbrow vote, with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Luc Sante</ENAMEX>'s
Village <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Voice</ENAMEX> musing that the music has "a texture and effect that is
not far from that of the hand-painted non-collages of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Rosenquist</ENAMEX>," as
well as the lowbrow vote: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA Today</ENAMEX> says it "radiates party vibes" (Edna
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gundersen</ENAMEX>). Other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> rave that "<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">track</ENAMEX> after another leaps out at you
until you've got <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> new favorite songs" (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Gates</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek</ENAMEX> ), and
that it's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>'s "most relentless <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX>--laughing or otherwise--of a party album"
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chris Wilman, Entertainment Weekly</ENAMEX> ). One dissenter takes umbrage at
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beck</ENAMEX>'s heavy borrowing from black music: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike Jenkins</ENAMEX> writes in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> that the album "can't escape its minstrel-show
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">undercurrents</ENAMEX>" and that the album's genre-bending "stunts" sink Beck "deeper in
stylistic debt than he can ever repay." (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Click</ENAMEX> here to listen to clips from the album.)

Little

the family <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>, voiced by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nathan Lane</ENAMEX>, whose wisecracking barely keeps this
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adaptation of the E.B.</ENAMEX> White <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>'s classic from becoming intolerable.
Apparently "it's easier to make a mouse talk than to come up with something
