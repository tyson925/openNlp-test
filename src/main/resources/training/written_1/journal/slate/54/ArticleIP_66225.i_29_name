               The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Human Decoder Ring</ENAMEX>
Chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX> has been almost completely decoded by an
international <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX>. As reported in a recent issue of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nature</ENAMEX> , the very first sequenced chromosome may offer new insights into
many human diseases, including <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">schizophrenia</ENAMEX>. (The human species has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX> pairs
of chromosomes.) The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX>, who hail from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Zealand</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sweden</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, discovered that <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chromosome 22</ENAMEX> contains
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33.4 million</NUMEX> different letters of genetic code and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 545</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. Thanks
to the Internet, the data has reached other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> around the world, many
of whom are using it in their own studies.

            The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> of mass communication, advertising, and public
relations at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boston</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University</ENAMEX> stepped down from his administrative post after being accused of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">plagiarism</ENAMEX>. In a lecture delivered to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</NUMEX> undergraduates, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Schulz</ENAMEX> used a
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">64</NUMEX>-word sentence from a recent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nation</ENAMEX> article by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander Stille</ENAMEX>
without attribution. The line was identified by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX>, who publicized the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transgression</ENAMEX> in an Internet chat <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> and sent a letter to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">communications</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dean</ENAMEX>. According to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boston Globe</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schulz</ENAMEX> says that he
didn't give the proper citation for the quote because he was pressed for time.
Still, he insists that his "ethical lapse" must be punished.

that the program was designed for other contingencies, such as bad weather. But
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Milwaukee Journal</ENAMEX> Sentinel disputed this, publishing a story headlined "College preparing for worst from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Y2K</TIMEX>." <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wisconsin</ENAMEX>
state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senator</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Jauch</ENAMEX> denounced the planning as "nutty behavior that isn't
fitting of a public <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX>."

            Last
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Duke University</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professors</ENAMEX> debated the value of studying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eastern</ENAMEX> cultures instead
of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Western</ENAMEX> ones when a call was made to establish a new curricular
concentration in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hindi</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Editors</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Duke</ENAMEX> 
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Review</ENAMEX> , a
conservative campus periodical, avowed that Western values are "superior to the
values of a primitive, impoverished <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>." Now that the academic
concentration has been approved, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anand Shah</ENAMEX>, co-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diya</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Duke</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Asian</ENAMEX>
student <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>, told the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Raleigh News and Observer</ENAMEX> , "I don't
foresee further debate about the issue." But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jay Strader</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Duke</ENAMEX>

               Review complained, "This is another example of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Duke administrators</ENAMEX>
bowing to the interests of special-interest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>."

               <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lawyer</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYU</ENAMEX>'s assistance was appreciated because

            The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Chicago</ENAMEX>
has chosen a new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>--but the debate over the ongoing shake-up at the
school continues. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Don Michael Randel</ENAMEX>, currently <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">provost</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cornell University</ENAMEX>,
has been selected to succeed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hugo Sonnenschein</ENAMEX>, who stepped down in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sonnenschein</ENAMEX> had --increasing enrollment, scaling back the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>'s "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Great</ENAMEX>
Books" core curriculum, reducing overall stuffiness--changes that many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alumni</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">faculty</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> feared would compromise the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>'s identity. The New
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">York Times</ENAMEX> notes that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">musicologist</ENAMEX> is expected to continue
with the former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>'s plans, though in a more harmonious manner.

            For

<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Cruz</ENAMEX> have been able to ask their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professors</ENAMEX> for written
evaluations instead of the standard grades. But in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November 170</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">faculty</ENAMEX> members
asked the academic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">senate</ENAMEX> to adopt a more conventional grading system. A vote
on the proposal by the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">588</NUMEX>-member <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">senate</ENAMEX> was postponed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early December</TIMEX> after
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly 1,000</NUMEX> grade-hating <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> showed up to protest the change, reports the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Associated Press</ENAMEX>.

            In
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early December</TIMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Princeton University</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> complained in an Internet discussion
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">forum</ENAMEX> that his religion thesis prep class was a waste of time, adding that one
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> agreed with him. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shaun E. Marmon</ENAMEX>, the professor
in question, says that she never agreed with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> and proceeded to post
a message suggesting that complaining <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> were lucky not to be in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marine Corps</ENAMEX> and quipped that it was true that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marines</ENAMEX> "do not shoot people
at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">dawn</TIMEX> anymore." The chair of the religion <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> told the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chronicle</ENAMEX> of
Higher Education that some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> were "a little agitated" by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX>'s message but added that no disciplinary action would be taken.

            The

them) call for a majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">faculty members</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trustees</ENAMEX> to be <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catholic</ENAMEX>, for
new <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catholic</ENAMEX> university <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">presidents</ENAMEX> to publicize their commitment to their

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York State</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Regents</ENAMEX>
have tightened admissions for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">applicants</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">City University of New</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">York</ENAMEX>. Incoming <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> who test poorly on math and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> placement tests
will no longer be allowed to attend <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CUNY</ENAMEX> while taking remedial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX> to
improve their skills. Instead, they'll be redirected to other institutions to
prepare them for college-level work. The measure will affect <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 percent</NUMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">applicants</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Supporters</ENAMEX> say the move will improve <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CUNY</ENAMEX>'s standing. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Critics</ENAMEX> worry
