            Who
says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indians</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pakistanis</ENAMEX> can't agree on anything? <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Newspapers</ENAMEX> in both
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> call the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>'s response to the hijacking of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indian</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Airlines</ENAMEX> Flight 814 "bungled and botched" (the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hindu of Madras</ENAMEX>) and a
"startling
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">muddle</ENAMEX>" ( <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Dawn</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indian Express</ENAMEX> said that "a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">one billion</NUMEX> ‚Ä¶ has become a sitting duck
for the masked <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">hand grenade</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AK-47</ENAMEX>."

            The
Times of
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> firmly opposed making a deal with the hijackers: "[<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>]<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ot</ENAMEX> just the
safety of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">160</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hostages</ENAMEX> but the future vulnerability of this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> to
terrorism" ride on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>'s negotiating strategy. "In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX>, an
ex-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prime minister</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aldo Moro</ENAMEX>, was not exchanged for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX> and his killing
by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Red Brigades</ENAMEX> turned the tide against terrorism in that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>," it
concluded. An op-ed by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sunanda K. Datta</ENAMEX>-Ray in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Herald</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tribune</ENAMEX> highlighted <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>'s dilemma: "<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> has to walk a delicate path
between capitulation to the hijackers and appearing callous about the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hostages</ENAMEX>.
Even if it had <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX>'s capability to mount an <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Entebbe</ENAMEX>-style commando rescue, a
bristly <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> would refuse overflight permission. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Taleban</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>, which <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> does not recognize, would also oppose any such <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX>
operation."

            
Looking to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>, where the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hostages</ENAMEX> are being held on an airstrip, an
editorial in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hindu</ENAMEX> concluded, "If the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX> wants to end its
international isolation and move towards a partial lifting of sanctions, it
must be seen playing a positive role in bringing this negotiation on its home
turf to a successful conclusion." In a story headlined "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Taliban</ENAMEX>'s image getting
a shine," the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">London Times</ENAMEX> pointed out that "the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX> have negotiated with the
hijackers, provided food and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> and welcomed
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> of several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX>--none of which recognize the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX>."

            

               Dawn denounced <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>'s reaction to the hijacking, charging that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indian</ENAMEX> media and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> are too busy demonizing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> to focus on the
causes and remedy of the crisis.

            In
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> said that the "bungling" of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pakistani</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> is "a potent reminder of the dangers of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Cold War</ENAMEX>-style
conflict dividing <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Asia</ENAMEX>." Whereas, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> speculated, a sensible
response to the hijacking might have been "to pool regional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> in
anti-terrorist measures which might either negotiate with the hijackers or
flush them out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX>," since <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> has "frayed diplomatic ties
with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> and none with the internationally shunned <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Taleban r√©gime ‚Ä</ENAMEX>¶
channels for coordinated action ‚Ä¶ did not exist."

            
Coverage of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alfonso Portillo</ENAMEX>'s landslide victory in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX>'s runoff to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guatemala</ENAMEX>'s general election seldom failed to mention the positive impact of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Portillo</ENAMEX>'s confession <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier this year</TIMEX> that in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1982</TIMEX> he killed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">rivals</ENAMEX> for
the deanship of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> law school where he was teaching. According to
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daily Telegraph</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Portillo</ENAMEX> was running a poor <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> to his rival
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">√ìscar Berger</ENAMEX> of incumbent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> √Ålvaro Arz√∫'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX>, before his admission.
After it, "his campaign took off and he never looked back." <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">El Pa√≠s</ENAMEX> said
that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Portillo</ENAMEX> promised <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Guatemalans</ENAMEX> "everything they wanted to hear ‚Ä¶ that he
wouldn't govern for the privileged, that he would combat <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">misery</ENAMEX> and violence,
that he would recognize the rights of the large <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mayan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, and that he
would be firm with the military <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">‚Ä¶</ENAMEX> and turn the judicial system upside
down."

            
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alberto Fujimori</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Peru</ENAMEX> announced <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> that since the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Peruvian</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Constitution</ENAMEX> was amended while he was in office, he has technically served only
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> term and is thus not subject to its two-term limit. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Rep√</ENAMEX>∫blica of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lima</ENAMEX>
greeted his announcement as "a new coup d'etat." An editorial in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> said
that "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fujimori</ENAMEX> has described himself as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">savior</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fatherland</ENAMEX>, sole
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guarantor</ENAMEX> of stability, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">guardian</ENAMEX> of the future, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">restorer</ENAMEX> of optimism. ‚Ä¶
Other than his self-description as an irreplaceable figure, the re-election
candidate offers nothing new." A union <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> quoted in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lima</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">El Comercio</ENAMEX> said,
"<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fujimori</ENAMEX> hasn't told the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> how he plans to solve the unemployment
problem, or the recession, or how to increase non-traditional exports. The most
worrying thing is that he hasn't shown how he's going to free <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Peru</ENAMEX> from
stagnation."

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">London Times</ENAMEX>
announced <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> that "the historic status of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greenwich</ENAMEX> as the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">home</ENAMEX> of time"
will be guaranteed by a plan to make it "the global timekeeper for the
Internet." Ignoring an existing campaign by watchmaker <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Swatch</ENAMEX> to divide the
Internet day into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,000</NUMEX> "beats" of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one minute 26.4 seconds</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Prime</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tony Blair</ENAMEX> and "e-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Minister</ENAMEX>" <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Patricia Hewitt</ENAMEX> are set to announce the
creation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Greenwich Electronic Time</ENAMEX>--GeT--as the international standard clock
for Internet <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX>. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Electronic Retailing</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Association</ENAMEX> told the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> , "It could have an advantage for consumers
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendors</ENAMEX>. Take, for example, a money-back guarantee. The time could vary by
several <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX>, depending on the point of purchase. Being able to have an
agreed-upon time could serve as good business practice."
