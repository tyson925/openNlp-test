               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Randy</ENAMEX>'s Wrap-Up
            

            Original Top <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>:

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) Thou shalt have no other gods before me.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven
image.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) Thou shalt not take the name of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lord thy</ENAMEX> God
in vain.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) Remember the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sabbath day</TIMEX>, to keep it holy.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>) Honor thy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> and thy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>) Thou shalt not kill.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>) Thou shalt not commit adultery.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>) Thou shalt not steal.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>) Thou shalt not bear false <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witness</ENAMEX>.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>) Thou shalt not
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">covet</ENAMEX>.

            It is striking how many of the commandments are
taken up with God's vanity. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> through <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>--<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40 percent</NUMEX> of the list--are just
me, me, me; God, God, God; I'm the best God; I'm No. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>; no pictures please, and
don't forget my special day. You'd think being God would give him some
confidence, but no; he goes on and on about himself. Despite his widespread
popularity--<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> do worship him--he's as jittery and insecure as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marilyn</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monroe</ENAMEX>.

            At least he could relax in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States of</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> as God-obsessed as any in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Middle Ages</TIMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Christian</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fundamentalists</ENAMEX> (our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX>) never shut up about his opposition to gay rights
and abortion or his enthusiasm for capital punishment, the flat tax, and an
anti-missile system to be built in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trent Lott</ENAMEX>'s district. It's a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> where
nearly everyone goes to church <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each week</TIMEX>, and nearly every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> flaunts
his involvement with God the way <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trump</ENAMEX> flaunts his with second-tier fashion
models.

            I've not actually seen
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lord</ENAMEX> in a clinical setting, but I've got to believe that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Prozac</ENAMEX> couldn't
hurt. At least it might keep him from acting out in such anti-social ways. Like
that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Venezuelan</ENAMEX> flood. Just trying to get attention, no matter how many people
get hurt.
