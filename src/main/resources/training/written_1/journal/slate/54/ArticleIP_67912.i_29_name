               The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indian Airlines</ENAMEX> hijackers dropped <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
demands. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> hijackers, who seized a jet <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX>, are still
demanding that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> release <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> Kashmiri militants, but they are no longer
asking for the return of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleague</ENAMEX>'s dead <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> or for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$200 million</NUMEX> in ransom.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>'s ruling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">faction</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> would be forced to leave
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> if a settlement is not reached soon. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> condemned
the hijacking (as did the 
                  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX>
               ), and each accused the other of
plotting it. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> differed as to whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concessions</ENAMEX> would make a
settlement more likely or increase the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hijackers</ENAMEX>' determination to achieve
their remaining demand. But most agreed that the incident is "a huge
blow" to prospects for peace talks between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>.

               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain</ENAMEX>'s and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fourth-quarter</TIMEX> fund raising equaled <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>'s and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">outpaced Gore</ENAMEX>'s. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX> raised <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$8 million</NUMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$4 million</NUMEX> between
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December</TIMEX>, bringing him within <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2 million</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year-end</TIMEX> total.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain</ENAMEX> raised <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$6 million</NUMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> pulled in <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$7 million</NUMEX> in the same period. The

                said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX> had
"translated their momentum in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Hampshire</ENAMEX> into a national money boost."
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain</ENAMEX> asserted that he'd become a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contender</ENAMEX>. But the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> camp said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain</ENAMEX>
wouldn't survive nationally, pointing to their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX>'s lead in total fund
raising (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$66 million to $16 million</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boosters</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> was
in trouble : "If <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> were as popular as he should be,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> wouldn't be writing checks to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Bradley</ENAMEX>." <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> countered that in any

there was no specific threat it was "impossible for federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> to rule
out the area as a terrorist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX>." International law enforcement has also

               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wen Ho Lee</ENAMEX> was denied bail. A federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> said his release

<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX>' spin: The evidence shows that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> was not arbitrarily singled out
for prosecution. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lee</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX>' spin: But the insinuations of spying are
based on "circumstantial
evidence, innuendo, or inference." Government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX>' counterspin: Even
so, the case against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> for security violations is airtight.

               <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> proposed to expand low-income rental subsidies. The
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$690 million</NUMEX> increase would add <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">120,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.7 million</NUMEX> currently
receiving the housing vouchers. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> said that expanding the program, which
covers <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">up to 70 percent</NUMEX> of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>'s rent, would particularly help <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) the

               The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vermont Supreme Court</ENAMEX> granted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gays</ENAMEX> greater partnership
