Wrap-Up
            

            Our week of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> quizzing continues, and in
the spirit of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the holidays</TIMEX> I'm giving the wrap-up to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tim Carvell</ENAMEX>, who might be
able to exchange it for something he really wants, if he saves the
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">receipt.</ENAMEX>-- R.C.
            

            "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Today</ENAMEX>'s question
reminds me of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> and only time I went to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Radio City Music Hall</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">Pageant</ENAMEX>, at which, among other things, they offer something called
the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Living Nativity</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rockettes</ENAMEX> dressed as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary</ENAMEX> hunker down in a
stable in the center of the stage, as more <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockettes</ENAMEX>, garbed as the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Wise Men</ENAMEX>,
lead <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">donkeys</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX>, camels, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sheep</ENAMEX>, and maybe some geese, onstage. Then they
all freeze perfectly still for, like, a minute, as the music swells and we are
presented with a shockingly good recreation of a kitsch <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nativity</ENAMEX> painting. At
which I was mightily impressed, but still troubled by one nagging thought:
Don't they have an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Easter</ENAMEX> show? And, if so, I hope that their major
show-stopper isn't what I think it is."-- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tim Carvell</ENAMEX>

Answer
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Contestants</ENAMEX> painted a new portrait of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus</ENAMEX>.

            Much the way the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> personifying <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Betty Crocker</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aunt Jemima</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia Pictures</ENAMEX> have been redesigned recently, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>
drew an updated <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus</ENAMEX>, logo of the popular religion Christianity.

            The winning portrait, "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX>," was
painted by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Janet McKenzie</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vermont</ENAMEX>, using an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African-American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> as her
model. It can be seen along with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">finalists</ENAMEX> at
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">natcath</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">org</ENAMEX>.

            The contest was judged
by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wendy Beckett</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> art <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critic</ENAMEX> and TV <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX>. She was
particularly impressed by the way neo-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus</ENAMEX> gazes at <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewers</ENAMEX> with "ineffable
dignity, with sadness but with confidence."

empty conjecture.
