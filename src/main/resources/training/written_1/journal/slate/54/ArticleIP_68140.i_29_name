            The
cover story celebrates the coming of world <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>. Political
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">globalization</ENAMEX> is catching up to economic globalization, as evidenced by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">multinational WTO</ENAMEX> protests in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Seattle</ENAMEX>. The new debate isn't over whether to
have world <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> but over what type of world <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> we should have. A
single planetary authority is unlikely; instead, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX> such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTO</ENAMEX>
will mediate international disputes and weaken national sovereignty. …
An essay blames the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX>'s ignorance of technology for its
Y2K <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doomsaying</ENAMEX>: "Maybe <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX> should hire a few more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nerds</ENAMEX>."

            A
column outlines the dangers of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Greenspan</ENAMEX>
cult. The blind worship of the fabulous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX>, who was just nominated
for another term, means that: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) if he does make a mistake it will be terribly
magnified; and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> are boosting stock prices to absurd levels because
they are relying on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspan</ENAMEX> to tell them when they've gone too far. …
A piece whacks <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>'s much-vaunted millennium
celebration as "low farce." The giant <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">Ferris</ENAMEX> wheel didn't work, the "river of
fire" was a dud, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Millennium Dome</ENAMEX> is disappointing. … The cover
editorial echoes the widespread opinion that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vladimir</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Putin</ENAMEX>'s career as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spy</ENAMEX> and bully bode ill for his presidency. (For

                  Slate
               's analysis of how <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Putin</ENAMEX> has tried to burnish his image, see
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Saletan</ENAMEX>'s ".")

            The
cover story marvels at the placebo effect and wonders whether we should allow
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> to prescribe placebos. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Sugar</ENAMEX> pills work in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35 percent to 75 percent</NUMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, and fake surgery can improve health as much as real surgery. The real
lesson of the placebo effect: When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> are attentive, confident, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">comforting</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> feel better--often regardless of how they are treated.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Placebos</ENAMEX> could be a bridge between the cold efficiency of modern medicine and
the unscientific comforts of alternative therapies. … An essay contends
that the flat tax will become a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21 st -century</TIMEX> cause because we live
in a "<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-click world." <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> want simplicity, even if the price is some
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unfairness</ENAMEX>. … An <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actress</ENAMEX> who has played in the traveling cast of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Cats</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 years</TIMEX> (!) is interviewed. She doesn't like <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX>.

            Very similar millennium
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">commemoratives</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> 's cover shot is <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Times Square</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek 's</ENAMEX> is
the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Eiffel Tower</ENAMEX>. Both run gobs of photos of celebrations around the world.
Here is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> 's. Both cheer the absence of
terrorism and computer catastrophe. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> 's cover wrap-up mentions the most peculiar <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">New Year</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX>: a
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> event where the Internet <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">millionaire host</ENAMEX> tried "to coordinate <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>
fornicating <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couples</ENAMEX> into simultaneous orgasms at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midnight</TIMEX>." …

               
                  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek</ENAMEX>
                says that minor <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Y2K</NUMEX> inconveniences may pile up
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the coming months</TIMEX>, especially among small businesses. It also warns that
many computers may crash on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Feb. 29</TIMEX>, a peculiar leap day. (Usually, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> that
end in "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">00</ENAMEX>" are not leap <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, but <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every 400 years</TIMEX>, they are. Got it?)

            A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek</ENAMEX>

               package on the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2.5 billion</NUMEX> self-help industry says
that female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby boomers</ENAMEX> are its leading <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX>. A social stigma is still
attached to most self-help programs: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen "Seven Habits" Covey</ENAMEX> is the only
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guru</ENAMEX> who has won mainstream respectability. … 
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boris</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yeltsin</ENAMEX> article reveals that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kremlin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">strategists</ENAMEX> had been plotting his
resignation for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nearly a year</TIMEX> to ensure the election of a loyal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">successor</ENAMEX>.
Acting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vladimir Putin</ENAMEX> is "more realist than ideologue." The former
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KGB</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> realizes corruption threatens <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX>'s economy, and unlike <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeltsin</ENAMEX>,
he is focused on his presidential duties. … In a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> 
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">remembrance</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Clinton</ENAMEX> claims <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeltsin</ENAMEX> "earned the right to
be called the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Father</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Russian Democracy</ENAMEX>."

            A book
review criticizes the new liberal wisdom that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> will be scarred for life
if their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">first three years</TIMEX> aren't stimulating. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Kids</ENAMEX> are extremely resilient,
and their emotional and intellectual development can be normal even if their
early childhoods are distressed. Only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> who suffer the most severe
deprivation are permanently damaged. … A piece lionizes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ed McBain</ENAMEX> (real
name: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Evan Hunter</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>'s first great <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cop novelist</ENAMEX>. For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40 years</TIMEX>, McBain
has been a lively and gritty chronicler of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York City</ENAMEX> life and helped
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">inspire</ENAMEX> TV <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cop</ENAMEX> shows such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Homicide</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYPD Blue</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hill</ENAMEX>
