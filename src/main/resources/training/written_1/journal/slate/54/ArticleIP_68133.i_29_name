               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Randy</ENAMEX>'s Wrap-Up
            

            Before plunging into TV <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>, let's take a moment
to look back at TV <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>, around <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midnight</TIMEX>.

            When the ball fell, a huge sign was illuminated and
transmitted on every <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX>: <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Discover Card</ENAMEX>. The new <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> and its new
Times <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Square</ENAMEX> thus achieved a complete capitulation of the civic to the
corporate, and was proud of it.

            Giddy with delight over his imposition of midtown
martial law, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mayor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rudolph Giuliani</ENAMEX> showed up on every <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Manhole</ENAMEX> covers
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">welded</ENAMEX> closed; trash cans removed; mailboxes locked; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8,000</NUMEX> cops; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> police
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">helicopters</ENAMEX>--it was like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tel Aviv</ENAMEX>, except for the part about any
known threat. But it must be admitted, the festivities were unmarred by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">terrorist</ENAMEX> bombings or <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">elephant stampedes</ENAMEX>.

            The usually fatuous <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Brokaw</ENAMEX> outdid himself when he rated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the century</TIMEX>--it was a tough one, he
blathered, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> world wars, the atomic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bomb</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Holocaust</ENAMEX>, but there
was also the triumph of the space program. I'm sure <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">6 million</NUMEX> murdered <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> and
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30 million</NUMEX> dead <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviets</ENAMEX> would agree that the space shuttle more than made up
for mass death.

<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>'s regions.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>. Make <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moscow</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homeless</ENAMEX> simply disappear, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">York</ENAMEX>-style.

            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>. Develop new
political <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> open to professional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wrestlers</ENAMEX>, anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Semites</ENAMEX>, and fat-faced,
