               "This is not about tighter buns. It's all about ... the incredible
invigoration that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> get from achieving certain goals they set out to
achieve." --<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Editor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dagny Scott</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Outside</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> spinoff <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Women</ENAMEX>

            From
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">premier</ENAMEX> chronicler of the outdoor adventure, a new <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</TIMEX> packed with
interior design tips for creating rugged, exhilarating spaces out of
standard-sized <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedrooms</ENAMEX> and kitchens. In our debut issue, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sebastian Junger</ENAMEX>
finds "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Perfect Storm Window</ENAMEX>." Plus, a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Scandinavian</ENAMEX> furniture report: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jon</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Krakauer</ENAMEX> is "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Into Finn Chairs</ENAMEX>."

            A new
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">laddie</ENAMEX> book for laddies of a certain age. A place where the sports <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> are
bigger, the breasts are seasoned, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beer</ENAMEX> is wine. The premiere issue
features a hot and heavy photo shoot, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bo Derek</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Farrah Fawcett</ENAMEX> get wild
in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Palm Springs</ENAMEX>.

            Style
is an ineffable <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">creature</ENAMEX>--what can't be seen can always be felt. Now there's a
magazine dedicated to that spirit and to the spirit of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>'s many blind
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX>. Our Braille descriptions spare no detail, bringing to life a lavish,
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX>-page photo spread on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bunny Williams</ENAMEX>' adorable <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Connecticut</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">farmhouse</ENAMEX>.
Plus, several more Braille descriptions of other lavish photo spreads. Same
glossy paper--but with bumps!

            The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">luminaries</ENAMEX> behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Prospect</ENAMEX> offer a new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journal</ENAMEX> for the
liberal libidinal imagination. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prospect Forum</ENAMEX> delivers ribald tales of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">seduction</ENAMEX> and kinky sexxx fantasies--all illustrative of the proper role for a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">compassionate</ENAMEX>, activist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Jedediah Purdy pens "Log Cabin Lovin'</ENAMEX>," a

says, "You go, Gyrl!" Watch your favorite <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">theorists</ENAMEX> tackle everybody's favorite
subject, as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Katha Pollitt</ENAMEX> limns "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">50 Progressive Ways To Make Him Scream</ENAMEX>," and

            A
message from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Lerner</ENAMEX>: "Most college guides privilege corporate values,
treating education like a commodity. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tikkun</ENAMEX> has constructed a new set of
pluralistic, democratic criteria--the 'rankings of meaning.' We've determined
which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">graduates</ENAMEX> spend <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> trekking through <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nepal</ENAMEX> or volunteering for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ineffectual NGOs</ENAMEX>. We've queried <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">departments</ENAMEX> to calculate which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professors</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">practice Pilates</ENAMEX> or ride unicycles." A sneak preview: In the first
Tikkun guide, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reed</ENAMEX> edges out <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bard</ENAMEX> for the top spot, for what it's worth,
as any hierarchy is by nature counterharmonious.

            Does <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vera Wang</ENAMEX> offer a
daily double? She'd better! Lesbian marriages are through the roof, and all
those engaged <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lesbians</ENAMEX> need a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> of their own. Here it is! Complete with
news items (the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">maid</ENAMEX> of honor shortage), the latest dos and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">don'ts</ENAMEX> (DO quote
Scripture!), and down<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">-to-the-minute</TIMEX> lesbian wedding planning guides. A perfect
gift when lesbian wedding bells are ringing for someone you love.
