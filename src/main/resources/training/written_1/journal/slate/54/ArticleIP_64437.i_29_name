            Speaking aboard the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S.S. Intrepid</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>, the presidential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> named
"potential threats" facing our <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>. Which of the following are from his list
and which are mere fabrications likely to make him go nuts and start screaming
at <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, what with that terrible temper of his?

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. Political and economic chaos in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX>.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>'s growing economic and military
threat.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Evil monkeys</ENAMEX> that might crawl up our trouser
legs and bite us on the ass.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. Violent expressions of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nationalist</ENAMEX> and ethnic
rivalry.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Cats</ENAMEX> that read our minds.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>. The proliferation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX> of mass destruction
to rogue <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> and potential <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">adversaries</ENAMEX>.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>. The control of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX> of mass destruction by a
really dumb <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX>. You know--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Orgejay Ushbay</ENAMEX>?

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>. Information warfare such as an attack on our
private sector's computer grids.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crips</ENAMEX> and Bloods merging into supergang, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blips</ENAMEX>.
Or Cruds. Either way, bad news! Even worse than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> and monkeys!

            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>. Terrorism.
