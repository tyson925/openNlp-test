<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scheindlin</ENAMEX> ruled that because there was a "top hat" but no "bad <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX>," something
must be done. What?

               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Randy</ENAMEX>'s Wrap-Up
            

            Many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News Quiz</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> treated the top hat as a self-consciously anachronistic symbol of
the rich. (The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>, not the hat, are self-conscious; although I'd wear
my hat more often if it were a little more self-aware.) But while the silk hat
no longer invokes uptown swells, no other headgear has replaced it in our
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">metonymy</ENAMEX>. Indeed, compared to the prewar <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wealthy</ENAMEX>, the contemporary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rich</ENAMEX> have no
apparent class markers. It is not just hats but entire wardrobes that fail to
denote magnificent excess: The modern rich dress like business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX>
during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> and like pop <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stars</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>, if indeed anyone is wearing
anything other than sneakers and jeans. The opera <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>--natural habitat of the
top hat (i.e., the opera hat)--is no longer the preserve of the rich; it is, if
anything, a cathedral of gay culture. Nor have the rich maintained that audible
indicator, that quasi-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX>, quasi-lockjawed accent that the swells all had
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Depression-era</TIMEX> movies. The rich now talk like everyone else, except <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trump</ENAMEX>, who speaks as if taught by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diane Fosse</ENAMEX>. Not even the long limousine
inspires a class-conscious hooligan to hurl a paving stone; the wise ragamuffin
knows he's likely not seeing a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mogul</ENAMEX> but some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Queens</ENAMEX> on the way to
their prom. In an ugly <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">tux</ENAMEX>. And entirely hatless. But he throws it anyway.

            
               Stealing From the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Poor Box Answer</ENAMEX>
            

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Way of America</ENAMEX> must pay <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Aramony</ENAMEX>,
its imprisoned former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$4.2 million</NUMEX> in deferred compensation.

            Aramony, jailed for
fraud and embezzlement after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> of stealing from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">charity</ENAMEX>, had a "top
hat " pension plan, a grotesquely lavish package of benefits far richer than
those offered to ordinary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>. Because his contract did not include a
"bad <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> "clause that would have revoked his benefits if he
committed a felony, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scheindlin</ENAMEX> ruled that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Way</ENAMEX> must pay up.

            This actual e-mail was
sent to everyone at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cond√© Nast</ENAMEX>. I intended to ask <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> to devise
similar but imaginary perqs that perfectly captured the ethos of other media
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>, but then I couldn't shake the image of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ved Mehta</ENAMEX> in spandex, so I
think I'd better go lie down and put a cold compress on my forehead. Or down my
pants. However, other examples of actual character-revealing corporate perqs
would be most welcome.
