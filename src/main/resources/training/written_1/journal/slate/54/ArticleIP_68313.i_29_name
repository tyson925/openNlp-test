            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike Leigh</ENAMEX>'s

                  Topsy-Turvy
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">broadly</ENAMEX> recounts the creation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gilbert</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sullivan</ENAMEX>'s comic opera The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mikado</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Savoy Theatre</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1885</TIMEX>.
Perhaps "broadly" is putting too fine a point on it. The <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">first hour</TIMEX>, in which
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arthur Sullivan</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allan Corduner</ENAMEX>) attempts to sever his ties with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">W.S. Gilbert</ENAMEX>
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jim Broadbent</ENAMEX>) and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owner</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Savoy</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard D'Oyly Carte</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ron Cook</ENAMEX>), is
a mess: The order of scenes feels arbitrary, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> pop up and vanish
with bewildering frequency. You might be tempted to vanish, too. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Friends of</ENAMEX>
mine did.) Be <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leigh</ENAMEX>'s movies, born of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actors</ENAMEX>' improvisations and
loosely shaped, always take a while to find their rhythm--and, frequently,
their point. This one finds everything. By the end of its <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two hours</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Topsy-Turvy</ENAMEX> has evolved into something extraordinary: a
monument to process--to the minutiae of making art. And to something more: the
fundamental sadness of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who labor to make beautiful things--who soar--and
then come down to a not-so-beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">earth</ENAMEX>.

            It would be charitable
to attribute the shapelessness of the early scenes to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX>' own lack
of focus, but it would also be inane. As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elvis Mitchell</ENAMEX> pointed out in

                  Slate
               's "," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leigh</ENAMEX>'s opening shot features an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">usher</ENAMEX> who moves
along a row of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Savoy Theatre</ENAMEX> lifting and peering under every seat. That's
every seat. You can almost hear <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leigh</ENAMEX> cackling: "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">How</ENAMEX>'s this for a fast
start?--you bourgeois slaves to narrative." Inevitably, something does happen:
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Princess Ida</ENAMEX> , one of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gilbert</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sullivan</ENAMEX>'s duds, has its premiere, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gilbert</ENAMEX> fumes over a review that calls him the monarch of "topsy-turvydom"--of
formulaic plots involving magical elixirs and coins. A heat wave has hit
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX>, theater attendance is down, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sullivan</ENAMEX> is itching to go off and
become the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English Mendelssohn</ENAMEX>--to write operas and symphonies instead of comic
"soufflés." Leigh evidently loves the bloodless formality of the scenes between
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gilbert</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sullivan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> of opposite tastes and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">temperaments</ENAMEX> who only overlap
in their work. He must also love that those scenes are narrative dead ends:
"How's this for conflict?--you bourgeois slaves to melodrama."

            The wake-up call comes <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an hour</TIMEX> into the movie. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Gilbert</ENAMEX>
attends a popular exposition of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> culture at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Knightsbridge</ENAMEX> and watches
Kabuki routines and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> in kimonos pouring green <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> ("spinach water"). When
a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">sword</ENAMEX> he has purchased falls off his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wall</ENAMEX>, he hefts it; mimes a
fight while issuing strangled, samurailike cries; then has a brainstorm. We
hear the horns of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Mikado</ENAMEX> overture, then <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leigh</ENAMEX> cuts to the fully
realized opening scene on stage at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Savoy</ENAMEX>: "We are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gentlemen</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> …"
Just that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chorus</ENAMEX> is enough to reanimate the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX>--to make <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> sit up and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">grin</ENAMEX>. And <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leigh</ENAMEX>'s technique of leaping back and forth between the finished
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mikado</ENAMEX> and painstaking scenes of rehearsal has magic in it: You're
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">watching straw</ENAMEX>, then <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX>, then <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">straw</ENAMEX>, then <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX>. And you see the
connection.

            A central section of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">drama</ENAMEX> is missing. What exactly fired <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sullivan</ENAMEX> up about doing The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mikado</ENAMEX> ?
What was different about this collaboration? No answer.
Topsy-Turvy turns into something other than the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gilbert</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sullivan</ENAMEX>
story: a portrait of life in the theater. A group portrait. D'Oyly Carte
becomes a quiet <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">protagonist</ENAMEX>, a humane <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">businessman</ENAMEX>. He softly negotiates a
salary increase with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>'s lead <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">comic</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Martin Savage</ENAMEX>), a neurasthenic
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">junkie</ENAMEX>. He gently seeks the assurance of a tipsy ingénue (the tremulous <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shirley</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henderson</ENAMEX>) that her "little weakness" will not re-emerge. In the dressing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>,
performers gossip and complain, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drink</ENAMEX> and shoot themselves up with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leigh</ENAMEX>'s ensemble casts strive to be "microcosms" of society, so issues of class
are ever present. You see it in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sullivan</ENAMEX>'s banter with the working-class
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">musicians</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pit</ENAMEX> and in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gilbert</ENAMEX>'s with the uppity <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actors</ENAMEX> (the movie's
posturing middle class), whom he drills on pronunciation and poise. The chorus
is presented as some sort of collective folk conscience when it lobbies <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gilbert</ENAMEX>
to restore the rashly cut solo ("A more humane <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mikado</ENAMEX> never did in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>
exist") of the sad, fat <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fellow</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Timothy Spall</ENAMEX>) in the title role.

            Who would have predicted that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leigh</ENAMEX> would make <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gilbert</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sullivan</ENAMEX> into <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike Leigh</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX>? <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gilbert</ENAMEX> could be a stand-in for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leigh</ENAMEX>
himself--a haughty, ill-humored <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> with an obsession for tiny details and a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">glowering</ENAMEX> dedication to process. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gilbert</ENAMEX> haggles with his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actors</ENAMEX> over small
things that shouldn't resonate but which somehow add up. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leigh</ENAMEX>'s small things
add up, too. The joke of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Mikado</ENAMEX> is that its <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lords</ENAMEX> are
thinly disguised <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bureaucrats</ENAMEX>; the joke of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Topsy-Turvy</ENAMEX> is that
the opera's <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">performers</ENAMEX> seem culturally incapable of playing <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX>.
They rehearse in long coats and top hats, and some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> (and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>!)
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">express</ENAMEX> horror at appearing on stage without corsets. Behind the satire,
however, is a reverence for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gilbert</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sullivan</ENAMEX>: The tempos are slower than
modern <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audiences</ENAMEX> are used to, and the staging has been stripped of high-camp
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accretions</ENAMEX>. I saw a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D'Oyly Carte</ENAMEX> production of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Mikado</ENAMEX> in the late
'70s: It was played fast and to the groundlings and made me never want to see a
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">G&S</TIMEX> opera again. Now I can't wait for the next production.

            Only a lunatic would
call <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Topsy-Turvy</ENAMEX> , with its <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">lame first hour</TIMEX> and host of loose ends, a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">masterpiece</ENAMEX>, but by the finale I was ready to have myself committed. The finale
itself must have done it. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leigh</ENAMEX>'s endings are often wondrous, and this one is
up there with the rooftop scene in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">High</ENAMEX> Hopes (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX>). The Mikado
is a triumph--it would be the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Savoy</ENAMEX>'s biggest hit--but there's no
transformation in the lives of its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">makers</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gilbert</ENAMEX> can't bring himself to reach
out to his brokenhearted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lesley Manville</ENAMEX>), and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sullivan</ENAMEX> has a melancholy
inkling that he has reached his artistic peak. The ingénue, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Leonora</ENAMEX>, is
drinking again, toasting herself in the mirror and praising the loveliness of
Nature--a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nature</ENAMEX> that will, of course, destroy her. The final image is of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Art</ENAMEX>:
Leonora on stage singing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yum-Yum</ENAMEX>'s sublime "The sun whose rays are all ablaze
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">…</ENAMEX>" As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leigh</ENAMEX>'s camera pulls back over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">orchestra</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX>, this movie
feels like one of the saddest and loveliest tributes to the lives of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX>
ever made. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Topsy-Turvy</ENAMEX> leaves you upside down and breathless.

            Like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike Leigh</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Errol Morris</ENAMEX> rarely begins a project with
a clear idea of what he wants it to be. Sometimes he doesn't end a project with
a clear idea of what he wants it to be, either. His newest documentary,

                  Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Death : The Rise and Fall</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fred D. Leuchter</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jr.</ENAMEX>
               , kicks up all sorts of messy emotions that his coolly ironic
technique can't begin to handle.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> is in his
weird element only in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the first half-hour</TIMEX>, in which he sits his subject down
and gets out of his way. Leuchter, who looks a little like the archetypal movie
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dweeb Charles Martin Smith</ENAMEX> and has a heavy exurbs-of-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX> accent, explains
how he became involved in redesigning problematic electric chairs. "Excess
current <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cooks</ENAMEX> the tissue," he says, barely suppressing a smirk at his own
expertise. "There've been occasions where a great amount of current has been
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">applied</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meat</ENAMEX> actually will come off the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">executee</ENAMEX>'s bone like the meat
coming off a cooked <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chicken</ENAMEX>." <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leuchter</ENAMEX> set about making capital punishment more
"humane." He moves on to talking about his redesigns for lethal-injection
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX>, gas <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chambers</ENAMEX>, and even a gallows, while underneath, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Caleb Sampson</ENAMEX>
provides macabre funhouse music and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">wistful calliope waltzes</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morris</ENAMEX>' distance
from his subject implies condescension--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leuchter</ENAMEX> looks like something in a jar.
But that's OK, because the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> is an interesting specimen. Is he a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">monster</ENAMEX> or a
humanist committed to eliminating the "deplawrable tawchaw" of capital
punishment? It could go either way.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M r. Death</ENAMEX> gets into deeper <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX> when it recounts
the trial of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ernst Zundel</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> for proclaiming that the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Holocaust</ENAMEX> never
happened. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zundel</ENAMEX> hired <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leuchter</ENAMEX> to go to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Auschwitz</ENAMEX> and examine the "alleged"
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas chambers</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Footage</ENAMEX> (taken by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zundel</ENAMEX>'s cameraman) shows the little man
chiseling at walls, vandalizing what even he admits are international <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrines</ENAMEX>.
Leuchter smuggled specimens of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rock</ENAMEX> and concrete back to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>,
where chemical analysis revealed no cyanide <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX>. Furthermore, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leuchter</ENAMEX> can't
figure out how the gas would even have been administered without killing the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nazis</ENAMEX> themselves--proof, he argues, that mass extermination at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Auschwitz</ENAMEX> never
took place. The subsequent "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Leuchter Report</ENAMEX>" became the backbone of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zundel</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">defense</ENAMEX> (he lost anyway) and of the burgeoning revisionist movement led by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Irving</ENAMEX>. But if <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leuchter</ENAMEX> became a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hero</ENAMEX> to neo-Nazis, he also became a
target of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pariah</ENAMEX> even in the execution business. When
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morris</ENAMEX> hooks up with him for the last time, he's in hiding from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">creditors</ENAMEX>.

            Is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leuchter</ENAMEX> a raving
anti-Semite or a pathetic pawn who thrived on having--for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time in his
life--a bit of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">celebrity</ENAMEX>? The film suggests the latter. It certainly produces
no evidence of malice. Plenty of monstrous insensitivity and hubris, though.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morris</ENAMEX> uses the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">historian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Jan van Pelt</ENAMEX> as a counternarrator: He
calls Leuchter "a fffool " who didn't have a clue what to look for in a
place that had changed enormously in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50 years</TIMEX>. "If he had spent time in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">archives</ENAMEX>," says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">van Pelt</ENAMEX>, "he would have found evidence about ventilation
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX>, ways to introduce <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zyclon</ENAMEX> B into these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>--but of course I don't
think he knows <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> so it wouldn't have helped very much." The most
devastating rebuttal is from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chemist</ENAMEX> in charge of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Auschwitz</ENAMEX> analysis,
who explains that the gas wouldn't have penetrated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 10</NUMEX> microns into
the wall (a human hair is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100 microns</NUMEX> thick), so by crushing the samples
(standard procedure), he had effectively diluted the cyanide <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100,000</NUMEX> times.
Against all this, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morris</ENAMEX> shows footage of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leuchter</ENAMEX> chiseling at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Auschwitz</ENAMEX> and
even adds some of his own, along with slow-motion shots of hammers bashing
rocks, walls, floors, etc. It's an obscenity.

            After my rage at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leuchter</ENAMEX> had subsided, I began to get
angry at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morris</ENAMEX> for aestheticizing that violation--turning it into an ironic
art object. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX>'s beautiful detachment suggests a kind of cowardice.
His technique is based on standing back--maintaining a fixed distance--while
his subjects hang themselves, and for a while that works stunningly. But at a
certain point, isn't it only human to want to engage this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>? You don't need
to play <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike Wallace</ENAMEX> and demolish <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leuchter</ENAMEX> on camera. You could just ask him
what he makes of, say, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">van Pelt</ENAMEX>'s assertion that the answer to the riddle of
the gas <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chambers</ENAMEX> was all over the archives, or what he thought of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chemist</ENAMEX>'s
declaration that the test performed for cyanide was the wrong test. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morris</ENAMEX> can
be heard asking <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> question only: "Have you ever thought you might be wrong or
that you made a mistake<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">?</ENAMEX>"--sufficiently broad that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leuchter</ENAMEX> can casually affirm
his own inanity.

            My concern here isn't so much for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leuchter</ENAMEX> or even
the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Holocaust</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">revisionists</ENAMEX>, who'll just think he was sandbagged. The problem is
that when a documentary filmmaker seems too scared or cool or arty to violate
his own immaculate aesthetic, he ends up weakening his case. He also provides
no emotional release, which isn't a small matter when the subject is <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Holocaust</ENAMEX>
denial. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morris</ENAMEX> was close enough to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leuchter</ENAMEX> to have gotten something more, to
have gone a little deeper in search of a poison that does penetrate
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">surfaces</ENAMEX>.
