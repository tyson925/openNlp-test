                  Dear
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudence</ENAMEX>,
               
            

            
               My <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> and I have always been very
close. We've been a source of strength for each other ever since my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>
died <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eight years ago</TIMEX>. However, a recent humiliating experience now threatens
that close bond. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">One weekend</TIMEX>, while I believed my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> was away with his best
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">friend</ENAMEX>, I was trying on some swimsuits for an upcoming vacation. I was checking
them out in the mirror, and I like to think that, at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45</NUMEX>, I look pretty damn
good.
            

            
               While naked, I went
to get something from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen</ENAMEX>, and who did I see but my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> standing there!
His <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekend</TIMEX> had been cut short, and he had let himself into our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX>. With
my hands full, I couldn't even cover myself up. Fortunately, he ran from the
room right away, but not before seeing me in all my naked glory. Since then
he's hardly spoken to me. He doesn't even look at me when he comes home from
school. I want to talk to him about this, but what could I say?

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dear Thal</ENAMEX>,

            You say that even his
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mother</ENAMEX> has one of these and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of those. You weren't vamping him, after all,
and both of you made a swift effort to end the scene. He wasn't even supposed
to be there, which you might point out to him. The fact that your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">household</ENAMEX> has
been just the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of you since he was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7 years old</TIMEX> may mean that he's had to
wrestle with his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oedipal</ENAMEX> feelings that his little-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> wish for his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> to be
removed was granted. You might also ask him why he thinks there's been a change
in your relationship. Try to bring up the uncomfortable encounter, and tell him
he is making much too much of it. With luck, the very act of discussing it will
defuse the situation.

            
--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudie</ENAMEX>, rationally

            
               
                  Dear
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudence</ENAMEX>,
               
            

            
               I'm a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20-year-old</TIMEX> college <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> living in a
major <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few months ago</TIMEX> I moved into an apartment <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> mostly
occupied by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>. Recently I asked a neighbor how I could keep my plants
alive when I went home for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three weeks</TIMEX>. I didn't want to give anyone a key to
my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX>, but wanted to know if there was another way. She told me that she
would water them and, in fact, already had a key that the previous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">resident</ENAMEX> had
given her!
            

            
               The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX> is friendly and seems trustworthy.
She asked for a contact number for me, in case something happened in the
building--like a water leak--so I feel that she has good intentions. The
problem is that I don't want any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> having a key to my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX>. I also
do not wish to offend her by asking for the key back.
            

            
               Should I let the
matter slide; should I ask the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> to change the locks; or should I ask for
the key back?
            

            
               --<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thanks</ENAMEX>,
            

            

               Looking for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Key</ENAMEX> to Keeping <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Safe</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sorry</ENAMEX> for the bad pun.)
            

            Dear Look,

            As for wanting someone to water your <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> without
using a key to get in, your only hope is to engage one of those building
climbers to crawl in from the outside--but then that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> would still
be inside your <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX>. If you are dead set against anyone gaining access in
your absence, you might ask someone if he or she would be willing to let you
move your <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> to their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the three weeks</TIMEX>.

            As for the neighbor
having your key given to her by the old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tenant</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> should have coughed
it up <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the minute</TIMEX> you moved in. If you decide she is a neighbor you would like
to have your key, that's one thing, but if you decide she is not the one--or
that no one is--by all means ask for it back. Tell her it's nothing personal,
but the setup made by the previous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tenant</ENAMEX> is now moot, and you've made other
arrangements. There is no reason for you to feel shy about this. It is your
apartment and your key.

                  Dear
Prudie ,
            

            
               As a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX>, I feel
for "." As a simple matter of course, as soon as a manuscript is completed, its
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> should formally register it with <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Gummint</ENAMEX>. The copyright to anything
she writes is hers the moment she writes it, paperwork or no, but registering
it gives added benefits--including a vast escalation of penalties if someone
swipes her work. If she sent her <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one and only one</NUMEX> copy of her novel to what
amounts to a total <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stranger</ENAMEX>, her best course of action would be to go out and
treat herself to a fabulous lunch. Then she should go home, stand in front of
the biggest mirror in her <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>, and say to herself: "I promise never to tell
my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hairdresser</ENAMEX> to make me look like a picture I've torn out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">People</ENAMEX>
magazine. I promise never to buy a secondhand <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> from a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> or family
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX>. I promise never, ever, under any circumstances to allow there to be one
and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> copy of my manuscript on the planet."

            Dear Create,

            Your suggestions for a
fabulous lunch plus copyright tips were soothing and useful. You are absolutely
right, by the way, about finding hairdos in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">People</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudie</ENAMEX> did
that once and looked like a very old <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12-year-old</TIMEX>.

            
--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudie</ENAMEX>, nostalgically

            
               
                  Dear
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudence</ENAMEX>,
               
            

            
               Since I have just recently started reading your
advice column, I am not completely sure what your views are on sexual
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">orientation</ENAMEX>. Since that is a large part of this question, I will ask you to
disregard this question if you consider homosexuality immoral, wrong, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Satan</ENAMEX>'s
work, etc., etc. I've heard it all. However, if you are a rational <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> with
an open mind, please read on.
            

            
               I am a 20-year-old
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homosexual</ENAMEX> who is engaged to my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lover</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chris</ENAMEX>. We have been engaged for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">four</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">union</ENAMEX> is planned for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</TIMEX>. Because of our engagement, we both
wear very nice diamond rings. At work, I am often pestered for details about
"the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>." I really see no need to come out at work, as it could well alter
my career for the worse. What should I say to these nosey <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who ask for
details?
            

            

               --<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Akron</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX>
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dear Dave</ENAMEX>,

            You are lucky that the beloved has a gender-neutral
name! Just say to the next <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">busybody</ENAMEX> who asks, "I am engaged to a fine person
named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chris</ENAMEX>, and I make it a practice to keep my work and my personal life
separate. I know you will respect my wishes."

            As for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudie</ENAMEX>'s views on
sexual orientation, she believes everyone ought to have one ... a sexual
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">orientation</ENAMEX>, that is. At some point she hopes that you might feel free to live
in the open with no expectation of career-damaging consequences or disapproval.
As for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Satan, Prudie</ENAMEX> does not believe he exists. Well, maybe he did show up
once--at her first wedding--as the groom.

            
--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudie</ENAMEX>, liberally

            
               
                  Dear
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudence</ENAMEX>,
               
            

            
               You answered a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several months ago</TIMEX> regarding my
little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX>, my designated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">maid</ENAMEX> of honor, being a nightmare to deal with. She
has since apologized profusely (my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mom</ENAMEX> showed her the letter) and has sought
psychological help to deal with her misplaced anger. In a world as cynical as
it is impersonal, I wanted to thank you for your help. You've really made a
difference in my life, and I thought that you ought to know that the work you
do has value.
            

            
               Best wishes for the
New <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Year</TIMEX>!
            

            
               
--Tamara
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dear Tam</ENAMEX>,

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudie</ENAMEX> thanks you and
thinks your letter is a wonderful way to close out the old year and welcome the
new. She wishes for her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> solutions, resolutions, and every <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">now</TIMEX> and then
moments of joy.
