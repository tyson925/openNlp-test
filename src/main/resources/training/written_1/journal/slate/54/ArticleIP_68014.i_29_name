            Lately, various <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observers</ENAMEX> have proclaimed "the
death of distance." A bit melodramatic, maybe, but it's true that, in an age of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">airplanes</ENAMEX> and optical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX>, the world seems pretty small. For that matter,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">distance</ENAMEX> has been in decline for millenniums. Ever since <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> were first
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">paddled</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">wagon wheels</ENAMEX> first turned, physical separation has become less and
less of an obstacle to commerce and communication.

            Unfortunately, distance has also become less of an
obstacle to mayhem. Any vehicle that can carry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">merchants</ENAMEX> and merchandise can
carry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">warriors</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX>. Germs can hitch a ride, too. The black death that
ravaged <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 14 th century</TIMEX> seems to have started in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX> and
followed trade routes west. In general, the march of progress has brought fresh
reasons to fear what lies beyond the horizon.

            As distance enters its
death throes, this sort of fear will have a richer grounding than ever. New
conduits of harm will flourish. The current scare <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about millennium</TIMEX>-eve
terrorism is just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> small example.

            But cheer up! The coming globalization of fear isn't
entirely regrettable. It could actually make us, in a sense, better <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>,
more sensitive to suffering around the world. The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21 st century</TIMEX> may
even <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witness</ENAMEX> what you could call the death--or at least the decline--of moral
distance.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> big source of
long-distance fear will be the Internet. The problem isn't just virus
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designers</ENAMEX>, privacy invaders, and other malicious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hackers</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Net</ENAMEX> spreads
dangerous data: how to build a conventional or nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bomb</ENAMEX>, a chemical or
biological <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapon</ENAMEX>, and where to get the ingredients. With these <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX> in
hand, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorist</ENAMEX> can use low-tech means of conquering distance--say, crossing
a border with an atom <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bomb</ENAMEX> in a trunk or a vial of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">anthrax</ENAMEX> in a vest
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pocket</ENAMEX>.

            Higher-tech transport will also be available. Already, a
model-sized airplane--weighing <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">29 pounds</NUMEX>, with a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">9-foot</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wingspan</ENAMEX>--has flown
across the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic Ocean</ENAMEX>, steered precisely by global positioning satellites.
It doesn't take great imagination to envision a poor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>'s cruise <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missile</ENAMEX> with
a payload of chemical or biological weapons.

            The general trend dates back at least to the
invention of gunpowder: As technology advances, the growing power, compactness,
and accessibility of lethal technologies mean that more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in more lands
have the option of committing atrocities of greater and greater severity. But
the trend is now reaching critical mass, a threshold that warrants a rethinking
of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>'s stance toward the world.

            After all, not even the
most gung-ho Star Wars booster thinks that a missile shield can screen out
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eagle</ENAMEX>-sized <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">airplanes</ENAMEX> or nukes in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">minivans</ENAMEX>. And the standard recipe for
deterring aggression--assured retaliation--may work fine with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, but it's
problematic with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX>.

            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end</TIMEX>, we may have to try a radical approach to
fighting terrorism: reduce the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who feel alienated and
aggrieved enough to become <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> place.

            Obviously, this won't be easy, given the diversity
of grievances and the geopolitical complexity surrounding them. Besides, to
indulge specific grievances once they've become terrorist causes is to
encourage terrorism. Still, there are a few things we can do.

            First, we can acknowledge, and maybe even do
something about, some of the disaffecting fallout from globalization, such as
pollution and cultural dislocation. Rightly or wrongly, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> is seen as
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">globalization</ENAMEX>'s prime mover and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> cheerleader and will be blamed for its
excesses until we start paying official attention to them.

            <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, whereas traditional foreign policy has
focused on winning respect from foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX>, we will need to focus more
and more on winning the respect of foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peoples</ENAMEX>.

            And, as for the
type of respect we seek: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Machiavelli</ENAMEX>'s advice--that it is better to be
feared than loved--will make much less sense in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 21 st century</TIMEX>
than it did in the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">16 th</NUMEX> . Goodwill toward <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> is becoming a
national-security asset worth cultivating.

            A prime example of an outmoded policy is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinton</ENAMEX>
administration's response to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">embassy</ENAMEX> bombings. Even with a bunch of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists conveniently</ENAMEX> assembled in a single spot, the cruise <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missile</ENAMEX> strike
in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> was self-defeating: It no doubt guaranteed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Osama Bin Laden</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recruits</ENAMEX> for every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorist</ENAMEX> who was killed. And torching that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Sudanese</ENAMEX>
pharmaceutical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> didn't do much to dampen <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-American</ENAMEX> sentiment in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sudan</ENAMEX>.

            So what's a few radicalized <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Sudanese</ENAMEX> in the scheme
of things? <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Several decades ago</TIMEX>, the answer was: not much. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Several decades</TIMEX> from
now, the answer could be: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX> deaths in midtown <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manhattan</ENAMEX>.

            There is a second sense in which the security of
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> will increasingly demand attention to the plight of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreigners</ENAMEX>. It
took <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> for the bubonic plague to spread from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Western Europe</ENAMEX> in the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14 th century</TIMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> it takes <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Ebola</ENAMEX> virus to
travel halfway around the world.

            Here, as with terrorism, it is less feasible to
wall ourselves off from the problem than to address the root cause: disease
abroad, especially in developing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nations</ENAMEX>, where industrialization has turned
some <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> into a paradise for viruses and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>.

            In one realm of
life--finance--almost everyone now accepts that technology is tying the welfare
of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> more closely to the welfare of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreigners</ENAMEX>; in a globalized
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">economy</ENAMEX>, an economic downturn abroad can be contagious. Hence the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monetary Fund</ENAMEX>. The same logic will apply more and more to medical health and
what you might call cultural and political health. The less disease abroad, the
less cultural alienation abroad, the less political grievance abroad, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">healthier</ENAMEX> and safer <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> will be.

            But if you care more about faraway <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in faraway lands
only because their welfare may affect yours, does that really count as moral
improvement? Does self-interested concern for others make you a good
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>?

            That depends on what you mean by good. In Flannery
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O'Connor</ENAMEX>'s story "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A Good Man Is Hard To Find</ENAMEX>," a crotchety and self-centered
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">grandmother</ENAMEX>, held at gunpoint by an escaped convict in rural <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Georgia</ENAMEX>, becomes
suddenly sensitive. She sympathizes with her captor, seeks the causes of his
alienation, exhorts him to spiritual self-help. After killing her, the convict
remarks, "She would of been a good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>, if it had been somebody there to
shoot her every <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minute</TIMEX> of her life." With the decline of distance, there will
be more and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">more minutes</TIMEX> of our lives when somebody will be there to shoot us.
Might as well make the best of it.
