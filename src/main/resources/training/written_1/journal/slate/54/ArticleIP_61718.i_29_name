            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News Quiz</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>
scorn not just electronic greeting cards, but all greeting cards as prepackaged
expressions of sentiment for the emotionally illiterate. But isn't that a good
thing, meeting a real <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> need, much as do village <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scribes</ENAMEX> in rural <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>?
No. Not to orthodox quiz <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>, for whom greeting cards are to genuine
manifestations of feeling what Big Macs are to real <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hamburgers</ENAMEX>, with some sort
of joke about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hallmark</ENAMEX> and bulimia--and an ugly image that would be, if only I
had the wit to express it. (Why isn't there a card!) Perhaps the crime isn't
that cards are prepackaged but that they are false--the impersonal disguised as
the personal, a mere pretense of affection, like corporate gift-giving,
particularly when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> passes out <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prostitutes</ENAMEX> who, I'm told by corporate
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">insiders</ENAMEX>, only pretend to like you. (And which will not be offered after the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mobil Exxon</ENAMEX> merger. At least not to gay <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>: Nothing judgmental, it's a
cost-cutting thing.) Or perhaps it's merely a matter of quality. No one seems
to mind a nice pre-written <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare</ENAMEX> sonnet, and that's why I'm going to send
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> out just for you. Because I--wadda ya call it--love you. Happy
holidays.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">About a million</NUMEX> of these electronic cards feature
an interfaith greeting, mostly <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Judeo-Christian</ENAMEX> holiday cheer--<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santa</ENAMEX> in a
yarmulke, a reindeer with menorah antlers, that sort of nonsense.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Purists demurred</ENAMEX>, acting out their predictable
roles in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the holiday</TIMEX> drama. "It is mistaken and misguided to synthesize the
distinct symbols of our <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> traditions," said Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher Leighton</ENAMEX>,
executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institute for Christian</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jewish Studies</ENAMEX> and, I'm
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">guessing</ENAMEX>, not a medical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX>, but a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> who appreciates an honorific.

            "It is a terrible sign of intellectual and
religious confusion," carped <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elliott Abrams</ENAMEX>, author of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Faith or Fear: How</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Jews Can Survive in a Christian America</ENAMEX> . "Each of these religions must
remain an immutable hodgepodge of customs, superstitions, and prejudices," he
did not add.

            Also available, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jewish Christmas-tree</ENAMEX> ornaments--a
dreidel, a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Mogen David</ENAMEX>--none of which includes the cheery holiday message: "I'm
hedging my bets with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lord</ENAMEX>."

            Also unavailable, a card showing a couple of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Macabees</ENAMEX> beating the hell out of a yeshiva boy, just like real <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christians</ENAMEX>.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">About half</NUMEX> of all
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American Jews</ENAMEX> intermarry, up from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 percent</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1970</TIMEX>. "And they're all going to
hell," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abrams</ENAMEX> did not declaim, "to the extent that we real <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> have a hell,
which isn't much. Not like I'm jealous of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christians</ENAMEX> or anything. They've
got hell, but we've got <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barbra Streisand</ENAMEX>."
