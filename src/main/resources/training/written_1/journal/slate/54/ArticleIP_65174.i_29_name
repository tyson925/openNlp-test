            It's
too early to know whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Bradley</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Gore</ENAMEX> will win the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arizona</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democratic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Party</ENAMEX> primary on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 11, 2000</TIMEX>. But if the election goes according
to plan, almost every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voter</ENAMEX> in the primary will make worldwide history by
casting a ballot over the Internet.

            This
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">month</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> agreed to become the first political <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> anywhere on
the globe to hold a legally binding election over the Internet. And whether
voting from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> or a local schoolhouse, most of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arizona</ENAMEX>'s anticipated 20,000
to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> will use the Net to vote.

            The
development disturbs some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voter</ENAMEX> education <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. At least one is considering
legal action to stop the primary. "I'm very troubled that a public election is
going to occur with an untried, unproven technology," said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Deborah Philips</ENAMEX>, who
studies online voting issues for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Voting Integrity Project</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philips</ENAMEX> said
that she has spoken to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>-based election law <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. Miller Baker</ENAMEX>
about pursuing legal responses to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX>'s decision to use Net voting.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX>
confirmed that he is "looking at" the possibility of suing the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arizona</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX>.
"We have grave doubts whether an election by this method would comport with
minimal constitutional requirements for a fraud-free election."

            
Regardless of whether a lawsuit is filed, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arizona</ENAMEX>'s planned primary
demonstrates that online voting has moved rapidly from a controversial theory
to a real business. According to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> estimate, there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over half a million</NUMEX>
public elections in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every year</TIMEX>. That creates a potential
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">multimillion</ENAMEX>-dollar market for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> providing voting services.

            
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arizona Democratic Party</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> have hired <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Votation</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Garden City</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Long Island-based</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX> which
is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">less than a year old</TIMEX>. In a separate announcement, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Votation</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX> also
disclosed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</TIMEX> that it has received a minority equity investment from
VeriSign, the publicly traded digital certification <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX> based in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mountain</ENAMEX>
View, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Calif.</ENAMEX>

            
Neither the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> nor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Votation</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX> would provide a figure for how much the
service costs, although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Votation</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mel Schrieberg</ENAMEX>, who has handled
many elections for labor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unions</ENAMEX> and nonprofit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, says that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>
using it "save substantially on postage and paper."

            
Indeed, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arizona Democratic Party</ENAMEX> will use Internet ballots not just for
remote <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX>, but even at polling places. "We'll have paper ballots [at
polling places] for those who are afraid to use the Net, mostly because of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">unfamiliarity</ENAMEX>," says <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arizona</ENAMEX> state party <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark Fleisher</ENAMEX>. "But I would
guess that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95 percent</NUMEX> of the ballots cast statewide will be over the
Internet."

            Remote
Internet <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> will, like those using absentee ballots, have a slightly wider
voting window than those going to physical locations. The Net "polls" will be
open from <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12:01 a.m.</TIMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 10</TIMEX>, until <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">7:01 p.m.</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 11</TIMEX>,
when the physical polling <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">booths</ENAMEX> will close as well.

            Both
the state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Votation</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX> downplay any concerns about potential voter
fraud. According to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> will be able to verify their identity
using their date of birth and a digital signature. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Critics</ENAMEX> point out, however,
that neither the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Election Commission</ENAMEX> nor the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arizona</ENAMEX> has
certified any standards for Internet voting.

            Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arizona</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX>
would probably be the largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> affected by any potential Net voting fraud
or security breach, the campaigns for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Bradley</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Gore</ENAMEX> would also
presumably be affected. If, however, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> campaign is worried, they're not
saying so publicly. "We view anything that helps expand participation in the
electoral process as a positive development," says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ben Green</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of
Internet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX> campaign declined to provide a
comment for this story.
