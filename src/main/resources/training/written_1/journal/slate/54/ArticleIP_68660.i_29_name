            The
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekly</TIMEX> poll on the Web site of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democratic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Committee</ENAMEX> asked
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>: "As the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> approaches <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a new millennium</TIMEX>, what are the most
important priorities facing our next <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>? Saving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">strengthening Medicare</ENAMEX> and paying down the debt or implementing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George W.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1.7 trillion</NUMEX> risky tax scheme that overwhelmingly benefits the
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">wealthy?</ENAMEX>"

            Thanks
to an organized <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> effort, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than two-thirds</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX>
favored <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>'s tax cuts, prompting an embarrassed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DNC</ENAMEX> to remove the poll from
its site. News coverage of the incident explained that the poll was non-binding
and non-scientific. But you could go further than that. Online polls aren't
even polls.

            A poll
purports to tell you something about the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> at large, or at least the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> from which the sample was drawn (for example, likely <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democratic</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Hampshire</ENAMEX>). Surprising though it may seem, the results of a
scientific poll of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a few hundred</NUMEX> randomly sampled <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> can be extrapolated to
the larger population (to a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95 percent</NUMEX> degree of confidence and within a margin
of error). (For a primer on "margin of error" and "degree of confidence," see
this 
                  Slate
                ".") But the results of an online "poll" in which
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> or even <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> participate cannot be extrapolated to
anything, because those results tell you only about the opinions of those who
participated. Online polls are actually elections, of a kind. And elections,
while a fine way to pick a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>, are a decidedly poor way to measure
public sentiment.

            Why
aren't online polls an accurate measure of public opinion?

            

               <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Respondents</ENAMEX> are not randomly selected. Online polls are a
direct descendent of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX> and magazine straw polls, which were popular in
the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">19 th</NUMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 20 th centuries</TIMEX>. The print-media straw
polls (very different from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s political straw polls but equally
inaccurate) featured clip-out coupons that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> sent in to cast ballots for
their preferred <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX>. Other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">organizers</ENAMEX> of straw polls mailed ballots to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> on a list of names. The most infamous of these took place in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1936</TIMEX> when
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Literary Digest</ENAMEX> sent <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 million</NUMEX> presidential ballots to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, based on
telephone directories and automobile registration lists. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">More than 2 million</NUMEX> of
the ballots were returned, and based on the results, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> predicted
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alf Landon</ENAMEX> would carry <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">57 percent</NUMEX> of the popular vote and defeat
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Franklin Delano Roosevelt</ENAMEX> in a landslide.

            

               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Literary Digest</ENAMEX> was wrong, of course, and straw polls never recovered,
at least as a predictive tool. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reader</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewer</ENAMEX> surveys continue to prosper,
however, in magazine contests, on TV shows like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNN</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">TalkBack Live</ENAMEX> , and
on Web sites.

            

               <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. Socioeconomic bias. Some of the common criticisms of online
polling could be lobbed at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Literary Digest</ENAMEX> survey. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1936</TIMEX>, only a
relatively small and wealthy portion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">electorate</ENAMEX> owned a telephone or an
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">automobile</ENAMEX>. Likewise, many have criticized online polling because Internet
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> tend to be wealthier, more educated, and more male than the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> at
large. For this reason, many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> assume Internet poll results to be biased
in favor of the viewpoints of relatively wealthy, highly educated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX>.

            But
even saying that gives such polls too much credit. A scientific poll of the
political opinions of Internet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">users</ENAMEX> would be subject to that socioeconomic
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bias</ENAMEX> (even random-digit telephone polls are only valid for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> owning telephones). An online poll--even one that eliminates the
problem of multiple voting--doesn't tell you anything about Internet
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> as a whole, just about those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> who participated in the poll.

            

               <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. Questions and answers are always given in the same order.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Pollsters</ENAMEX> speak of both the "primacy effect" and the "recency effect," meaning
that the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> and last choices are more likely to be chosen, particularly when
there is a long list of possible answers. In addition, the order in which
questions are given can affect the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX>' answers. For example, a
question about "the longest economic expansion in history" might affect
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX>' answers to a subsequent question about the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>'s job
approval. Scientific polls account for these effects by rotating the order of
both the questions and the answers.

            Of
course, even scientific polls are subject to error, and not just to the
standard "margin of error" that is due to assumed errors in sample selection.
As in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DNC</ENAMEX> poll, questions can be biased. Errors can also be made by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interviewers</ENAMEX> and by data processors. Despite these possibilities, scientific
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">polling</ENAMEX> has a long, reliable history, whereas "straw polling" has a long
history of total unreliability.

            As
long as they are meant as entertainment, and as long as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> understand what
their results communicate, there's no reason to lose much sleep over online
polls. What is worrisome is the failure of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pollsters</ENAMEX> themselves to learn from
the history of their profession. Even if they bill themselves as "voting <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX>"
rather than "polling sites," Web sites such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dick Morris</ENAMEX>' Vote.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">com</ENAMEX> tacitly imply that the results
of their online polls are reliable and valid. Otherwise, why <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">would Morris</ENAMEX>
bother to send Vote.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX>'s results to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>?

            Another online <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pollster</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harris Interactive</ENAMEX>, is using its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harris Poll Online</ENAMEX> to learn about the public's
views on the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> election. In order to overcome socioeconomic bias, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harris</ENAMEX> is
using what is known as "quota <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sampling</ENAMEX>," which ensures that the poll's
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX> are an accurate reflection of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>'s demographics. Quota
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sampling</ENAMEX> assumes that the answers of a particular demographic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> such as
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">white</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18-to</NUMEX>-25-year-old Internet <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> can be projected to describe the
opinions of white <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18-to-25-year-olds</TIMEX> at large. This technique was in widespread
use until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1948</TIMEX>, when the major national polls based on this technique all
predicted that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas E. Dewey</ENAMEX> would defeat incumbent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Democrat</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harry</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. Truman</ENAMEX>.
