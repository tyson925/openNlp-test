            I was terrible at math when
I was young (if anything, I'm worse now), but that didn't stop me from reading
everything nontechnical I could get my hands on concerning topology, which my
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dictionary</ENAMEX> defines as "a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> of mathematics that deals with the properties
of a geometric figure which do not vary when the figure is transformed in
certain ways." However arcane, it was the most anecdotally fascinating area of
math: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moebius</ENAMEX> strips; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Klein</ENAMEX> bottles; the four-color map problem; the protean
qualities of the torus, or doughnut. That I couldn't have begun to understand
the theory didn't trouble me, although I did feel that I was misappropriating
something haughtily above my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX>. I would focus on a single mind-bending
element--for example, that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Klein</ENAMEX> bottle's neck (roughly speaking) folds
back into its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>, making inner and outer a single surface and the whole a
two-dimensional object however much airspace it might occupy--and send myself
on a little psychedelic journey contemplating the paradox.

            Much the
same applies to neurology, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oliver Sacks</ENAMEX>' area of specialization. Scientifically
challenged <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> can be entranced by the dérèglement de tous les sens
charge obtainable from his descriptions of anomalies of memory and perception;
lack of knowledge of the exact workings of the cerebral cortex is hardly a
deterrent. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sacks</ENAMEX>' accounts of aphasia or amnesia or autism or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tourette</ENAMEX>'s
syndrome provide a certain believe-it-or-not quotient for the lay <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX>; they
also have the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> of parables. His best-known book, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Man Who</ENAMEX> Mistook
His <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Wife</ENAMEX> for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hat</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1985</TIMEX>), is less a freak show than a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">gallery</ENAMEX> in which we
can see ourselves reflected variously, with one element out of whack,
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">fun-house-</ENAMEX>mirror style. The views are frequently precipitous, causing the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reader</ENAMEX> to reflect upon those delicate and unaccountable features of the brain,
ordinarily taken for granted, with appropriate wonder.

            The lure of the case study as a literary genre has been
insufficiently examined. It can take a number of forms: the prurient (as in
much of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Freud's</ENAMEX>), the haunting (ditto), the sordid-poetic (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kraft-Ebbing</ENAMEX>, for
example), the pregnant-random (as in much of criminology). The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">closer</ENAMEX>--and most
eminent--predecessor to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sacks</ENAMEX>' own approach was the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">psychologist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">A.R.</ENAMEX>
Luria, whose <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Mind of a Mnemonist</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1968</TIMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Man With a</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shattered World</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1972</TIMEX>) are book-length case studies of novelistic richness.
The mnemonist, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">S.</ENAMEX>, is a touching <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> whose "disorder" is the most poetic
imaginable even as it brings him torment. He cannot forget anything, and if he
needs to put something out of mind, he has to take a mental walk down his
mental road and dig a mental hole in which to bury it; he is also afflicted (if
"afflicted" is the word) with synesthesia, as well as with an uncertain grasp
of self. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Luria</ENAMEX>'s observations are clinical, but they exude a tangible warmth.
He--and consequently, his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX>--cannot consider S. without entering his
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">consciousness</ENAMEX>, identifying with him.

            The same
can be said of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sacks</ENAMEX>, who clearly loves his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>. In An Anthropologist
on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mars</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sacks</ENAMEX> deepens his focus ( <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Man Who</ENAMEX> Mistook
comprised <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 24</NUMEX> cases, An Anthropologist <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only seven</NUMEX>), entering
the world of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>, seeing their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> lives, traveling with them (most
of his earlier cases were observed in hospital settings), and consequently his
accounts become the more affecting even as they involve more hard science. But
the lay <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> can bypass the technical data embedded in the story of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painter</ENAMEX> who became totally colorblind following an accident (and a possible
<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX>), and ponder instead the near-mystical shift that occurred in someone
formerly dependent on color who came to forget what color was, and to value his
achromatopic perception without regret or sense of handicap. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">surgeon</ENAMEX> with
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tourette's</ENAMEX>, the blind <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who regained his sight to his dismay, the subjects
variously marooned in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hippie subculture</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1969</TIMEX> or in a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Tuscan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> of
the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">1930s</NUMEX>, the remarkably gifted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">autists</ENAMEX>--all are admirable, all are moving,
all are acutely recognizable in human terms. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> might be forgiven for
wondering if he or she might not possess a touch of autism or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tourette's</ENAMEX>. This
is not the same thing as leafing through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merck Manual</ENAMEX> and imagining
that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> possesses every symptom; rather, it is a measure of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sacks</ENAMEX>' imaginative
capacity for feeling empathy, and for transmitting the same. We come to see
that the varieties of human behavior are not fenced off into plots. My tics and
mnemonic quirks--or yours--may not constitute a <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">syndrome</ENAMEX>, but we are not so
vastly removed from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sacks</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>, either.

            
The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Island of the Colorblind</ENAMEX> is a quite
different kind of book, even if it could be superficially described as
consisting of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> case studies. The cases in question both occur in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Micronesia</ENAMEX>:
a concentration of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">congenital achromatopsia</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pingelap</ENAMEX>, one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Caroline</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Islands</ENAMEX>; and the occurrence among a stratum of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guam</ENAMEX> of a
disease called lytico-bodig, which can take forms resembling <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Parkinson's</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">amyotrophic lateral sclerosis</ENAMEX> ("<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Lou Gehrig's disease</ENAMEX>"), or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Alzheimer's</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">disease</ENAMEX>--or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two or all three</NUMEX> in combination. While these ailments and those
affected by them are described by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sacks</ENAMEX> with his habitual sympathy and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">imagination</ENAMEX>, the real subject of the book is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Micronesia</ENAMEX> itself, and in
particular its <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flora</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sacks</ENAMEX>'
writing has many charms, among them an avuncular presence, an unaffected
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">storyteller</ENAMEX>'s voice not often found in popularized science writing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these days</TIMEX>.
In this book <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sacks</ENAMEX> makes it clear how much this owes to the works he read as a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>, how the passion, clarity, and warmth of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Victorian</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">botanists</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">zoologists</ENAMEX>--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Darwin</ENAMEX> above all--formed his imagination. For him, botany was the
road not taken, and here he indulges his continuing interest. But it is not his
ostensible subject, so he relegates much of what he has to say about
<ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX>--among other things--to frequent, lengthy, and digressive notes. These
appear in the back of the volume, making it necessary to read the thing with
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> bookmarks. While this might sound unwieldy, it soon establishes its own
rhythm.

            In any case, the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> in question and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flora</ENAMEX> in the
margins are intrinsically connected, the tissue being the nature of the islands
themselves. The congenital <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">colorblindness</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pingelap</ENAMEX> is a direct result of the
place's isolation and its vulnerability to natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cataclysm</ENAMEX>--it was a storm
that decimated the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> and enforced inbreeding, causing a
recessive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> to flourish. The origins of lytico-bodig on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guam</ENAMEX> are still
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mysterious</ENAMEX> (as is the fact that, apparently, no one born after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1950 or so</TIMEX> has
been afflicted); there are many theories afloat, one of them involving the
culinary use of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX> of the cycad, a genus of fernlike shrub that is among
the oldest forms of life on the planet.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sacks</ENAMEX>' informed curiosity
about the causes of the disease (which might hold a clue to the unsolved
mysteries surrounding its Western <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX>) is hardly separable from his
affection for the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>. At <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> point, he is so taken by a large cycad cone
that, "intrigued by the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost</NUMEX>-animal warmth of the cone, I hugged it,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">impulsively</ENAMEX>, and almost vanished in a large cloud of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pollen</ENAMEX>." This is comical,
and he knows it, but it is also characteristic of the love and wonder he feels
for the myriad adaptations of life, especially its most wayward forms.

            
               The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Island of the</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Colorblind</ENAMEX> is an odd book, part case study, part travelogue, part weave of
digressions, but this oddness is a measure of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personality</ENAMEX> that unifies it.
It also reflects the fact that the islands are the subject here, in both the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">literary</ENAMEX> and the clinical sense of the word, and that <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flora</ENAMEX>, and
topography are all essential and inseparable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">constituents</ENAMEX> of their dossier.
Sacks allows the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> to browse at will among the curio-filled cabinets of
his mind. This openness is what makes him such a sympathetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observer</ENAMEX> of
others, and also what can best persuade the apprehensive lay <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">science</ENAMEX> expresses the very highest imagination.
