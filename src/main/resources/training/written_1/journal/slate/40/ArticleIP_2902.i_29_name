            "I always feel I am a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">traveler</ENAMEX>," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vincent van Gogh</ENAMEX> wrote from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arles</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1888</TIMEX>, "going somewhere
and to some destination." <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Van Gogh</ENAMEX> wandered around <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> more rootlessly than
his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> and sometime <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">roommate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Gauguin</ENAMEX>, who could make a nifty domestic
nest for himself even in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Seas</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Van Gogh</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">preacher</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX>, born in a
dismal <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holland</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1853</TIMEX> and dead of a self-inflicted <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pistol</ENAMEX> shot to the
chest <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37 years later</TIMEX>, never stayed put. He ran through several careers during
his <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">20s</NUMEX>--art <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealer</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hague</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">schoolteacher</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX>, missionary to coal
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">miners</ENAMEX> in southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Belgium</ENAMEX>--before settling on the least secure one of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painter</ENAMEX>.
This restlessness helps explain his obsessive and often hallucinatory
depictions, from his first pictures to his last, of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX>. "Looking
at the picture ought to rest the brain," he told his younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealer</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Theo</ENAMEX>, referring to his famous painting of his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedroom</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arles</ENAMEX> ( The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bedroom</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1888</TIMEX>). The picture, a perennial favorite on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dorm</NUMEX>-room walls, may
look like a refuge, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">van Gogh</ENAMEX> had lost faith in such earthly habitations.
The gorgeous golden bed with its heavy white pillow squeezed right from the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tube</ENAMEX> already feels elegiac. Empty bed, empty chairs, no <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vincent</ENAMEX>, no <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul</ENAMEX>.

            While the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">van Gogh Museum</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> gets a facelift and a new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX>, the heart of its
collection (including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Bedroom</ENAMEX> ) is on display, like the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> crown
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">jewels</ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Seventy</TIMEX> paintings have been culled from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">roughly 200</NUMEX>
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> treasure trove--the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">van Gogh</ENAMEX> family collection, passed on from
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vincent to Theo</ENAMEX> and eventually housed in an extraordinarily popular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1973</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Gallery</ENAMEX> has opted for the kind of bank-vault presentation,
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or two pictures per plush wall, that worked so well for its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vermeer</ENAMEX> show
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three years ago</TIMEX>. This devotional approach seemed right for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vermeer</ENAMEX>: so few
paintings, scattered far and wide, gathered here for once in a lifetime. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Van</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gogh</ENAMEX> calls for a different treatment, it seems to me, one that places him more
firmly in his time and place and acknowledges his spirited engagement with
literature and popular culture.

            But "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Van Gogh</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Van Goghs</ENAMEX>" is an old-fashioned show that
surveys the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX>'s chronological development as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painter</ENAMEX>, grouping the
pictures according to where and when in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">van Gogh</ENAMEX>'s nomadic life they were
painted. The show advances no bold new perspective on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">van Gogh</ENAMEX>, nor does it
seek to synthesize recent thinking on him, of which, it should be said, there
isn't much. (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Van Gogh</ENAMEX> is not a hot commodity in academic art criticism right
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">now</TIMEX>.) The modest aim of the exhibition and the catalog is to refocus our
attention on the paintings as paintings, directing our attention to how van
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gogh</ENAMEX> made changes in color, brushstroke, and the dimensions of his pictures
over time. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">curators</ENAMEX> have understandably shied away from the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lust for Life</ENAMEX> myth of the tormented, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-eared <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX> triumphing in art
but failing in life. They give <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">van Gogh</ENAMEX>'s madness a shorthand dismissal worthy
of an HMO: "several seizures, probably caused by a form of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">epilepsy</ENAMEX>." But van
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gogh</ENAMEX>'s unsteady temperament comes through anyway. A roomful of self-portraits,
with changing identities worthy of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cindy Sherman</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">van Gogh</ENAMEX> as citified dandy in
pink fedora; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">van Gogh</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> yokel in straw hat), implies a sort of plural
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">van Gogh</ENAMEX>, a chameleon personality hard to pin down. And the late paintings
retain their unsettling power. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Meyer Schapiro</ENAMEX> looked at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wheatfield</ENAMEX> With
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Crows</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 1890</TIMEX>), he saw it as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">van Gogh</ENAMEX>'s "deepest avowal," the tortured
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX>'s "defense against disintegration" painted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few days</TIMEX> before his death.
The oncoming zigzag crows, swarming like the black choppers in Apocalypse
Now , are for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schapiro</ENAMEX> "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">figures</ENAMEX> of death." Once you've read <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schapiro</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">classic</ENAMEX> and deeply felt essay, it's hard to see this picture as anything other
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">than van Gogh</ENAMEX>'s farewell to the world, his scrawled suicide note. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kendall</ENAMEX>, in his dispassionate exhibition catalog essay, points out that maybe
this wasn't (as tradition has it) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">van Gogh</ENAMEX>'s last painting, and that the
picture looks pretty cheerful anyway. He concludes that it "might ... be seen
as a celebration of the love for 'art and life' professed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painter</ENAMEX> in one
of his final letters to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Theo</ENAMEX>." Maybe, but what about those crows?

            
By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1890</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">van Gogh</ENAMEX> had pretty much banished
black from his palette. Those crows have escaped from an earlier phase of his
career, the sepulchral, black-coffee interior of his first major picture,
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Potato Eaters</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1885</TIMEX>). We dutifully note (as the wall panel instructs
us to) "the somber colors and thick application of paint" and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">van Gogh</ENAMEX>'s remark
that "these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> ... have dug the earth with the self-same hands they are now
putting into the dish." And yet, what a weird painting. Seeing the picture in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> brings out something I've always felt about this image: that the
figures, especially the young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> to the left wearing what appears to be a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Union Army</ENAMEX> hat, look like caricatures of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African-Americans</ENAMEX>.

            Strangely
enough, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">van Gogh</ENAMEX> was a passionate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Uncle Tom's Cabin</ENAMEX> ; we find
him in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1880</TIMEX> reading <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dickens</ENAMEX> and "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beecher Stowe</ENAMEX>." <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A year</TIMEX> later
he is still mulling over the book, in which "the most beautiful passage" is
where "the poor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">slave</ENAMEX>, knowing that he must die, and sitting for the last time
with his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>, remembers the words 'Let Cares like a wild deluge come/ <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">And</ENAMEX>
storms of sorrow fall,/ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX> I but safely reach my home,/ My God, my Heaven, my
all.' " "This is far from theology," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">van Gogh</ENAMEX> concludes, "simply a fact that
the poorest little <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wood</ENAMEX>-cutter or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peasant</ENAMEX> on the heath or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">miner</ENAMEX> can have
moments of emotion and inspiration which give him a feeling of an eternal home
to which he is near." Here <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">van Gogh</ENAMEX> explicitly links the plight of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peasants</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">slaves</ENAMEX>, and pictures such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Potato Eaters</ENAMEX> may
have meant to suggest that equation.

            For this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painter</ENAMEX> who once claimed to be "daffy with piety,"
our earthly habitation, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">slave</ENAMEX> cabin, or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peasant</ENAMEX> hovel is merely temporary.
That's the message of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Potato Eaters</ENAMEX> , with its little glinting lamp
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">illuminating</ENAMEX> the darkness and its loaded juxtaposition on the background wall
of ticking clock and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Crucifixion</ENAMEX>, time and eternity. The early A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Pair</ENAMEX> of
Shoes (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1885</TIMEX>) reeks of some of that same piety. This painting inspired
several paragraphs of purple prose from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin Heidegger</ENAMEX>, when the old <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Nazi</ENAMEX> was
holed up in his thatched cottage in the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Black Forest</ENAMEX> after the war, thinking
about "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Origin of the Work of Art</ENAMEX>." "From the dark opening of the worn
insides of the shoes the toilsome tread of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX> stares forth. ... Under
the soles slides the loneliness of the field-path as <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</TIMEX> falls. In the
shoes vibrates the silent call of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">earth</ENAMEX>, its quiet gift of the ripening
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">grain</ENAMEX> and its unexplained self-refusal in the fallow desolation of the wintry
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">field</ENAMEX>." I think <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">van Gogh</ENAMEX> would have loved this peasant chic. But this picture
too has a secret strangeness, which has to do with scale. The background of the
painting suggests a clearing in a landscape, with <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> in the distance. One
suddenly has the illusion that the shoes are huge, monumental. They reach out
to each other like a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> lost in the wilderness, one upright and confident,
the other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> slouched down in despair. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">A whole</TIMEX> poetry of the ordinary came out
of such images, from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walker Evans</ENAMEX>' frontal portraits of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sharecroppers</ENAMEX>' beds to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jasper Johns</ENAMEX>' deadpan brace of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ale</ENAMEX> cans.

            The one
moment in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> installation that departs from the chaste array of
paintings suggests what this show might have been, in the hands of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">curators</ENAMEX>
more interested in social context. There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> works on paper in the
show: an image of a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">geisha</ENAMEX> derived from a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">woodblock</ENAMEX> print on the cover
of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Paris Illustré of 1886</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">van Gogh</ENAMEX>'s virtuoso tracing of its
outlines. To produce his bizarre painting <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Courtesan</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1887</TIMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">van Gogh</ENAMEX>
enlarged the traced image, replaced the subdued <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> and grays of the kimono
with bright complementary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">reds</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">greens</ENAMEX>, and added a fantasy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japanese</ENAMEX>
background of storks and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">frogs</ENAMEX> borrowed from other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> prints. He
constructed this image during his confused <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1886-88</TIMEX>, when he tried
out various Impressionist styles and, except for his self-portraits, produced
work that looks half-baked.

            
But <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> represented something new for van
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gogh</ENAMEX>, not the jaggedly cropped edges and off-kilter points of view that
attracted <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Degas</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cassatt</ENAMEX> but rather an imaginary world of nature worship;
available <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>; and flat, shadowless color. It is no exaggeration to say that
when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">van Gogh</ENAMEX> escaped to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arles</ENAMEX>, he invented there his own little private <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedroom</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arles</ENAMEX>, he tells <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Theo</ENAMEX>, is "painted in the free flat tints like
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> prints." His <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Field With Flowers Near Arles</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1888</TIMEX>) is "a
little town surrounded by fields all covered with yellow and purple <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>;
exactly--can't you see it?--like a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> dream." The apotheosis of his
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> quest is the swooningly gorgeous <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Almond Blossom</ENAMEX> , painted in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February of 1890</TIMEX>. The picture, which recalls innumerable <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> prints
including one he owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Utagawa Kunisada</ENAMEX> that has been reproduced in the
catalog, has no obvious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">center</ENAMEX>. The gnarled and wonderfully drawn branches
toward the bottom break into the allover blossoms, with their red detail and
extraordinary radiating energy.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> was less a set of
technical possibilities for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">van Gogh</ENAMEX> than it was a vision, already almost
posthumous, of celestial happiness and escape. Unlike <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gauguin</ENAMEX>'s literal flight
to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tahiti</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">van Gogh</ENAMEX> didn't need to go to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> to fulfill his exotic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">yearnings</ENAMEX>.
His <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> didn't exist on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX> anyway. Lying in the insane asylum in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. Remy</ENAMEX>
after one of his seizures, he could gaze in the southern light at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japanese</ENAMEX>
prints with which he'd decorated the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX>-like flowers
blooming outside the window. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gauguin</ENAMEX> had lasted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two months</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arles</ENAMEX>, finding
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">van Gogh</ENAMEX> too intense a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">companion</ENAMEX> for comfort. But for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vincent van Gogh</ENAMEX>, in
flight from the shadowed northland, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Provence</ENAMEX> was far enough away. And anyway,
as usual, he was just passing through.
