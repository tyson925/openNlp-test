            Anyone who lived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last 40 years</TIMEX>, and whose life touched even briefly on that in<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">-</ENAMEX>town
industry of the printed word, had to have heard of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harold Brodkey</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Writer</ENAMEX> and
reputation were inseparable from the beginning, no doubt because his
self-aggrandizement dovetailed so nicely with the spirit of literary kingmakers
around <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>. It began as an explosion, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1954</TIMEX>, with the publication of his
still-astonishing collection of stories, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">First Love and Other Sorrows</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Novel</ENAMEX> was promised and promised, but it seemed as if it would never
come. There were rumors that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brodkey</ENAMEX> was getting a kind of perpetually
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">renewable</ENAMEX> advance from his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">publisher</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Farrar, Straus & Giroux</ENAMEX>. Fragments of
fiction appeared in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The New Yorker</ENAMEX> throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the '60s and '70s</TIMEX>, but
they eventually amounted not to a novel but to a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> collection, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Stories</ENAMEX>
in an <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Almost Classical Mode</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brodkey</ENAMEX> began to write an acerbic
column about life and letters for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Observer</ENAMEX> , and it was said
that this new diversion proved he would never finish the novel.

            Somehow,
when <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Runaway Soul</ENAMEX> , a novel of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 800</NUMEX> pages, finally appeared in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX>, it was an anticlimax. Though reviewed positively, it was, even its
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partisans</ENAMEX> admitted, perhaps too long, too repetitive, too fragmentary. Literary
fashion is elusive; what in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s</TIMEX> might have seemed like an apotheosis of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">modernism</ENAMEX> had, by the decidedly postmodern <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990s</TIMEX>, come to seem old hat.

            Then, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>, while he was putting the finishing touches
on his <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> novel, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Profane</ENAMEX> Friendship , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brodkey</ENAMEX> learned that he was ill
with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX>. He promptly published a declaration of his <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The New</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yorker</ENAMEX> , and, suddenly, he was as fascinating as a train wreck once again.
This <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Wild Darkness: The Story of My Death</ENAMEX> is his final book, a series of
diary essays chronicling the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</TIMEX> leading up to his death on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Jan. 26</TIMEX>,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>. An agonizing production of willful beauty, it gives the lie to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">implicitly</ENAMEX> posed question about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brodkey</ENAMEX>: megalomaniac or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genius</ENAMEX>? Because he was
both.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brodkey</ENAMEX>'s
account takes us from his discovery that he was ill with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> through his
prolonged hospital stay with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pneumonia</ENAMEX>, his decision to return <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">home</ENAMEX>, and the
slow <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX>--many in a quiet equilibrium that was not health, but not death
either--that followed. During <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this time</TIMEX>, he was able to revisit his beloved
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venice</ENAMEX> and spend a final <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> in his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">country house</ENAMEX> in upstate <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>. Even
though we know the end, the story is filled with suspense, and we turn the
pages intently. He was too great a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> not to milk the drama of his own
demise. Running parallel to the story of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>'s dying is that of his
relationship with his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ellen Schwamm Brodkey</ENAMEX>, and the mixture of deathbed
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">wit</ENAMEX>, tenderness, and sensuality the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> share. The portrait of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ellen</ENAMEX> is an
understated valentine that colors the entire book with almost inadvertent
charm.

            
The great relief here, for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> as well as
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX>, is that the fictional mask has been cast aside. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brodkey</ENAMEX>'s work was
always obviously, insistently, autobiographical--but one could get muddled
trying to decide if, for instance, this story's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">narrator</ENAMEX> from a <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">St.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis</ENAMEX> suburb was the same as that story's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">narrator</ENAMEX> from a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. Louis</ENAMEX>
suburb. Although the various narrators might sound exactly the same, they would
have different names, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX>. And then there were the confusions
among the many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Venetian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lovers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">male</ENAMEX> and female, and the mystery of the alter
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ego</ENAMEX> who directs films. These are, no doubt, parochial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concerns</ENAMEX>, but Brodkey
always seemed to be deliberately provoking the puzzlement, coyly playing
hide-and-seek with us.

            By
contrast, it seems calming to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brodkey</ENAMEX>'s voice to find itself in a "true" first
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> and a lucid present tense.

            
               Medical attention and
the horrors of death, great death, amused me in a quiet way. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amused</ENAMEX>? Well, what
do you feel when you're expected to fight an often-fatal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pneumonia</ENAMEX> and you've
been sentenced to death already? ... The connection to the ordinary world is
broken, yet not entirely. And there is a cartoon aspect: the curses people
hurled at you have come true. What do you suggest I do? Be unamused?
            

            There
is--unsurprisingly, given <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brodkey</ENAMEX>'s reputation--no shortage here of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">paranoia</ENAMEX>
and score-settling. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Brodkey</ENAMEX> often darkly refers to his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enemies</ENAMEX>: the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enemies</ENAMEX> of
his work, of his marriage--the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enemies</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genius</ENAMEX>. He manages to get one smart
crack in, writing, "I do think about suicide a lot because it is so boring to
be ill, rather like being trapped in an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Updike</ENAMEX> novel."

            There are also embarrassing--or, if you prefer,
honest--references to his being "recognized and accepted as an important
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX>," to the conviction that his "work will live" after he is gone. He chews
over his past, counts up his <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">debtors</ENAMEX>, enumerates his aches and pains, and
worries the issue of subjectivity to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone</ENAMEX>. "[A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX>] says that I am a
monstre sacr√© but I am not so famous. I am aware of the monstrosity of
my own will and of individual will in anyone," he writes. Or, again, "I believe
that the world is dying, not just me." Is all this his special megalomania, or
just garden-variety <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">egotism</ENAMEX>? Either way, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brodkey</ENAMEX> embraces a self-absorption so
extreme that it succeeds, paradoxically, in turning him into an <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Everyman</ENAMEX>:

            
               My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> is to me like a
crippled rabbit that I don't want to pet, that I forget to feed on time, that I
haven't time to play with and get to know, a useless rabbit kept in a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cage</ENAMEX> that
it would be cruel to turn loose.
            

            Brodkey
underplays the untying of an old psychological knot when he reveals details of
his childhood. His <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> died when he was young, and he was adopted by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brodkeys</ENAMEX>. His new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> became physically ill, which exacerbated their
psychological torture of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> (so much one could have gathered already
from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brodkey</ENAMEX>'s fiction). The new details in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">This Wild Darkness make</ENAMEX>
explicit the sexual abuses of his adoptive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brodkey</ENAMEX> tells us that, after
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several years</TIMEX> of unwanted fondling, "I said he could not touch me anymore, not
even a handshake, unless he behaved . ... He turned his face to the wall,
telling me I was a cold <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>--because I would not sex around with him. He was
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lecherous</ENAMEX> and strange."

            
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brodkey</ENAMEX> expresses enormous ambivalence about
his own later-life adventures in homosexuality, referring, at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> unsavory
moment, to his <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX> as "the wages of sin." While it is easy to see how
infuriating such a pose must be to others, offensiveness in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">service</ENAMEX> of
subjective truth has its place here. If not here, then where? <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brodkey</ENAMEX> is not
obliged to be a poster <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX>. Besides, in another mood, he writes, "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">It</ENAMEX>
seemed to me that I was surrounded by braveries without number, that I had been
inducted into a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">phalanx</ENAMEX> of the wildly-alive-even-if-dying, and I felt honored
that I would, so to speak, die in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> of such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>."

            On the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">page</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brodkey</ENAMEX> has always been a brilliant, egotistical talker. As a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">listener</ENAMEX>,
one is both stimulated and frustrated, longing to get a word in edgewise.
Perhaps that's why he has always seemed to want to preclude critical judgment
with pre-emptive strikes within his prose, anticipating our responses and
silencing us. He does that here, too, but with a somewhat milder air: "I think
what I think, and the hell with the rest of it, the rest of you; you don't
actually exist for me anyway--you're all myths in my head." Perhaps the
absoluteness of the act of writing, in effect, his own elegy--and the
absoluteness of his inability to answer his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> afterward--curiously
mellowed him.

            It turns out to be surprisingly easy to get past the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">whining</ENAMEX> and the nonsense about fame. And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brodkey</ENAMEX>'s strenuous feats of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">observation</ENAMEX> and language, in the teeth of death, more than repay the
effort:

            
               At <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time I was
interested in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bird</ENAMEX>-watching, and I noticed that when I saw a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bird</ENAMEX> for the first
time I couldn't really see it, because I had no formal arrangement, no sense of
pattern, for it. ... But once I identified the bird, the drawings in bird books
and my own sense of order arranged the image, and made it clearer to me, and I
never forgot it. From then on I could see the bird in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> ways--as the fresh,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">unpatterned</ENAMEX> vision and the patterned <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>. Well, seeing death nearby is very
like the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> way of seeing.
            

            What can one do with
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brodkey</ENAMEX>'s gift of his own death, given in a manner at once casual and shocking?
Receive it with gratitude.
