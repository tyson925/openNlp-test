            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis Begley</ENAMEX>'s work is like
a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bibliographer</ENAMEX>'s idea of nostalgia: Everything has been downhill since the
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> book. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Begley</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> novel, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wartime Lies</ENAMEX> , was a work of great
distinction. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> novels later, it is still his best, a marvel of achieved
restraint. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Unhappily</ENAMEX>, the subsequent novels have been unwitting examples of the
difficulty of writing about restraint as a subject. About <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schmidt</ENAMEX> , his
new book which explores the dwindling years of a morose retired <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX>, a man
who calls himself "the last of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wasps</ENAMEX>," offers some of his most delicate
writing yet, but once again involves <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Begley</ENAMEX> in the paradoxical task of giving
expression to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">repression</ENAMEX>.

            

               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wartime Lies</ENAMEX>, which is largely autobiographical, recounts the adventures
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maciek</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> who, with his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aunt</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tania</ENAMEX>, is fleeing the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Nazis</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> do not look <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX>, and this, combined with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tania</ENAMEX>'s charm,
enables them to evade capture, even as they live openly <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">yards</NUMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Warsaw</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ghetto</ENAMEX>. Nonetheless, they are in great peril, and are hiding from that peril.
By contrast, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Begley</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> novel, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Man Who Was Late</ENAMEX> , is about a man
who is hiding a secret. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ben</ENAMEX> is a successful <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">financier</ENAMEX> who has
repressed the memory of his unhappy <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> childhood. What mysteriously
disappeared, from one book to the next, is a sense of the perilous. It is as if
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Begley</ENAMEX> could no longer identify the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enemy</ENAMEX>. In this novel and his <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX>, As
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Max Saw It</ENAMEX> , his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> are still hiding, but now they are hiding from
themselves. It is this self-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX> that seems to defy lucid expression. The
secrecy is more opaque than it appears to warrant.

            A>bout <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schmidt</ENAMEX> is a better book than its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">predecessors</ENAMEX>, partly because of the honesty of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albert Schmidt</ENAMEX>'s
self-disclosures. There is clarity here; he hides nothing from us. Publicly, he
maintains the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wasp</ENAMEX> proprieties--a stiff upper lip, a stiff drink, the rattle of
small talk. But privately, his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soul</ENAMEX> is in turmoil. Essentially, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schmidt</ENAMEX>
narrates this novel (the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX>-person <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">narrator</ENAMEX> hews closely to his point of
view); in the process, he uncovers his own hurts. His only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Charlotte</ENAMEX>,
is marrying one of his former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">junior partners</ENAMEX> from the old law <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jon Riker</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schmidt</ENAMEX> thinks him dull and laborious and, with the kind of bigotry that is the
fermentation of social vintage, disapproves of his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jewishness</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schmidt</ENAMEX> is also
still in mourning for his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>. His <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> seems to be cleaving to the Riker
family rather than to her sad <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>. He kicks old memories around his lovely
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">house</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bridgehampton</ENAMEX>--a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> that he tries to give to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Charlotte</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jon</ENAMEX>, but
that they ungraciously refuse. At <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX>, his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> is cooling, and even the heat of
an affair with a dangerously young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">waitress</ENAMEX> at a local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX> will not warm
him for long.

            What is
fine here is the precision of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Begley</ENAMEX>'s attention; he does not strive to make
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schmidt</ENAMEX> either likable or a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">monster</ENAMEX>. He paints with care the natural
variegation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schmidt</ENAMEX>'s petty anti-Semitism, its defiance on top, its
embarrassment under-leaf: "To the best of his recollection, no matter how
deeply or how far back he looked, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schmidt</ENAMEX> was sure he had not once in his life
stood in the way of any <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jew</ENAMEX>." <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schmidt</ENAMEX>'s codes of belonging, his fastidious
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">prejudices</ENAMEX>, are laid bare. In sentences of loping, baroque syntax, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Begley</ENAMEX> makes
his elegant, stately report. There is something impressive about a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> so
undaunted by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX>'s trivial unpleasantness, by his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">daily</ENAMEX> acts of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">meanness</ENAMEX>.

            
But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">About Schmidt</ENAMEX> loses delicacy as it
proceeds. Its power flows from its fidelity to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schmidt</ENAMEX>'s unhappiness, and this
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">unhappiness</ENAMEX> has a reality only because we see how self-invented it is.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schmidt</ENAMEX>'s selfishness is the most convincing element of this portrait. But then
Begley cheats; he weights our sympathy in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schmidt</ENAMEX>'s favor. His <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> becomes
not merely ungrateful but implausibly hostile. In a climactic scene, she
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">telephones Schmidt</ENAMEX> to tell him that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rabbi</ENAMEX> will be performing the wedding
service, and that she will be converting. "There must be more to being a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jew</ENAMEX>
than your kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Episcopalian</ENAMEX>," she sneers. Since she has not, until <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this</TIMEX>
moment, shown interest one way or another in her inherited religion, her sudden
zeal to abandon it seems clumsy on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Begley</ENAMEX>'s part. Meanwhile, her fianc√©, who is
interestingly dull at the beginning of the book, begins to curdle into
uninteresting stereotype--the dry, ruthless <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> poised to strip the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">in-law</ENAMEX> of his treasures. He is abetted by his beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">psychoanalyst mother</ENAMEX>,
Renata, who is also crudely drawn: Like some caricature of a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Freudian</ENAMEX>, she has
an urge to psychoanalyze <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schmidt</ENAMEX> whenever he is in her presence. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schmidt</ENAMEX> quotes
from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">King Lear</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Begley</ENAMEX> intends a soft echo of that play in his tale
of an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">aged</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patriarch</ENAMEX> quarreling with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX>. But what's interesting about
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">King Lear</ENAMEX> is that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lear</ENAMEX> has no reason to blame his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughters</ENAMEX>: Their
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">villainy</ENAMEX> is all in his head. The obviousness of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Charlotte</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jon</ENAMEX>'s evil
leaches the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> from the story. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Begley</ENAMEX> wants us to feel pity for a man
already swimming in the emotion.

            As <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Begley</ENAMEX> loses his critical
distance from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schmidt</ENAMEX>, the novel grows maudlin and bleary. Clannishly, Begley
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">offers Schmidt</ENAMEX> sexual release. He romps with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renata</ENAMEX>, and then with a
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">waitress</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carrie</ENAMEX>, who is so eager to have sex with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> 40
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years her</TIMEX> senior that she begs for it. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jamesian</ENAMEX> upholstery is ripped off
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Begley</ENAMEX>'s prose, and we are down to springs and horsehair: "I haven't seen your
breasts. I think they are small and hard," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schmidt</ENAMEX> muses. "You're wrong. I've
got big tits," she replies. Then <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schmidt</ENAMEX> retreats from us, lost in a cloth that
Begley throws over him, and what began as a sharp examination of public
restraint and private release dwindles into a self-pity which seems not merely
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schmidt's</ENAMEX>, but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Begley's</ENAMEX>.

            Repression is one of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Begley</ENAMEX>'s main themes. But his latest novels do more than just showcase it; they
become its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX>. It is difficult not to detect an autobiographical note in
his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heroes</ENAMEX>' struggle to control inner distress and bury forgotten memories.
Even <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wartime Lies</ENAMEX> , apparently so different from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Begley</ENAMEX>'s later work, is
introduced by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who "has no childhood that he can bear to remember." In the
last <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> pages of this novel, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schmidt</ENAMEX>'s struggle to control himself fades from
view, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">suspects</ENAMEX> that it is a struggle <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Begley</ENAMEX> can no longer depict,
because it is a struggle he can no longer win. Instead, he shuts it down, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schmidt</ENAMEX> dissolves into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Begley</ENAMEX>'s anxious obscurity.
