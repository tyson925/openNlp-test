            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">About 15 years ago</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painter</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chuck Close</ENAMEX> went out to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Springs</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Long Island</ENAMEX>, to meet <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Willem de Kooning</ENAMEX>, one of
the greatest <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this century</TIMEX>. As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Close</ENAMEX> describes him, de
Kooning was a wreck. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stooped</ENAMEX> and vacant-eyed, shuffling around in pajamas, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aged artist</ENAMEX> couldn't identify <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> or participate in conversation. He
drifted away from his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guests</ENAMEX> to the television, where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Close</ENAMEX> found him channel
surfing, staring at the procession of silent images as they blinked past, his
once-legendary attention span splintered into nothingness.

            Before
Close left, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Kooning</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elaine</ENAMEX>, suggested that Bill show Close his
recent paintings. Nervously, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Close</ENAMEX> followed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Kooning</ENAMEX> into the famous
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hangarlike</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">studio</ENAMEX>. As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Kooning</ENAMEX> crossed the threshold, a transformation took
place. He straightened up. His eyes brightened. He began speaking articulately
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about</NUMEX> each of the paintings in turn. He modeled the air with his hands, making
the beautiful, precise gestures that earlier <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> had described. He was
himself.

            Or rather, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Close</ENAMEX> realized, he was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> selves: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">De Kooning</ENAMEX>
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> had long since disintegrated. Asked a factual question, he was
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">helpless</ENAMEX>, ignorant of the date, of where he lived. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Kooning</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX>
was still healthy. He would continue to paint for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nearly a decade</TIMEX>, long after
he had lost the ability to sign his own name.

            Some
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> see these late paintings as flaccid and incontinent--channel surfing on
canvas. Others think they document the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">de Kooning</ENAMEX> whom <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Close</ENAMEX> saw in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">studio</ENAMEX>:
an old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> still young in his art. The paintings themselves have rarely been
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">exhibited</ENAMEX>. But <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> of them, beautifully installed at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York City</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum of</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Modern Art</ENAMEX>, now make it possible to judge the case for oneself. Whatever one's
opinion of the paintings' success, they tell a poignant story of resilience and
frailty, and of an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX> who was passionately unwilling to put away his
brushes.

            
The story begins at a low point in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">de Kooning</ENAMEX>'s
life. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1979</TIMEX>, at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 75</TIMEX>, with his short-term memory already failing, de
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kooning</ENAMEX> quit drinking and entered a period of lethargy and depression. It
looked as if his most recent works would be his last. Those works were large,
oceanic abstractions that incorporated a kaleidoscopic range of color. Like
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CÃ©zanne</ENAMEX>'s last views of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mont</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sainte Victoire</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monet</ENAMEX>'s water lilies, they had
the slightly incoherent grandeur often associated with an altersstil , an
old-age style. But when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Kooning</ENAMEX> pulled himself together and began painting
again in earnest, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1981</TIMEX>, his paintings looked unlike anything he had made
before.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Untitled I</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1981</TIMEX>),
the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> painting in this show, is a transitional work, a preamble to the new
style. Using masonry <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">knives</ENAMEX> and pieces of cardboard instead of brushes, de
Kooning smears paint across the canvas as if it were <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spackle</ENAMEX>. The resulting
swaths of color, like beach towels rippling on a laundry line, create a planar
kind of abstraction, with large areas of smooth, erased whiteness. His palette,
once so full of nuanced colors, here shrinks to play-school primaries, colors
that refer to nothing but paint. Both changes signal a stripping down, an old
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">man</ENAMEX>'s effort to simplify, relearn, restart.

            In the
next painting, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pirate</ENAMEX> (also <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1981</TIMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">de Kooning</ENAMEX> picks up his brushes again. But he
uses them in an uncharacteristic way. The <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">strokes</ENAMEX> are isolated and tentative,
gliding over the smooth paint surface like someone ice-skating <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> after a
cast comes off. In <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Untitled III</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1981</TIMEX>), a scattering of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">snail</ENAMEX>-shaped
blue brush strokes have been cropped and re-contoured. Their streamlined edges
help create a new mood in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">de Kooning</ENAMEX>'s art, one of delicacy, radiance, and
calm.

            For many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, such calmness amounted to a betrayal. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">De</ENAMEX>
Kooning was, after all, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX> for whom the term "action painting" had been
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> coined. Explosive splashes and drips were supposed to be integral to his
art, proof of the painting's volcanic authenticity. I remember, in art <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>,
watching otherwise mild-mannered <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> hyperventilate, grimace, and lunge at
their canvases, trying desperately to imitate <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Kooning</ENAMEX>'s slashing gestures.
Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> still subscribe to this view of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Kooning</ENAMEX> as a kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dutch</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dervish</ENAMEX>. Writing recently in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The New Yorker</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Calvin Tompkins</ENAMEX> complained
that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1980s</TIMEX> paintings lacked the "messy viscous slathers of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pigment</ENAMEX>, the
turbulence and turmoil, ... the sheer velocity of a style that allowed no room
for refinement and contemplation." To <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tompkins</ENAMEX>, these weren't just surface
effects, but "the essential elements of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Kooning</ENAMEX>'s greatness."

            <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Forty</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years before</TIMEX>, similar complaints had been leveled. His grotesque, sardonic
"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Woman</ENAMEX>" paintings were seen as a betrayal of his earlier abstract phase. Today
this controversy is a dead issue. The abstractions and the "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Woman</ENAMEX>" paintings
hang side by side in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX>. My bet is that the current objections will prove
equally temporary. As the unfamiliarity of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early-'80s</TIMEX> paintings wears off,
a new, amended sense of continuity will emerge. Our eyes will focus not on
velocity but on volatility, on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Kooning</ENAMEX>'s ability to make his images wriggle
and buckle, never quite settling into the seat belt of a single compositional
scheme.

            
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">De Kooning</ENAMEX>'s best paintings, from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the '40s</TIMEX> as
well as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early '80s</TIMEX>, flirt with refinement and turbulence. They avoid the
ideological options--an anarchic expressionism or traditional composition.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Delicacy</ENAMEX> doesn't undermine this balancing act. A greater sense of control
seems, on the contrary, to highlight it. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">favorites</ENAMEX> among these
paintings, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Untitled V</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1982</TIMEX>), is built around a repeated shape that is like
a dark letter "S." But "repeated" isn't an accurate description here, since the
shape is never the same twice. It bends, tilts, swells, enlarges, and shrinks
in each new appearance, like a vacuum <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX> full of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">snakes</ENAMEX>. In the center of
the picture, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> asymmetrical oxbows form a configuration like a grappling
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">iron</ENAMEX>, anchoring the composition. The sense of order here is slight, but it's
enough to give the picture a momentary, precarious unity. To my eye, this is
the essential <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Kooning</ENAMEX>: not a slatherer but a destabilizer. He creates a kind
of equilibrium that is always mobile, always about to tilt off to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> side and
disappear.

            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1982</TIMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">'83 de Kooning</ENAMEX>, undistracted by an outside world he could no longer
understand, painted at an unprecedented pace, completing nearly a picture a
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week</TIMEX>. His fat serpentine <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">strokes</ENAMEX> and lacquer-smooth <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planes</ENAMEX> twisted around each
other, arriving at exuberant new combinations that sometimes echoed his old
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">friend Arshile Gorky</ENAMEX> as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henri Matisse</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Piet Mondrian</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painters</ENAMEX> whose
final work was similarly buoyant. This brief period may have been the most
fertile of his career.

            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1984</TIMEX>, however, the paintings changed again, marking the
start of decline. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">De Kooning</ENAMEX> continued to paint rapidly, but now he seemed to
be able to juggle fewer elements. Stretching his paint strokes into long,
narrow ribbons, he retreated toward a kind of linear drawing in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> colors.
The paintings became sinuous lattices, like the web of a deranged and brilliant
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">spider</ENAMEX>. Within them, an endless inventory of shapes and rhythms appears. The
compositions become ever more undulating and graceful. But at this point the
difference between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supporters</ENAMEX>' and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">detractors</ENAMEX>' views begins to narrow. The
pictures' precariousness, their <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Kooningness</ENAMEX>, has unmistakably begun to leak
away.

            Gradually, the paintings
exhibit a restriction in emotional range as well. They take on a cartoonish,
uniform cheeriness. The paintings from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</TIMEX> are full of charming <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX>, but
their decorativeness is repetitive. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">De Kooning</ENAMEX> himself seems to have left the
room.

            Still alive at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">93</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Kooning</ENAMEX>
is now neither <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX> nor channel surfer. Immobilized by <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Alzheimer's disease</ENAMEX>,
he sits in his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Springs</ENAMEX>, having lived beyond what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Auden</ENAMEX> called "his last
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> as himself."
