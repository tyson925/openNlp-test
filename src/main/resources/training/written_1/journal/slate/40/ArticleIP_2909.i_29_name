            "I look like a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX>," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edgar</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Degas</ENAMEX> remarked of a pastel self-portrait made when he was in his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 60s</TIMEX>, a
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">century ago</TIMEX>. Hunched forward in a coarse <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painter</ENAMEX>'s smock, he peers forlornly at
us, his tired and damaged eyes rimmed with vermilion. What appears, at first
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">glance</ENAMEX>, to be a genie rising from his soft brown cap turns out, on closer
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inspection</ENAMEX>, to be the sinuous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> and towel, in white chalk, of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Degas</ENAMEX>'
own bathers, a pastel within a pastel. For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Degas</ENAMEX>, who had forsworn
self-portraiture for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30 years</TIMEX>, this double image has the weight of allegory:
The aging and celibate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX> has purchased a score of creative <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> at the
price of physical collapse.

            The
portrait captures a fraught moment in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Degas</ENAMEX>' career, when he had lost interest
in the witty chronicle of modern life he'd pursued with such brilliance for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>--the parade of shopgirls and laundresses and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">jockeys</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prostitutes</ENAMEX> that
had made him famous. The last of the impressionist exhibitions, in which Degas
had played so central a role, was held in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1886</TIMEX>; afterward, he found himself
increasingly isolated as well. "I am quickly sliding downhill," he confided to
an acquaintance at the time, "rolling I know not where, wrapped up in lots of
bad pastels as if in so much packing paper."

            It turned out to be a long hill. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Degas</ENAMEX> lived until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1917</TIMEX>,
when--blind, brittle, and beleaguered--he died at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">82</NUMEX>. The surprising premise of
the current exhibition at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Art Institute of Chicago</ENAMEX> is that much of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Degas</ENAMEX>'
most challenging and inventive work dates from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1890s and the first years</TIMEX> of
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this century</TIMEX>. Printed in bold letters at the entrance of the show is a
startling claim by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Degas</ENAMEX>' fellow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painter</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Auguste Renoir</ENAMEX>: "If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Degas</ENAMEX> had died at
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX>, he would have been remembered as an excellent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painter</ENAMEX>, no more; it is after
his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50 th year</TIMEX> that his work broadened out and that he really becomes
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Degas</ENAMEX>."

            While the
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> part of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Renoir</ENAMEX>'s assertion is preposterous (as anyone can see who peruses
the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozen or so</NUMEX> early works, culled from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Art Institute</ENAMEX>'s own spectacular
collection of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 90</NUMEX> pieces by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Degas</ENAMEX>, that serve as an appetizer for the
exhibition), the show makes a convincing case for the vitality of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Degas</ENAMEX>' late
work. Holed up in his squalid <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">attic studio</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Montmartre</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> complained of
the dust, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Degas</ENAMEX> believed that sweeping just moved the dust around), Degas
narrowed his subject matter to a few recurrent motifs--<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> bathing, having
their hair combed, and dancing--while at the same time experimenting with a
remarkable range of techniques and media (photography, tracing paper, lurid
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">color</ENAMEX> combinations). Many of his forays "beyond impressionism," as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">curators</ENAMEX>
point out, anticipate some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">titans</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">20 th</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-century</TIMEX> art.

            
Amorbid undertow pervades the early <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> of
the exhibition--apparent in the blank gaze, for instance, of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">H√©l√®ne</ENAMEX> Rouart
in Her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Father</ENAMEX>'s Study (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">c. 1893-'98</ENAMEX>), one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Degas</ENAMEX>' last and finest
portraits. Draped over an empty chair, the subject's expressive hands could be
playing the piano or summoning up the ghost of her recently deceased <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>,
whose stacks of papers and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Egyptian</ENAMEX> funerary art hem her in. A frieze of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dancers</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">c. 1893-'98</ENAMEX>) with gray-white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX>, their faces daubed with green and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">orange</ENAMEX>, look like they've just stepped out of a grave--or a badly colorized
film. And indeed, there's something almost cinematic in the similar poses of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dancers</ENAMEX> as they adjust their shoes, like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eadweard Muybridge</ENAMEX>'s freeze frames
of bodies in motion, with which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Degas</ENAMEX> was familiar.

            Those green and orange faces
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">presage Degas</ENAMEX>' growing interest in bright color in his later work. Always
curious about technological innovation, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Degas</ENAMEX> may have been excited by the new
colors made available by the chemical industry at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">century's end</TIMEX>. Alternatively,
the bold hues might have resulted from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Degas</ENAMEX>' wretched eyesight (those <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oranges</ENAMEX>
may not have looked so bright to him ), which forced him to wear tinted
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">glasses</ENAMEX> and keep his brown-walled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">studio</ENAMEX> (reproduced in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Art Institute</ENAMEX>'s
brown walls) in a spectral gloom.

            In any
case, little that has come before prepares the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewer</ENAMEX> for the visual shock of
the outsized <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Combing the Hair</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">c. 1892-'96</ENAMEX>). The gestures of the two
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, an attendant combing the long coil of her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mistress</ENAMEX>'s hair, have a
ritualized simplicity. A single brushstroke enlarges the reclining <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stomach</ENAMEX>, indicating her pregnancy. The whole composition is rendered in
pulsating shades of red. It seems fitting that this remarkable painting was
owned for a time by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henri Matisse</ENAMEX>, who experimented with similar monochromatic
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">harmonies</ENAMEX>. Those amniotic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">reds recur</ENAMEX> in the wrenched <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> of the nude figure in
After the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bath</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Woman Drying Herself</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">c. 1894-'96</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Degas</ENAMEX> based the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">composition</ENAMEX>, so suggestive of pain and isolation, on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of his own
photographs, a medium in which he'd begun to experiment around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1895</TIMEX>.

            Degas was drawn to other methods besides photography for
recycling his images, using tracing paper to multiply a drawing, then
overlaying the copies with different colors to produce a range of emotional
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variants</ENAMEX>. A particularly bizarre transformation occurred when he made a
charcoal copy of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> having her hair combed. He rotated the image
<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">90 degrees</NUMEX>, overlaid it with vigorous layers of pastel, and produced a
perfectly convincing landscape, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Steep Coast</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">c. 1890-'92</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>'s
cascading hair becomes a cliff plummeting to the ocean below, while her breasts
and upraised knees are hills. The riddling result, judging from the "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Ah</ENAMEX>"s and
"Oh, yeah!"s of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX>, is as satisfying as the "hidden pictures" from a
Highlights <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dentist</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>. What the picture "means"--a
dubious equation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> and nature? the virgin land?--is a further
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">enigma</ENAMEX>.

            In
focusing the show almost entirely on technique, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">organizers</ENAMEX> of "Degas:
Beyond Impressionism" have followed the lead of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Degas</ENAMEX> himself, who steadily
eliminated from his work any reference to contemporary life, preferring an
artificial world of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">studio</ENAMEX> props and pliable <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX>. "There is something
artificial even about this heart of mine," he wrote in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1886</TIMEX>. "The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dancers</ENAMEX> have
sewn it into a pink satin bag, a slightly faded satin, like their ballet
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">slippers</ENAMEX>." One is lulled into thinking that these contorted bathers are mere
exercises in the handling of pastel, and not the work of, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Val√©ry</ENAMEX>'s words, "a supremely cruel <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authority</ENAMEX> on female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contours</ENAMEX> and poses." A
firestorm of feminist controversy already surrounds some of these works--one
side contends that these are refreshingly de-idealized nudes, the other side
responds that the unusual poses and aggressive use of pastel are further
degradations of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>--but you wouldn't know it from the placid audio tour, or
from the printed "exhibition guide" that replaces the usual wall panels.

            
More surprisingly, there is not a single
mention of the most important public event for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Degas</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1890s</TIMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dreyfus</ENAMEX> affair, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Degas</ENAMEX> didn't just look like a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> but behaved like one,
cutting off <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> of long standing and adamantly insisting (along with
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul C√</ENAMEX>©zanne and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Renoir</ENAMEX>) on the guilt of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> army <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> falsely
accused of treason. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> must turn to the informative catalog, by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guest curator</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Kendall</ENAMEX>, to learn something of this unsavory episode in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Degas</ENAMEX>' life, a
further lesson that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">avant-garde art</ENAMEX> and retrograde politics often coexist.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Degas</ENAMEX>' very retreat from contemporary life owes something to his disgust with
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> society as he found it.

            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Next year</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Art Institute</ENAMEX>
will try for an impressionist hat trick, as they add a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Renoir</ENAMEX> show to the
successes of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">extravaganza</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX>'s subtler and more
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">demanding Degas</ENAMEX>. As boating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> replace ballerinas on the T-shirts and
umbrellas for sale along <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Michigan Avenue</ENAMEX>, the exhibition <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">organizers</ENAMEX> shouldn't
shy away from social context and controversy. They can afford to risk a bit
more grit in the presentation.
