            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Division</ENAMEX> runs like a seam
through the biography of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Nobel</ENAMEX> Prize-winning <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX>-born <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Derek</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walcott</ENAMEX>--his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">task</ENAMEX> has been to make it more boon than burden. He and his twin
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roderick</ENAMEX>, were born in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1930</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">St.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lucia</ENAMEX>, a small link in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Antilles</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">island</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX>, then part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British West Indies</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walcott</ENAMEX>'s was a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">education</ENAMEX>. The paucity of books in his native <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">St.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lucia</ENAMEX> led, paradoxically, to
an excellent literary education grounded in the heavily accented rhythms of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglican</ENAMEX> hymnal, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Bible</ENAMEX>.

            Even as
he pursued a college education, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walcott</ENAMEX> absorbed the parallel oral culture of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX>, particularly audible in his plays, some of which adopt his
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">native Creole</ENAMEX> dialect. His early poems register both geographical distances and
the divisions within himself. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Crusoe</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Island</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1965</TIMEX>), he is both
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robinson Crusoe</ENAMEX> and "<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX>'s progeny,/ The brood of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crusoe</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">slave</ENAMEX>." His more
recent poetry, especially the epic <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Omeros</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX>, wavers between an
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">exile</ENAMEX>'s nostalgia and a cosmopolitan's at-homeness in the world.

            
The title of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Bounty</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walcott</ENAMEX>'s first
book of poems since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Omeros</ENAMEX> , is a tangle of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walcott</ENAMEX> is,
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of all, acknowledging <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">his 1992</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Nobel Prize</ENAMEX> in literature, which (quoting
the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Irish Nobel Laureate W.B. Yeats</ENAMEX>) he calls " 'the bounty of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sweden</ENAMEX>.' " The
prize paid for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walcott</ENAMEX>'s retreat on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">St.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lucia</ENAMEX>: "this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX> facing white combers
that stands/ for hot, rutted lanes far from the disease of power." <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walcott</ENAMEX> is playing off the celluloid The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bounty of Fletcher Christian</ENAMEX>
and the "white <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">God ... Captain Bligh</ENAMEX>," which rhymes in his mind with the ebb
and flow of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX> tyranny and freedom: "The ribbed body with its cargo/
stalls in its doldrums, the God-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">captain</ENAMEX> is cast adrift/ by a mutinous
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX>." Finally--a major theme of this slim book--there is the recurring
light of each <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Antillean day: "Bounty</ENAMEX>!<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">/</ENAMEX> In the bells of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">frogs</ENAMEX> with their
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">steady clamour/</ENAMEX> in the indigo dark before dawn, the fading <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">morse</ENAMEX>/ of fireflies
and crickets, then light on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">beetle</ENAMEX>'s armour."

            Despite
its upbeat title, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Bounty</ENAMEX> is a book of elegies, a response to the
"many deaths, nothing short of a massacre"--including the deaths of his mother
and his close <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Brodsky</ENAMEX>--that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walcott</ENAMEX> has endured during
his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seventh decade</TIMEX>. As he improvises on themes from the Western elegiac
tradition, in which spring consoles for the losses of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walcott</ENAMEX> finds
that certain notes don't sound in the tropics, where there is "no climate, no
calendar except for this bountiful day." And he is surprised, as elegists
always are, "that earth <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">rejoices</ENAMEX>/ in the middle of our agony."

            If <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Omeros</ENAMEX> , like its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Homeric</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>, was a poem about
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fathers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Bounty</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walcott</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> book, an attempt "to draw the
veiled figure/ of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Mamma</ENAMEX> entering the standard elegiac." The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX>-part title
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">poem</ENAMEX> is both an elegy for her and a poem about her island, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walcott</ENAMEX>'s
"<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>-country." Its opening lines attempt to pry the beauty of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Antilles</ENAMEX>
loose from advertising brochures, that false paradise in which, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walcott</ENAMEX>
wrote in his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nobel</ENAMEX> lecture, "the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX> is a blue pool into which the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">republic</ENAMEX> dangles the extended foot of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX>":

            Between the vision of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tourist Board</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">trueParadise</ENAMEX> lies the desert where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Isaiah</ENAMEX>'s
elationsforce a rose from the sand. The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">third</NUMEX> canto

            cores the dawn clouds
with concentric radiance,the breadfruit opens its palms in praise of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bounty</ENAMEX>, bois-pain , <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bread</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">slave</ENAMEX> food, the bliss of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">John</ENAMEX>
Clare,

            torn, wandering <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom</ENAMEX>,
stoat-stroker in his <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">county</ENAMEX> ...

            In
those <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> lines, freighted with the layered voice of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> culture,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dante</ENAMEX>'s vision of paradise is invoked both explicitly, in the "concentric
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">radiance</ENAMEX>" of the last canto of his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paradiso</ENAMEX> , and implicitly, in his
braided <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">terza rima</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-line stanzas, rhyming--loosely here--aba, bcb, etc.).
That paradise is linked, in turn, with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Isaiah</ENAMEX>'s prophecy of the imminent
appearance of God in the desert, a promise confirmed, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> view, by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus</ENAMEX>' birth.

            
But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walcott</ENAMEX> also wants an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">outsider</ENAMEX>'s view on
this exalted material, and he finds it in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19 th -century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peasant-poet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Clare</ENAMEX>, whom he makes into a stand-in for himself. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Walcott</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">twins Clare</ENAMEX>--who was driven mad by social injustice and consoled by the
smallest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">beings</ENAMEX> in nature--with mad <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edgar</ENAMEX>'s disguise in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">King Lear</ENAMEX> ,
who, like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clare</ENAMEX>, wanders the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> countryside praising <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">frogs</ENAMEX> and gnats: "I
am moved like you, mad <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom</ENAMEX>, by a line of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ants</ENAMEX>;/ I behold their industry and
they are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">giants</ENAMEX>." This couplet sends us back to an already famous passage in
Omeros , in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> loading <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coal</ENAMEX> are compared to a line of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ants</ENAMEX>--and
so on.

            In the
rest of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Bounty</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walcott</ENAMEX> relinquishes such allusive density for the
simple, history-erasing realities of life in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Antilles</ENAMEX> islands: the mango
<ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> that "serenely rust when they are in flower," the firefly that "keeps
striking matches." This culture-nature split corresponds, in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walcott</ENAMEX>'s personal
mythology, with a split in himself: his <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> education and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX>
childhood; his <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">St.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lucia</ENAMEX>; the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> races, white and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">black</ENAMEX>, of his ancestry; and "the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> languages I know--one so rich/ in its
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">imperial</ENAMEX> intimacies, its echo of privilege,/ the other like the orange words of
a hillside in drought--/ but my love of both wide as the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX> is
large."

            
There's a risk of sentimentality in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walcott</ENAMEX>'s
praise of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX>. A little pun in his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nobel</ENAMEX> lecture appears to gloss
over, and even celebrate, the privations of underdevelopment: "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">In the Antilles</ENAMEX>
poverty is poetry with a 'v,' une vie , a condition of life as well as of
imagination." (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Easy</ENAMEX> for him to say, with that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nobel</ENAMEX>-bought <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">bungalow</ENAMEX>!) And
again: "Visual surprise is natural in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX>; it comes with the
landscape, and faced with its beauty, the sigh of History dissolves." Well,
maybe the sigh , but not the fact of history, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walcott</ENAMEX> knows quite
well.

            Such
remarks, in any case, are part of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walcott</ENAMEX>'s own emerging self-definition as a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX> he has increasingly aligned himself not with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> or
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> poetry but with a multilingual and multiracial <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Antillean</ENAMEX> literature
that includes such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jean Rhys</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lafcadio Hearn, Saint</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Perse</ENAMEX>
(another <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Nobel</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">winner</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">V.S. Naipaul</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C.L.R. James</ENAMEX>. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX>, in
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walcott</ENAMEX>'s view, have managed to see the islands as they are--in all their
"visual surprise"--and not as some fragment or falling-off from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European</ENAMEX>
achievements. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walcott</ENAMEX>'s faith, as expressed in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Bounty</ENAMEX> , is finally a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">painter</ENAMEX>'s faith, that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poet</ENAMEX>'s job is "to write of the light's bounty on
familiar things."

            
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walcott</ENAMEX> trained to be a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painter</ENAMEX>--like his
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">schoolteacher father</ENAMEX>, who died when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walcott</ENAMEX> was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX>--and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Bounty</ENAMEX>
is his most painterly book, in method and theme. If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Bounty</ENAMEX> is low on
autobiographical detail, or the dailiness of this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poet</ENAMEX>'s life and travels, it
is rich in acts of looking. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walcott</ENAMEX>'s keen eye is drawn repeatedly to the
complementary blues and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oranges</ENAMEX> of his native landscape: "there, against the
indigo-blue <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Cruz</ENAMEX>/ <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">mountains</ENAMEX>, the immortelle ignites its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branches</ENAMEX> with
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">orange/ blossoms</ENAMEX>, however briefly, while the incredible blue is/ as indifferent
as ever."

            
               The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bounty</ENAMEX> is studded
with the names of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painters</ENAMEX>, especially those with a link to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Willows</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> bud "like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowds</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pissarro</ENAMEX> along a wet <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">boulevard</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">branches</ENAMEX>." "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manet</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Martinique</ENAMEX>" evokes ghosts of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> culture inhabiting the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">island</ENAMEX>. Pissarro, though <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walcott</ENAMEX> doesn't mention it, was a native of the small
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">St.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas</ENAMEX>, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virgin Islands</ENAMEX>, while the 17-year-old
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manet</ENAMEX> traveled the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX> as a sailor in training. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the strongest
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">poems</ENAMEX> in the book, the that begins "I cannot remember the name of that seacoast
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>," evokes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monet</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walcott</ENAMEX> reconstitutes, with the help of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of his own
watercolors, a dimly remembered stippled seascape in northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wistful</ENAMEX>, wry, at times
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">valedictory</ENAMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">poem</ENAMEX> playfully offers the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poet</ENAMEX>'s own epitaph), The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bounty</ENAMEX> is one of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walcott</ENAMEX>'s most inviting volumes, incorporating some of his
best work since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Star-Apple Kingdom</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1979</TIMEX>. In his pleasure in the
sheer variousness of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">paradises</ENAMEX> found and lost, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walcott</ENAMEX> glories in what the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poet</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gerard Manley Hopkins</ENAMEX> called "dappled things."
