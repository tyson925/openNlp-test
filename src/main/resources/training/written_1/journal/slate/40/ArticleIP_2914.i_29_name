            Although we think of
photomontage primarily as a medium of the combative period of modernism--Dada,
Surrealism, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Constructivism</ENAMEX>--its use goes back well into the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">th</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">century</ENAMEX>, and was routine in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">turn-of-the-century</TIMEX> pop culture in postcards and
prints. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hannah Höch</ENAMEX> said she discovered its possibilities when she saw a kitsch
tableau of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> military glory; the idealized <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldier</ENAMEX> had her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">landlord</ENAMEX>'s face
pasted on. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Höch</ENAMEX> and her then <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lover</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Raoul Hausmann</ENAMEX> formed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> branch of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX> Dada <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, which came to appear the more aesthetic <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>, as
distinguished from the more political <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX> represented by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Heartfield</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Grosz</ENAMEX>. All of them began to make montages around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1918</TIMEX>, and for a few
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> made works that are at least superficially very similar: explosions of
newspaper photographs and lines of type across a white <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">field</ENAMEX>. They were angry
and wanted to break something--the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX>, the industries--but had to
restrict themselves to the materials of the print media that served and
reflected those <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Höch</ENAMEX> has
long been best known for one of her first works, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Cut with a Kitchen Knife</ENAMEX>
Dada through the last <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Weimar Beer-Belly Cultural Epoch</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1919-20</TIMEX>.
You can see all the anger and exhilaration of the period in this large piece
(<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">nearly 3 feet by 4</NUMEX>), full of wheels and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowds</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heads</ENAMEX> whose eyes have been
replaced by other things, its yellowed newsprint color jazzed by a patch of
blue in the upper left, its improvisatorial speed of execution shown by how the
glued surfaces have rippled. Its drift is apparent right away: Dada versus the
anti-Dada of all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generals</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">exploiters</ENAMEX>. Looking more closely, however,
you notice a subtler feminist subtheme. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Greta Garbo, Käthe Kollwitz</ENAMEX>, and other
emancipated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> are significantly portrayed, and at the lower right is a map
of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> in which the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> that have given <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> the right to vote appear
in white. It is on the edge of this map that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Höch</ENAMEX> has stuck a tiny portrait of
herself.

            Most surveys of photomontage reproduce this work and
perhaps <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one or two</NUMEX> others by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Höch</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1920s</TIMEX>, but she continued
working in the medium into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1970s</TIMEX> (she died in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1978</TIMEX>), continually expanding
her style and enlarging the terrain of the medium. As <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hausmann</ENAMEX>'s work grew more
formal and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Heartfield</ENAMEX> became the most effective agitprop <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, Höch
became more playful. At the same time that she was engaging in her blistering
Dada stuff, for example, she was making delicate work based on embroidery
patterns that is both unashamedly feminine and the perfect riposte to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">masculine</ENAMEX> machine-fixation of the time, which in fact it resembles in its
dynamism. It is also more purely abstract than anything anyone else was doing.
What is striking about the ensemble of her works on display (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 100</NUMEX>
pieces) is her freedom. Others from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heartfield</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Max Ernst</ENAMEX> built their
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">montages</ENAMEX> and collages on a classic stagelike ground, with centralized figures,
a place for them to stand, and a backdrop behind them. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Höch</ENAMEX> pointedly or
cavalierly toyed with this concept and eventually dispensed with it altogether.
While others parodied, she invented. She flung scale, gravity, continuity, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">illusionism</ENAMEX> around at will. Even her most labor-intensive works manage to look
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">spontaneous</ENAMEX> and somehow carefree.

            She cuts
up faces and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> and fits together parts mismatched in size, color, and
style, like a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frankenstein</ENAMEX> bent on demonstrating through surgery the folly
of beauty culture. In her "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ethnographic Museum</ENAMEX>" series she arranges mergers of
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asian</ENAMEX> sculpture and Western body parts, asking: "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Who's the</ENAMEX>
primitive now?" Her politics are always present but always lowercase, even her
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">angriest</ENAMEX> works apparently suffused with insouciant fun. So you might get the
idea that her views on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Nazis</ENAMEX> were muted--she did remain in an obscure
semirural corner of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX> through the war, after all. But while her work
wouldn't be anybody's idea of propaganda, it is nevertheless acute. Her <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Nazi</ENAMEX>,
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Little P</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1931</TIMEX>), has slick hair and a prowlike nose over the open
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mouth</ENAMEX> of an infant--the bawling, spittle-webbed orifice is convincingly that of
a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX>-rally orator. Her <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Girl</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1930</TIMEX>), meanwhile, has bangs
instead of brains, and a cute little topknot like a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pinhead</ENAMEX>'s.

            
In the darkest years of the war, though, Höch
was plunging into a world of pure form and color. As the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX> pass it
becomes harder and harder to figure out what a given shape or texture in her
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">montages</ENAMEX> might originally have represented. During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1940s</TIMEX> she shed the last
bits of hard-edged Weimar sensibility and enacted a version of Surrealism
entirely her own, dense with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ernst</ENAMEX>-like <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bugs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> and creepy Matta-ish
plant forms. But <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the following decade</TIMEX>, even this gave way to works of pure
nonrepresentational electricity, so bursting and swooping they make you want to
use words like "painterly" and "gestural"--oxymoronically, they seem to be a
kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Abstract Expressionism</ENAMEX> built from little, carefully scissored <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">bits</NUMEX> of
magazine photographs. They can sometimes appear unfocused in their intensity,
like too many sounds turning into white noise. But then she could still turn
out beautifully restrained work such as the significantly titled <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">1955 Glue</ENAMEX>
Drawing , a single 1920s "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">New Vision</ENAMEX>" photograph of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pools</ENAMEX>, taken apart
and reassembled with dramatic spaces. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">source</ENAMEX> is completely present and made
greater; the violence done to it is in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">service</ENAMEX> of its original intent: an
ode to the ellipse.

            Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> have said that
this is a big show for a "minor" <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX>. It is true that if you were editing
the show to make a point you could omit <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as much as two-thirds</NUMEX> of it. It is also
true that montage is often considered a minor form, lacking the heroism of
painting and sculpture and even photography. After all, what is it but
recycling? But the show's size is one of its greatest assets--it is seldom that
an exhibition so thoroughly documents the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX>'s changes and leaps over the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX>, like a time-lapse film. It is also striking how contemporary to us
much of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Höch</ENAMEX>'s work feels, in its sexual politics, its humor, its gleeful
appropriation of anything and everything at hand--indeed, in its refusal of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">grandeur</ENAMEX>. Photomontage thumbs its nose at the pretension of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX> playing
God, the blank canvas his world. It is the art of making do, of fashioning
something personal from the incessant bombardment of images to which we are
subjected. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Höch</ENAMEX> in her modest way told the spectacle where to get off, and set
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about</NUMEX> reconfiguring it with her scissors.
