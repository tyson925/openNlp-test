            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guggenheim Museum</ENAMEX>, which
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX> has earned a reputation for expansionist sprawl, has mounted a
surprisingly intimate exhibition in its <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX>. The show has a
sprawling title, "China: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Years--Innovation and Transformation in the</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arts</ENAMEX>," and the temptation must have been great to fill every corner of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>
with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> things, as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> did with its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Robert Rauschenberg</ENAMEX> show last
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> show has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> venues, but one is really a footnote to the other.
The "traditional" section--what most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> mean by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> art, and by far the
most rewarding of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> parts--is housed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Lloyd Wright</ENAMEX>'s uptown
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">snail</ENAMEX>, while post-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1850</NUMEX> paintings and prints are crammed into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SoHo</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">branch</ENAMEX>.

            One
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">curator</ENAMEX>'s taste and concept shaped the "traditional" exhibition. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sherman Lee</ENAMEX>,
longtime <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cleveland Museum of Art</ENAMEX> and the foremost <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholar</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> art, selected the treasures on view from collections in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>. Many of these objects, including those culled from recent archaeological
finds, have never been shown in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> before. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lee</ENAMEX> tried to choose
objects that demonstrated innovation and experimentation; he has a particular
interest in the relationship between technological advances--in ceramic and
bronze production, for example--and creative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ferment</ENAMEX>.

            The result is a surprisingly old-fashioned exhibition, low
on social and historical context and high in the pleasures of simply looking.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> feels that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wright</ENAMEX>, who was passionate about <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asian</ENAMEX> art, would have enjoyed a
slow walk up his spiraling ramp, stopping here and there to admire the stunning
objects in generously spaced glass cases. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX> are grouped according to
material--jade, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bronze</ENAMEX>, low- and high-fired ceramic, lacquer, stone
sculpture--rather than period. This means that improvements in glaze quality
and metallurgy become clear, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewer</ENAMEX> must grope for what links an
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">austere</ENAMEX>, octagonal <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Tang</ENAMEX> vase to a theatrically rearing, gilded bronze dragon
from the same era.

            In the
absence of an overarching narrative of dynastic progression or decline, one's
attention shifts to small marvels. Several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX> in the show reflect a dry
sense of humor. The ancient bronzes are covered with metamorphosing animal
shapes--an <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">elephant</ENAMEX> whose trunk has turned into a dragon, and whose legs are
incised with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">tigers</ENAMEX> ("stucco'd with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">quadrupeds</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> all over," as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whitman</ENAMEX>
wrote of himself). Then there's a little toy <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cart</ENAMEX> with moving wheels supporting
a treasure chest with swinging doors. A <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-legged <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">guardian</ENAMEX> holds the door in
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> hand, a crutch in the other. Why one leg? So he can't run away with the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">treasure</ENAMEX>. This ingenious toy dates, incredibly, from circa <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1100-771</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">B.C.</ENAMEX>

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guggenheim</ENAMEX> show is particularly rich in
three-dimensional objects. One turn of the ramp and you can get a pretty good
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">education</ENAMEX> in the origins of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">porcelain</ENAMEX>. The perfection of that translucent and
acoustically resonant pottery, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a thousand years</TIMEX> before the West discovered its
secret recipe, gave the name "china" to fine dinnerware in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. As you reach
the top of the show, you come across a parade of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty</TIMEX> or so placid Buddhas
meditating under <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wright</ENAMEX>'s sky-lit <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dome</ENAMEX>. Is it an illusion that they seem to be
putting on weight? It is not: "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">In the latter Tang dynasty</ENAMEX>," says the wall
panel, "<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX> images tended to become more ponderous, fleshy, and overly
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ornate</ENAMEX>, completely departing from the slender and ethereal beauty
characteristic of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many sixth-century</TIMEX> sculptures."

            The
paintings are hidden down discreetly marked passageways in darkened <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">galleries</ENAMEX>.
The well-known <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholar</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Cahill</ENAMEX>, who wrote the essay on painting for the
exhibition catalog, tells of taking a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">connoisseur</ENAMEX> through the European
painting collection of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Gallery</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>. "Very nice,"
commented the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitor</ENAMEX>, "but they all look alike." <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cahill</ENAMEX> is at pains to show
the differences among <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> landscape paintings, which, to an untrained
Western <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">eye</ENAMEX>, can blur together. He notes that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painters</ENAMEX> mastered
verisimilitude early on--by the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10 th</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">11 th</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">century</TIMEX>--and
spent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next few centuries</TIMEX> developing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Expressionist</ENAMEX> departures from it. In
the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West</ENAMEX>, a comparable moment occurs with the advent of modernism early in this
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">century</ENAMEX>.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> masterpieces hanging side by side show how two
different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painters</ENAMEX> responded to similar social pressures. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wang Meng</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ni</ENAMEX> Zan
worked during the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yuan</ENAMEX> period (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1279-1368</TIMEX>), when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mongol</ENAMEX> invaders had seized
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> of southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wang</ENAMEX> served the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mongol</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rulers</ENAMEX> just as he had the
earlier <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ni</ENAMEX> chose exile instead, adopting a nomadic life--he traveled
around in a little boat--and painting to pay his keep.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wang</ENAMEX>'s
famous painting of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Dwelling</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Qingbian Mountains</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1366</TIMEX>)
explodes the myth of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX>'s peaceful retreat in the hills. These hills
have a cascading fury to them, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dwelling</ENAMEX> seems to be under siege.
Indeed, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">factions</ENAMEX> striving to succeed the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mongol</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rulers</ENAMEX> were warring nearby
when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wang</ENAMEX> painted this commotion in the natural realm. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ni</ENAMEX>, by contrast, paints
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> gaunt <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> by the riverside and calls the picture <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Six Gentlemen</ENAMEX>
(<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1345</TIMEX>). It is a potent image of alienation and disengagement, a stark visual
rebuff to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wang</ENAMEX>'s life of chameleonic compromise. An <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">art</ENAMEX> whose expressive
conventions can survive <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a century</TIMEX> of alien <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">occupation</ENAMEX> must be as flexible and
deeply rooted as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ni</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">disheveled trees</ENAMEX>.

            If the din of history is held at bay in the uptown section
of "China: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,000</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Years</TIMEX>," it is everywhere audible downtown, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SoHo</ENAMEX>
installation of post-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1850</NUMEX> work. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ren Xiong</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shanghai</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX> who died of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tuberculosis</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1857</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 34</TIMEX>, tries to balance <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> tradition with the
inroads of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Western</ENAMEX> art in his unsettling self-portrait. His bare <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> and long
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fingernails</ENAMEX> slip out, diva-like, from jaggedly stylized clothes. His intent
face is rendered according to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> naturalistic conventions. It's as though
he is shedding his <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">accoutrements</ENAMEX>, and warily embracing a Westernized
future.

            The embrace was brief and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">traumatic</ENAMEX>. The woodcut revival of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">1920s</NUMEX> occurred just in time to record the
horrors of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> invasion; stark images of torture recall <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goya</ENAMEX>'s
Disasters of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">War</ENAMEX> , which detailed <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> suffering under <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Napoleonic</ENAMEX>
rule. Upstairs are a couple of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Socialist Realism</ENAMEX>, with ubiquitous
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maos</ENAMEX>--<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, youthfully slender in front of a traditionally rendered mountain,
then putting on weight just like those <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buddhas</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Five thousand years</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chinese</ENAMEX>
art, and you end up staring at a painting of a cluster of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peasants grinning</ENAMEX> in
front of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Tiananmen Palace</ENAMEX>, below the visage of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mao</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">The year</TIMEX> is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1964</TIMEX> and all
seems well, notwithstanding the recent <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Great Famine</ENAMEX>, perhaps the most severe in
human history and almost entirely <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mao</ENAMEX>'s fault. Everything in these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> is
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">superficial</ENAMEX> and forced--a depressing departure from the confident traditions of
wit and invention that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> had nourished in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the previous 50 centuries</TIMEX>, and is
nourishing even now, albeit by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">marginalized artists</ENAMEX> who were given no place in
this show. The very existence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Guggenheim</ENAMEX> exhibition signals yet another
experiment in opening <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> to the West. But it's hard not to see in these
smiling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peasants</ENAMEX> a warning of what such openings can bring in their wake.
