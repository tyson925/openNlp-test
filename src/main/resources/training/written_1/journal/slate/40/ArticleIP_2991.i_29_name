            She's back. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Naomi Wolf</ENAMEX>, for
better or worse <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this decade</TIMEX>'s representative feminist voice, has written a
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> book arguing that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> should ... well, after all this time, it's still
not clear what we're supposed to do. In <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Beauty Myth</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolf</ENAMEX> argued
that cosmetics <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>, plastic surgeons, and the appearance-obsessed media
were cheating <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> out of feminist gains. In <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Fire With Fire</ENAMEX> , she argued
that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> were cheating themselves by blaming all their problems on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>. But
her suggestions for fixing these crises have never gone very deep. Her point,
that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> should stop letting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> set the agenda and start attending to our
own desires, sounds reasonable, even obvious. But it's also vague. And it
doesn't help that her prose races along like a press release from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Utopia</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolf</ENAMEX>'s
new book, like her pet theme of "desire," is extremely hard to pin down and,
once in a while, even embarrassing. It's a high-concept package, a blend of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">memoir</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolf</ENAMEX> recalls learning about sex as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> growing up in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francisco</ENAMEX>'s racy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hippie</ENAMEX> district, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Haight-Ashbury</ENAMEX>) and reporting (she gets
childhood <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> to cough up their key <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">moments</TIMEX>). There are also some scattered
minihistories of female desire among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taoists</ENAMEX> and among the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zunis</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX>,
which are provocative (a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">th -century Zuni</ENAMEX> ceremony celebrating the
superiority of the vulva required <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> to don huge wooden penises) but feel as
if they were cribbed in a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">45-minute</TIMEX> visit to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX>. And she sprinkles in
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half a dozen</NUMEX> policy ideas. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolf</ENAMEX> seems to think that everyone would get along
better if we all went away on retreat.

            So why is this book interesting? It does contain some
elegantly rendered anecdotes, and several small but shrewd insights. But,
mostly, it's a window on a problem in current feminism. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolf</ENAMEX>'s fixation on
desire isn't so much an idea as a good intention, an attempt to make feminism
feel less like a complaint--to give <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> equal rights not just to a job but to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ecstasy</ENAMEX>. But desire is a tricky, multifaceted thing. It can refer to a purely
physical arousal, or to a heartfelt experience of love. It can also refer to a
more idle, juvenile form of daydreaming--to the heated but generic longing a
pop star evokes, for instance, when he wails, "I want you."

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolf</ENAMEX> mixes
up all these types of desire but, too often, her recollections fall under the
heady <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX> of idle, juvenile <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Desire No. 3</ENAMEX>. She lovingly recalls sleepover
parties where she and her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> inspected each other's budding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chests</ENAMEX>, and
dances where she rubbed up against a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX>'s crotch. Her own education appears to
have been gradual, even Pollyanna-ishly prudent: She and her sweet, square
boyfriend dutifully visited the birth-control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinic</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three weeks</TIMEX> before the
non-earthshaking surrender of her virginity. The sky isn't always sunny: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolf</ENAMEX>
gets groped by a menacing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stranger</ENAMEX>, and a jealous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boyfriend</ENAMEX> hits her. Otherwise
there's little that hasn't already been covered by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judy Blume</ENAMEX>.

            For someone writing on desire, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolf</ENAMEX>, curiously, has a good
deal of trouble describing the actual experience of letting loose. In the
passage that follows, she recalls <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX> she was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>, living on a kibbutz,
dying to sneak off and make out with a forbidden <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Irish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Devin</ENAMEX>. It's a
good example of her smooth, graceful prose--and also of her shocking tendency
to break life down into abstract terms:

            If to my trip <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counselors</ENAMEX> I
was a miscegenating <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rebel</ENAMEX>, and if to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ofra</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">uncle</ENAMEX>, whose censure I still
remembered, I was a godforsaken secular <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jew</ENAMEX>, and if to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Devin</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mates</ENAMEX> I was that
locker-room joke, the lubricious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JAP</ENAMEX>, and if in the eyes of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX> men
observing us while they played sheshhesh in the market <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cafes</ENAMEX> I was a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> of dissolute <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> who are beyond
whoredom, then the weight of these clashing systems of control and expectation
around female sexuality was just too much. In my mind, under the burden of all
those dictates competing to stereotype rather than support me, the legitimacy
of the notion of such control simply collapsed.

            To cut to
the chase--she kissed him. But this stuff about "clashing systems of control"
doesn't sound like the thoughts of a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13-year-old</TIMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> begins to feel
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tricked</ENAMEX>. One minute <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolf</ENAMEX> is supposed to be revealing her most intimate
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">experiences</ENAMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the next minute</TIMEX> she's writing in a humorless, self-regarding
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">academese</ENAMEX>. There's a kind of intellectual greed going on here, almost a sense
of entitlement. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolf</ENAMEX> seems to think that because her goal is worthy,
methodologically speaking, anything goes.

            It's important to be clear. I'm not arguing that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolf</ENAMEX> is
incoherent because her approach is feminine and therefore soft and gooey. In
fact, if she would just pick an approach, any approach, it would be a relief.
Nor am I arguing that she exaggerates the problems girls face as they grow up.
As a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolf</ENAMEX> usually hits the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX>, or at least gets near it.

            She's
right, for example, that sex education now is a bad compromise between
puritanical shame and a cold, clinical detachment. Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> get some sort of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">instruction</ENAMEX>, but dangerous concepts like pleasure and love are scrupulously
avoided; we're taught to think of ourselves as scary coils of tubing that are
hard to keep clean, and which periodically leak. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolf</ENAMEX> the complaining
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">propagandist</ENAMEX> is flaky, but not unsound.

            
It's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolf</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">thinker</ENAMEX> who's wobbly. She erases
distinctions--besides <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">apples</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oranges</ENAMEX>, she's mixing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peaches</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pickles</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prunes</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of her more comical tics is to repeat a concept over and over,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">uncritically</ENAMEX>, until it takes on an almost physical presence, like a parody of a
Platonic ideal. In <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Beauty Myth</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolf</ENAMEX> grouped all our expectations
and prejudices surrounding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>'s chest-size under a single heading: "The
Official Breast." I couldn't help imagining a life-size dancing mascot. In
Promiscuities , the mantra is "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Slut</ENAMEX>." This is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolf</ENAMEX>'s term for that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">eighth</NUMEX> grade who sprouted breasts early, fooled around with too
many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX>, and got slammed with a bad reputation. According to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolf</ENAMEX> she
embodies the nascent sexuality that pubescent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> are trained to fear and
loathe, so we turn her into a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scapegoat</ENAMEX>. It's a reasonable if not original
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">observation</ENAMEX>, based on a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolf</ENAMEX>'s who got pregnant and eventually
dropped out of school. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolf</ENAMEX> builds it up into a timeless international
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">archetype</ENAMEX>. Soon she's writing "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A Short History of the Slut</ENAMEX>." (It's short
indeed, going from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mesopotamia</ENAMEX> to medieval <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Burgundy</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nicole Simpson</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>
pages.) And in the next chapter we're asked to take it as an established fact
that all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, everywhere, since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the beginning of time</TIMEX>, have lived in fear of
entering "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Slut's Dominion</ENAMEX>." What's worse, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolf</ENAMEX> flip-flops in her opinion of
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Slut</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every few</TIMEX> pages. On the one hand, she's the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pitiful victim</ENAMEX> of our
hypocrisy and our unnecessary shame. On the other hand, we're also supposed to
envy her, because she violates the restraints we've imposed on ourselves.

            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end</TIMEX>, what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolf</ENAMEX> really
seems to be saying is that sex is perfectly wholesome--it's our uptightness and
moralizing that are corrupt. She's right, of course. And yet, after a while,
all this going on about how <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> are not allowed to feel desire begins to feel
like a kind of nostalgic fantasy. "As adult <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, those of us who are
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heterosexual</ENAMEX> sometimes have a sense of a lost <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eden</ENAMEX>," she writes at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> point.
And later, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">à la Rousseau</ENAMEX>, "As my understanding of the kinds of scripts about
sexuality available to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> bore down on me, the forest would function the way
that fantasies of wilderness functioned for the urbanized eighteenth<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-century</TIMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> mind: I would find myself making a mental reference to the forest when
I searched for a symbol for female <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">lust</ENAMEX>." This isn't much more than pining--a
longing for longing. I suppose it's only fair that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> win equal rights to
good old, solipsistic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Desire No. 3</ENAMEX>. But the victory feels pretty hollow.
