            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Steiner</ENAMEX> has been
writing his incandescent essays on high culture for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nearly four decades</TIMEX> now,
steadily deepening his insights and widening his topical reach, but carrying on
the same essential errand. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> times, he would have been one of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Enlightenment</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">missionaries</ENAMEX>; in our own, he has come to be seen more as a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">guardian</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defender</ENAMEX> of embattled humanism. While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Steiner</ENAMEX> has hewed to
traditions and verities, the world around him has been mutating.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post-structuralism</ENAMEX> has come and gone; multiculturalism is exercising its
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">liberations</ENAMEX> and tyrannies; the computer has become the dominant tool of
discourse. And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Steiner</ENAMEX> has been quietly gathering the authority of his
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">intransigence</ENAMEX>.

            
               No <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Passion Spent</ENAMEX> ,
the latest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critic</ENAMEX>'s many studies and collections, sends its root threads
back to nearly every phase of his complex endeavor. There are essays on all the
familiar Steiner <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>--translation, tragedy, the eclipse of humane culture,
the connection between language and ethics, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Judaism</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Holocaust</ENAMEX>. New,
if not unexpected, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kierkegaard</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simone Weil</ENAMEX>, dreams, the
deaths of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Socrates</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus</ENAMEX>, and the phenomenology of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edmund Husserl</ENAMEX>.

            Steiner
opens the collection with "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Uncommon Reader</ENAMEX>," a tour-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">de</ENAMEX>-force meditation on
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jean-Sim√©on Chardin</ENAMEX>'s painting <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Le Philosophe</ENAMEX> lisant , which becomes,
through attentive reading of details--"his folio, his hourglass, his incised
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">medallions</ENAMEX>, his ready quill"--an emblem for the vanishing culture of book and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reader</ENAMEX>. Reading has always been, for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Steiner</ENAMEX>, a quasi-priestly activity. As he
writes in "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Real Presences</ENAMEX>," the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> essay: "Where we read truly, where the
experience is to be that of meaning, we do so as if the text ...
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">incarnates</ENAMEX> ... a real presence of significant being ." <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chardin</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reader</ENAMEX>, in his solitary bearing, his grave demeanor, honors this most freighted
obligation, which can be construed as an obligation to being itself. But "the
revolution ... brought on by computers, by planetary electronic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchanges</ENAMEX>, by
'cyber-space' and (soon) 'virtual reality,' " as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steiner</ENAMEX> puts it in his
introduction, has all but brought this particular sense of presence to
extinction. He lets himself dream that there might arise "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> of creative
reading," but he also knows that his dreams will remain just that.

            For all his elegiac rumination, though, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Steiner</ENAMEX> does not
lack a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">polemicist</ENAMEX>'s instinct for the intellectual or ideological "hot spot." He
begins his attack with smaller provocations: In "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A Reading Against</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare</ENAMEX>," for instance, he uses <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wittgenstein</ENAMEX>'s stated reservations about
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bard</ENAMEX> to test some of our dearest assumptions about this mythic figure.
Without ever calling <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare</ENAMEX>'s linguistic greatness into question, Steiner
suggests an alternative requirement for true greatness, that comprehended in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> term <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dichter</ENAMEX> , which carries certain lofty notions of witness
and moral responsibility. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steiner</ENAMEX> knows his <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare</ENAMEX> is no
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dichter</ENAMEX> . The work is too teeming, too multiform; it lacks the felt force
of either the presence or absence of God. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare</ENAMEX> gives us plenitude at the
expense of ethics or higher spiritual aspiration. The conclusion, cagey,
teasing, is one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Steiner</ENAMEX>'s typically pregnant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">equivocations</ENAMEX>. Plato, he
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">proclaims</ENAMEX>, "was wrong when he banished the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">poets</ENAMEX>. Wittgentstein misreads
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare</ENAMEX>. Surely this must be so.

            And yet."

            The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">essay</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">"Archives of Eden</ENAMEX>" seeks to provoke on a larger scale. Advancing
example after example, measuring reputations--those of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">composers</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger Sessions</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elliott Carter</ENAMEX>, say, against those of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stravinsky</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schoenberg</ENAMEX>--Steiner
insists that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> has produced very little that can stand up to the
intellectual or artistic achievements of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. The "dominant apparatus of
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> high culture," he writes, "is that of custody"; they make the
art, we build the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX>. If there is truth to the contention--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steiner</ENAMEX> is
persuasive when he compares various fields and finds that only architecture and
modern dance, those uniquely <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">triumphs</ENAMEX>, exhibit signs of life--his
argument still feels more like animadversion than rigorous reflection.

            If, as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Steiner</ENAMEX> claims, the greatness of a culture rests
upon traditions, upon history, then <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> must be found wanting. In a
dangerously cantilevered sentence of the kind that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Steiner</ENAMEX> does at times resort
to, he asserts: "[<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">I</ENAMEX>]t may well be that the ethnic-demographic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> in the
successive waves of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">settlement</ENAMEX> are 'Darwinian negative,' that they
embody the brilliant survival of an anti-historical <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, where
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'anti-historianism</ENAMEX>' would entail an abdication from those adaptive mechanisms
of tragic intellectuality, of ideological 'caring' (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kierkegaard's</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heidegger</ENAMEX>'s
word <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sorge</ENAMEX> ) which are indispensable to cultural creation of the first
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rank</ENAMEX>." For the rest of us, a translation: What those tired and huddled masses
that wash up on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>'s shores are tired of, specifically, is history.

            The
argument continues. Steiner rears up to make his well-known linkage between
elite culture and eruptions of barbarism. He notes that "the correlations
between extreme creativity ... and political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">justice</ENAMEX> are, to a significant
degree at least, negative." In this regard, he argues, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> choice for
a leveling democracy "makes abundant sense."

            He ends by questioning whether the threat to thought and
creation of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> rank lies in the "apparatus of political repression" or
in "a consensus of spiritual-social values in which the television showing of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'Holocaust'</ENAMEX> is interrupted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every fourteen</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> by commercials, in which
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX>-oven sequences are interspersed and financed by ads for pantihose and
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">deodorants?</ENAMEX>" His own answer, maddeningly brief, invokes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Archimedes</ENAMEX>' garden in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syracuse</ENAMEX>, where the philosopher worked defiantly on his theorem even as
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">barbarians</ENAMEX> clamored at the gates. "That garden may have been a 'counter-<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eden</ENAMEX>,'
" writes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Steiner</ENAMEX>. "But it happens to be the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> in which you and I must
continue our labor. My hunch is that it lies in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Syracuse</ENAMEX> still--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sicily</ENAMEX>, that
is, rather than <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York State</ENAMEX>."

            This is all pure <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Steiner</ENAMEX>:
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">high-toned</ENAMEX> and irritating, vibrating with barely curtailed snobbism, but also
venturing hard queries and unpopular responses. His views are calculatedly
divisive. Indeed, it is hard to square one's indignation at being patronized
with the nettlesome suspicion that he may be right. Ours is not now, nor is it
ever likely to become, a "civilized" culture in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> sense of the word.
Most of us--God bless <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>--couldn't care less. This is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steiner</ENAMEX>'s point
precisely. We long ago decided to ignore the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poet</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counsel</ENAMEX> and took the road
more traveled. We narrowed our intellectual horizons and flattened our
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">discourse</ENAMEX>, and more than ever, we need a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critic</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steiner</ENAMEX> to remind us of
what a difference that choice has made. Those who feel no sense of crisis about
late-modern life will nibble and scowl and drop the book with an impatient
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">thump</ENAMEX>. The rest of us will be piqued, shamed, outraged, instructed, and maybe
perversely fortified.
