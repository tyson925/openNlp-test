            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Akhil Reed Amar</ENAMEX>, a professor
of law at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yale</ENAMEX>, is the acknowledged "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dean</ENAMEX>" of the so-called "truth <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>" of
criminal-justice reform. This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>, which is growing in influence among
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">academics</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judges</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">legislators</ENAMEX>, maintains that the object of criminal
trials must be the truth. To reach this goal, its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocates</ENAMEX> argue, the barriers
that stand in the way of convicting the truly guilty should be lowered. This
can be done by reinterpreting the relevant sections of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Constitution</ENAMEX> in
accordance with their original historical meaning. Among the barriers targeted
by the truth <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> are the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Fourth Amendment</ENAMEX>'s exclusionary rule--which forbids
the introduction into trial of evidence obtained in violation of that
amendment--and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Fifth Amendment</ENAMEX>'s prohibition on eliciting the truth from
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">criminal defendants</ENAMEX> by compelling them to testify.

            On an abstract level, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amar</ENAMEX>'s
argument is hard to disagree with. Who can be against the truth? The problem is
in the details. In this provocative and often brilliant book, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amar</ENAMEX> shows us
what his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Truth School</ENAMEX> would look like. It is a beautiful blueprint, but the
plans would not pass a safety inspection in the real world of cops, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">robbers</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecutors</ENAMEX>, defense <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judges</ENAMEX>.

            Amar
offers several radical recommendations. Besides his proposals to abolish
virtually all exclusionary rules and require criminal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defendants</ENAMEX> to testify
against themselves in pretrial depositions, he would limit search warrants to
the point of virtual disuse and, with them, the requirement of probable cause.
He would instead substitute a blanket rule decreeing that all searches that are
not "unreasonable"--an issue to be decided on an ad hoc basis by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">juries</ENAMEX>--satisfy the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Fourth Amendment</ENAMEX> standard.

            In fairness, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amar</ENAMEX> would attribute these views not to
himself but to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">framers</ENAMEX> of our <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Bill of Rights</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Historians</ENAMEX> differ, however,
as to the original meaning of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fourth and Fifth</ENAMEX> amendments. Not only can the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">devil</ENAMEX> cite scripture, but special pleaders can find in the open-textured words
and often ambiguous history of these hastily drafted amendments almost anything
they want to claim is the right (or left) approach. It is unlikely that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amar</ENAMEX>'s
prescription for a wholesale reinterpretation of established doctrine will soon
prevail. Nonetheless, his writings are too influential to be ignored, even if
the provocative issues he raises are more usefully (and honestly) argued on the
level of the policies they point to than on the level of what the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Constitution</ENAMEX>
dictates.

            What are
the policy implications of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amar</ENAMEX>'s proposals to change our current
interpretations of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fourth and Fifth</ENAMEX> amendments to bring them more in line
with the "search for truth"? These proposals should be evaluated on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX>:
Will they, in fact, produce more truth? And if so, will they undercut other
values more important than truth?

            
On the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> question, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amar</ENAMEX> tries to have it
both ways. He rightfully criticizes the current exclusionary rule for not
serving as an effective to police misconduct. His "better way" is to let
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> sue the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> for making mistakes in its quest for evidence. But
if this kind of tort remedy were to work effectively, it would, of necessity,
deter some searches that are <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> conducted by errant cops who do not fear the
occasional exclusion of illegally obtained evidence. The upshot might be fewer
questionable searches, less evidence, and hence, less truth. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amar</ENAMEX> gives no
reason to believe his way will be more selective in searching for "true" rather
than "false" evidence. It may prove to be a more effective deterrent to
unreasonable searches, but unless reasonableness is tautologically defined to
include only searches that turn up evidence of guilt, the more effective the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">deterrent</ENAMEX>, the less truth it is likely to uncover.

            Amar
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocates</ENAMEX> that all criminal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defendants</ENAMEX> be compelled to give pretrial
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">depositions</ENAMEX>, but his book is vague about whether these depositions would
substitute for or supplement police interrogation. In a recent public debate
with this reviewer, however, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amar</ENAMEX> stated clearly that he would accept the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">trade-off</ENAMEX> and give up police interrogation for compelled pretrial depositions.
Such a trade-off would diminish considerably the ability of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> to get
at the truth, since jailhouse interrogation in the absence of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> is more
likely to "break" a guilty <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defendant</ENAMEX> than a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtroom</ENAMEX> deposition conducted with
the assistance of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counsel</ENAMEX> is. That is why I believe that few police
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX>--or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecutors</ENAMEX>--would accept a blanket prohibition on police
interrogation in exchange for compelled pretrial depositions. They might accept
it for white-collar cases, since white-collar <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defendants</ENAMEX> almost never submit to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> interrogations. But "street" criminal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defendants</ENAMEX> do, and many waive
their <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Miranda</ENAMEX> rights and confess or provide leads. Thus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amar</ENAMEX>'s better way of
getting confessions might also produce less truth than the current approach
does.

            On the question of whether the proposals of the truth
school will denigrate other values more important than truth, we have a long
history from which to learn. If truth were the only goal of the criminal trial,
that goal would not be difficult to reach. First, we would reintroduce the
techniques of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Inquisition</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Star Chamber</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Stalinist</ENAMEX> secret
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX>. They knew how to get at the truth without any interference from civil
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">libertarians</ENAMEX> seeking to burden their single-minded pursuits with such as
privacy, bodily integrity, fairness, and civility. Throughout our history,
those who have sought the Holy Grail of truth have shown impatience with
process. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">victim</ENAMEX> in the search for truth has too often been
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">liberty</ENAMEX>.

            <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, if our only goal were
to maximize truth, we would lower the burden of proof in criminal cases from
"beyond a reasonable doubt" to "a preponderance of the evidence." Why would
anyone seeking more truth prefer "<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> guilty go free" to "one innocent ...
wrongly convicted"? Indeed, under our present rule a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jury</ENAMEX> is told that if it
believes that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defendant</ENAMEX> "probably" did it, it must acquit him, because
"probably" is not enough. A system that sought a greater quantity of truth
would instruct the fact finder to accept a disputed fact if it were more likely
than not that the fact was true.

            <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, we
would never allocate fact finding to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> randomly selected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> whose
major qualification is that they know nothing about the matter in dispute. Nor
would we allocate it to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judges</ENAMEX>, who are also not scientific <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX>. We would
have relevant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX>--<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">accountants</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineers</ENAMEX>, forensic
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX>--decide all criminal cases. We would employ the methodologies of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">science</ENAMEX>, not democracy, to arrive at justice.

            
The point is that we all agree--certainly <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amar</ENAMEX>,
who loves <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">juries</ENAMEX> and supports a high burden of proof, agrees--that our
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">democratic</ENAMEX> system of fact finding is already a compromise between the search
for truth and the search for fairness. The real question is how to strike an
appropriate balance among the often conflicting values of truth on the one hand
and considerations such as privacy and equality on the other.

            It is precisely on this
difficult issue that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amar</ENAMEX> is at his weakest. His absence of hands-on experience
with our current criminal-justice system--his lack of feel for how it actually
works--puts him at a perceptible disadvantage when seeking to strike this
exquisitely delicate balance. Nonetheless, his book is a valuable contribution
to the debate, because it gives those with experience an abstract
architectural plan against which to evaluate <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s imperfect reality of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">criminal justice</ENAMEX>.
