            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painter</ENAMEX> of the machine
age: That's the standard line on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painter</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fernand LÃ©ger</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1881-1955</TIMEX>).
It's also the theme of the retrospective--the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43 years</TIMEX> to
be devoted to him--mounted at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum of Modern Art</ENAMEX>. It's easy enough to go
along with, too, especially with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anjelica Huston</ENAMEX>'s voice purring in your ear
(<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audiotapes</ENAMEX> have replaced wall panels for this show) about how <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LÃ©ger</ENAMEX> was
peerless in portraying the feel of the modern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>.

            A hulk of
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> with a capacious appetite for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> and red <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LÃ©ger</ENAMEX> seemed the right
choice to muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> painting out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cafe</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">studio</ENAMEX> and
into the world of steel girders and factory smoke. He took elements from the
major <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20 th -century</TIMEX> schools of art--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cubism</ENAMEX>, but also <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Futurism</ENAMEX>,
Neoclassicism, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Surrealism</ENAMEX>--and forged his own peculiar idiom, one that
seemed as racy and street-smart as slang. Of the modern <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">masters</ENAMEX>, he came
closest to capturing the dynamism and rhythm of our headlong <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">century</TIMEX>.

            But beyond his up<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">-to-the-minute</TIMEX> virtuosity, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LÃ©ger</ENAMEX> doesn't
play his designated role of machine-age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hero</ENAMEX> all that convincingly. Born on a
Normandy <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">farm</ENAMEX>, the only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cattle</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">breeder</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LÃ©ger</ENAMEX> never lost a palpable
nostalgia for the countryside, reminders of which appear in some of his most
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">urban</ENAMEX> paintings--such as the incongruous tree <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branches</ENAMEX> on the elevated platform
in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Construction Workers</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1950</TIMEX>. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1900</TIMEX> he had made his way to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX>,
where he <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> trained as an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX>, then studied at a couple of traditional
art <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">academies</ENAMEX>. He fell in with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cubists</ENAMEX>, whose reverence for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CÃ©zanne</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Formalist</ENAMEX> innovations--depicting landscape and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">figures</ENAMEX> with interlocking
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planes</ENAMEX>--he shared. Later, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LÃ©ger</ENAMEX> would claim he freed himself from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CÃ</ENAMEX>©zanne by
means of abstraction; the path-breaking paintings he called <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">"Contrast of Forms</ENAMEX>"
(circa <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1913</TIMEX>)--fully abstract exercises in funnels, cylinders, and arcs--retain
all their vigorous charm.

            During
<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War I</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">LÃ©ger</ENAMEX> served for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> in the worst regions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Western Front</ENAMEX>.
It was a democratizing experience by his own account, making him feel, as he
put it in an often quoted remark, "on a level with the whole of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">French</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>." His extraordinary Card <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Game</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1917</TIMEX>) uses those "contrasting forms" to reconfigure a
traditional genre subject (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CÃ©zanne</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Card Players</ENAMEX> is the most familiar
example). LÃ©ger captures a leisurely break from the battlefield routine, but
his tin-can <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX> are still fully armored, and their cards suggest an
equation between war and a game of chance. The earth-colored table is as riven
and scarred as the trenches of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Argonne</ENAMEX>.

            After the war came The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">City</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1919</TIMEX>), probably his
single most famous painting. Some grimly monochromatic figures mount the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stairway</ENAMEX> in the center of the picture--returning <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX>, perhaps?--but
otherwise the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> seems a cheerful, colorful refuge, decked with tasteful
advertising posters. "Never has the poetry of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> machine age been so
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">grandly</ENAMEX> and proudly exalted," comments the art <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">historian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Golding</ENAMEX> in the
exhibition catalog. Maybe so, but there's something opportunistic about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LÃ©ger</ENAMEX>'s
abrupt embrace of urban life. It's as though after wrestling long and hard with
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CÃ©zanne</ENAMEX>'s dictum that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX> should paint the world of nature in terms of
spheres, cylinders, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cones</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">LÃ©ger</ENAMEX> realized: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hey</ENAMEX>, here's an environment
that's actually made of these shapes!

            The cogs
and pistons that dominate his paintings of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1920s</TIMEX> remain unusually
intimate, human-scale. It's true that he's drawn to machinery, but his favorite
devices are typewriters and accordions and siphons--nonthreatening mechanisms
that lack the depersonalizing, menacing quality of, say, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fritz Lang</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">nightmarish</ENAMEX> film <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metropolis</ENAMEX> . Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LÃ©ger</ENAMEX> was a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Communist</ENAMEX>, with
pronounced sympathy for the working <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>, his experience of factory conditions
apparently was limited to what he'd heard from his fellow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">card-</ENAMEX>playing
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX>. (His <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Realist Construction Workers</ENAMEX> was displayed in the
canteen of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renault</ENAMEX> auto <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factory</ENAMEX>, to predictably tepid response. It was the
same <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factory</ENAMEX> where the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">philosopher</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simone Weil</ENAMEX> worked <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">long hours</TIMEX> to
experience the true lot of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX>.)

            The alienation of modern life--a central theme in the work
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LÃ©ger</ENAMEX>'s literary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Miller</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blaise Cendrars</ENAMEX>--doesn't enter the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">painter</ENAMEX>'s resolutely optimistic vision. Even <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York City</ENAMEX>, where he waited out
<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX>, takes on cozy contours for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LÃ©ger</ENAMEX>, who was quickly hired by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nelson</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockefeller</ENAMEX> to decorate his <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX> (the fireplace surround is in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MoMA</ENAMEX> show). LÃ©ger saw the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1940s</TIMEX> through a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">1920s</NUMEX> temperament,
reworking a drawing of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1924</TIMEX> into his appealing oil <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Three Musicians</ENAMEX>
(<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1944</TIMEX>), a particular hit of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MoMA</ENAMEX> show. The looming skyscrapers of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Georgia</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">O'Keefe</ENAMEX>'s between-the-wars paintings or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Sheeler</ENAMEX>'s threatening
smokestacks have no counterpart in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">LÃ©ger</ENAMEX>'s work. His <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Good-bye New York</ENAMEX>
(<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1946</TIMEX>), the cover illustration for the exhibition catalog, has no urban feel at
all, despite some free-floating <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">girders</ENAMEX> and a row of neckties glimpsed at a
Times <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Square</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stall</ENAMEX>. The stray fences and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> limbs, from the upstate
countryside where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LÃ©ger</ENAMEX> spent his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summers</TIMEX>, are more prominent. Back in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX>,
he painted stilted idylls in the countryside, utopias no one would want to live
in. The most sophisticated machinery here is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bicycle</ENAMEX>.

            The story
that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MoMA</ENAMEX>'s show tells about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LÃ©ger</ENAMEX>--his heroic struggle with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CÃ©zanne</ENAMEX>, his
escape into abstraction, his flirtation with competing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Modernism</ENAMEX>,
his late monumentality--is the same story that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MoMA</ENAMEX>'s permanent collection
tells, with <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Picasso</ENAMEX> as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hero</ENAMEX>. But there's another way to think of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LÃ©ger</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX>. As the machinery shrank in his pictures, his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> grew in
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">prominence</ENAMEX> and size. So many Modernist breakthroughs involved the visual
dismantling of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>--<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Picasso's Demoiselles</ENAMEX> d'Avignon (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1907</TIMEX>) on the
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> floor of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MoMA, de Kooning's Woman</ENAMEX>, I (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1950-51</TIMEX>) on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX>--that
it should come as no surprise that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LÃ©ger</ENAMEX> began the same way, with his
systematically fragmented <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Woman in Blue</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1912</TIMEX>), the first piece in the
exhibition.

            Many of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LÃ©ger</ENAMEX>'s key paintings seem to have been inspired by
the question of what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> are, exactly. Are they companions in the human realm
or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> from the natural--or even the mechanical--world? Are they animal,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">vegetable</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mineral</ENAMEX>? The metallic moving parts of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Woman</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blue</ENAMEX> yield
to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Neoclassical</ENAMEX> contours of the marmoreal <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Three Women</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1921</TIMEX>), who
are as still as the still-life lunch they'll never eat. has a primitive, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Easter</ENAMEX>
Island look: LÃ©ger <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">paints</ENAMEX> a holly leaf in exactly the same black-on-red idiom,
as though the nude <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> is a botanical exhibit. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A decade later</TIMEX>, in his
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Composition With Two Parrots</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1935-39</TIMEX>), the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> are still bulbous and
inert, but there's <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> in their veins. The painting suggests an equation
between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> forms of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">wildlife</ENAMEX>: the clothed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> holds a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">parrot</ENAMEX>, his companion
holds a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LÃ©ger</ENAMEX>'s ideas about <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> are
inseparable from his ideas about machinery. His clever <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ballet</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MÃ©canique</ENAMEX> --an influential little non-narrative film he made in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1924</TIMEX> (MoMA
has it on a continuous reel)--intercuts dancing pistons and kitchenware with
blinking eyes and a mouth that opens and closes rhythmically. The idea, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LÃ</ENAMEX>©ger
claimed, was to prove "that machines and fragments of them, that ordinary
manufactured objects, have plastic possibilities." In other words, detached
from their familiar uses and manipulated on film, such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX> could be
animated, rendered flexible, and--in the sculptural sense--"plastic."
Conversely, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LÃ©ger</ENAMEX> was also implying that human beings are composed of moving
parts. But the blinking eyes in his mechanical ballet are heavy with mascara,
while the sexy mouth shines with lipstick. In his dreams of the future, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LÃ</ENAMEX>©ger
wanted his machines to be as sexy and intimate as beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, and his
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> to be as available and predictable as household appliances.
