            The career of the protean
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all</NUMEX>-media <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aleksandr Rodchenko</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1891-1956</TIMEX>) can be seen as a textbook
example of the seduction and betrayal of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Russian Revolution</ENAMEX>. No, he wasn't
sent to a gulag, and he wasn't shot. Rather, he lived on to see his ideals
thoroughly rubbished and himself marginalized to the point of nonexistence. But
his life and art appear inseparable from the trajectory of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Communist</ENAMEX>
experiment. To view the large, multifaceted exhibit of his work at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MoMA</ENAMEX> is at
once exhilarating and poignant--exhilarating because of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nearly 20 years</TIMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">unabating</ENAMEX> discovery, astounding energy, and constant renewal at its heart;
poignant because the main inspiration for the work was a ladderlike series of
delusions that inevitably toppled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rodchenko</ENAMEX> into the void.

            Rodchenko
was the epitome of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Constructivism</ENAMEX>, which, of all the "isms" of early
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20 th century</TIMEX> art, was the most concerned with practical matters of
the workaday world. Not all <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">avant-gardists</ENAMEX> were <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Constructivists</ENAMEX>, and
not all <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Constructivists</ENAMEX> were <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> or necessarily <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Communist</ENAMEX>. From our remove,
there appear to be many similarities among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rodchenko</ENAMEX>'s preoccupations and those
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> who stood on the other side of some ideological gulf. Kasimir
Malevich, for example, was also concerned with geometry and with purifying art
of baggage such as color, but his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Suprematism</ENAMEX> had its origin in an ascetic
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">spirituality</ENAMEX>. Many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bauhaus</ENAMEX> were, like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rodchenko</ENAMEX>,
out to remake the world beginning with the appearance of material objects, but
unlike him they did not feel the burden of responsibility toward a society in
progress.

            
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rodchenko</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> in the various
groupings of the left <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> art in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1920s</TIMEX> saw themselves as
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">embattled</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> of the true spirit of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Revolution</ENAMEX>, in the face of
various currents of reaction, mediocrity, timidity, and stasis. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vladimir</ENAMEX>
Mayakovsky was out to reinvent poetry, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vsevelod Meyerhold</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">theater</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vladimir</ENAMEX>
Tatlin the monument, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dziga Vertov</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cinema</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Viktor Shklovsky</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sergei Tretiakov</ENAMEX>
prose literature, while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rodchenko</ENAMEX>'s domain comprised advertising, illustration,
graphic design, stage design, photography, and a few other things besides.
Theirs was a revolution of the imagination, and many of their works continue to
present the vigor of that spirit even after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three-quarters</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a century</TIMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pastiches</ENAMEX> and secondhand derivations, but at the same time they present an
unhappy example of wishful thinking. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> believed that if they built
their respective corners of the new world, the rest would fill itself in and
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> would flock to inhabit it. Instead, few of them had much of a
popular base, all their careers were squelched by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stalin</ENAMEX>, and most of them were
killed.

            All of
them were radical <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Modernists</ENAMEX> well before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1917</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rodchenko</ENAMEX> was no exception.
The path of his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early years</TIMEX> is graphically shown on the walls of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MoMA</ENAMEX> as a
process of relentless stripping down, jettisoning <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> figuration, then
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ambiguity</ENAMEX>, then volume, and finally color. After his ritual immolation of the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last</TIMEX>--in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1921</TIMEX>, at a show where he exhibited panels of pure red, yellow, and
blue as a farewell gesture--he was finally ready to begin reconstruction from
the bottom, initially by way of collage. The family resemblance among his
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">collages</ENAMEX> and those being made concurrently by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>, and
even the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> provides a bracing example of what is meant by a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zeitgeist</ENAMEX> --in a time of shaky and sluggish telecommunications, several
dozen widely separated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> all hit at once on the idea of chopping up
whatever printed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ephemera</ENAMEX> lay at hand and reassembling the fragments into
dynamic compositions that reassigned their meaning. It was a scavenger's
revolution that held large promise for a time: finding potential in the most
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">random</ENAMEX> litter, making a new world out of the debris of the old.

            
Soon <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rodchenko</ENAMEX> had renounced any art divorced
from practical application and was driving down every useful <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">avenue</ENAMEX>, designing
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clothing</ENAMEX> (the factory uniform by way of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buck Rogers</ENAMEX>), printed fabrics,
newspaper <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kiosks</ENAMEX>, logotypes, magazine covers and book jackets, and printed
advertisements of all sorts. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lenin</ENAMEX> instituted the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Economic Policy</ENAMEX> in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1921</TIMEX>--which permitted a limited amount of capitalist competition in order to
restore some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>'s cash flow--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rodchenko</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mayakovsky</ENAMEX> became the
advertising <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> for many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>'s manufacturing and retail <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX>,
which, in a sense, let them have their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cake</ENAMEX> and eat it, too. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rodchenko</ENAMEX>'s
designs--in red and black, crisply diagonal, filled with visual hooks and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">slams</ENAMEX>--are still being aped <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, and some of them manage to look more modern
than anything around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">now</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mayakovsky</ENAMEX>'s apparently catchy rhymed slogans,
unfortunately, do not translate well).

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mayakovsky</ENAMEX>'s scowling,
angular, shaven-headed poetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boxer</ENAMEX>'s mug was a dramatic advertising image unto
itself, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rodchenko</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> portraits of him made him an icon (to be recycled
endlessly in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> propaganda after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mayakovsky</ENAMEX>'s dubious <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1930</TIMEX> suicide, an act
which even if self-willed was certainly nudged along by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>). The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">portraits</ENAMEX> also launched <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rodchenko</ENAMEX>'s photographic career, which, with typical
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">flair</ENAMEX>, fell effortlessly into the main currents of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Modernism</ENAMEX>. Despite
strong competition from abroad, he virtually came to own the rakish angle on
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">multistory</ENAMEX> architecture, and he shared with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> Umbo title to the
perpendicular view of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> from above. The show includes some lesser
known works as well, such as his serial shots of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moscow</ENAMEX> street peddlers, which
with their static figures and shifting traffic backdrops are like little movies
composed of stills.

            His photography was the
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> thing that got him in trouble, too, as his wildly angled close-ups of the
faces of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Young Pioneers</ENAMEX> were denounced as "grotesque" by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of
conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">art factions</ENAMEX>. Rodchenko, who for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of years</TIMEX> after the
Revolution continued to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ally</ENAMEX> himself with the soon-to-be-banned <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">anarchists</ENAMEX>, now
felt the shifting winds and bent himself to various acts of public
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">self-criticism</ENAMEX>, but even so he found himself unable to obtain permits for
street photography. He diligently applied himself to the kind of work allotted
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Stalinist</ENAMEX> era, documenting official marches and construction projects in
the hinterlands. His private pictures from the time include some classics, but
they are classics of despair. In his last <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20 years</TIMEX>, he was effectively
dead.
