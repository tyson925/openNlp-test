            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nathan Glazer</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">social</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientist</ENAMEX> and core <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> known as the New York
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Intellectuals</ENAMEX>, appears to be haunted by second thoughts. This may be a sign of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">irresolution</ENAMEX>. In a review of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glazer</ENAMEX>'s latest book, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">We Are All</ENAMEX>
Multiculturalists Now , in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Weekly Standard</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dinesh D</ENAMEX>'Souza
accuses the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> of "cowardice," of mollycoddling the multicultural left in
order to make life in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cambridge</ENAMEX> tolerable. It's true that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glazer</ENAMEX> is not the
combative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soul</ENAMEX> that, say, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norman Podhoretz</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Irving Kristol</ENAMEX> is. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glazer</ENAMEX> is a
gentleman, always ready to concede, at least rhetorically, the sincerity of his
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponent</ENAMEX>'s feelings. (He wrote a nice review of my book, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">City</ENAMEX> on a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hill</ENAMEX> ,
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Republic</ENAMEX> .) But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glazer</ENAMEX> is also too honest to disguise his own
misgivings, and his new book, painful and awkward and sometimes confused, is
the record of a reality--the reality of race and racial identity--that has
resisted the categories he has tried to impose on it throughout his career.

            Like the
rest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX> that gathered around the fabled <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Alcove 1</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">City College</ENAMEX>
cafeteria in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the '30s</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glazer</ENAMEX> started out as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trotskyist</ENAMEX>. His radicalism,
however, did not last long. In the afterglow of the war and the recovery from
the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Depression</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glazer</ENAMEX> and most of the other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Intellectuals</ENAMEX> came to see
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> as a great success story. At the heart of their optimistic liberalism
was the recognition that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> had opened itself to impoverished <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jewish</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX> like themselves, and that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX> had in turn embraced the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">democratic</ENAMEX> values, the secular rituals, and the faith in individual achievement
that made them <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>. "The complete identification of the overwhelming
majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> in each group of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> in spite of discrimination is
assured," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glazer</ENAMEX> wrote in a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1954</TIMEX> article in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Commentary</ENAMEX> , one of the
favorite journalistic forums of the ex-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">radicals</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glazer</ENAMEX> expanded on this theme in his best-known work,
Beyond the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Melting Pot: The Negroes</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Ricans</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italians</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Irish</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York City</ENAMEX> , published in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1963</TIMEX> and co-authored by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel Patrick</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moynihan</ENAMEX>. The book's central point was that, contrary to both the fears and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">faith</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the '50s</TIMEX>, mass culture was not eradicating ancient distinctions of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">religion</ENAMEX> and ethnicity. Its unspoken premise was that every ethnic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> until
then had found its own distinctive path to success. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Blacks</ENAMEX> had, in effect,
recently arrived at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of the line; they had problems, but so had the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Irish</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italians</ENAMEX>. "<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> will very likely in the end be an integrated
area," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glazer</ENAMEX> wrote.

            Then the world turned upside
down. There were riots, and the brutal reception of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moynihan</ENAMEX>'s report on the
black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ocean Hill-Brownsville</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX>' wars, and open
admissions at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">City College</ENAMEX>. In the foreword to the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1970</TIMEX> edition of the book,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> admitted they had assumed that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> would behave as, and see
themselves as, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> ethnic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> among many. They hadn't imagined that blacks
would want to be treated as something wholly new, a "racial" <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX>
wrote that they were "saddened and frightened" by the implications of this
choice, and they blamed the white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intelligentsia</ENAMEX> for legitimizing it.

            It was
<ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">race</ENAMEX>, along with revolt on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">campus</ENAMEX>, that pushed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glazer</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX> to the
right. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1975</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glazer</ENAMEX> published <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Affirmative Discrimination: Ethnic</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inequality and Public Policy</ENAMEX> , a book in which he attacked affirmative
action and decisively broke with contemporary liberalism. Affirmative action,
with its promise of government intervention to overcome the effects of
discrimination, represented a willful refusal by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> to accept "the main
pattern of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> history," the pattern of ever-expanding inclusiveness. But
when the book was reissued in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glazer</ENAMEX> wrote an introduction full of rueful
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reflections</ENAMEX>. It was becoming clear, he wrote, that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> weren't being
assimilated as others had been. Perhaps affirmative action wasn't so very
willful after all. "The underlying force that keeps the system of numerical
quotas and goals strong is the actual condition of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX>," he wrote. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Glazer</ENAMEX>
didn't think affirmative action was the answer, but he cautioned against an
"all-out assault" on the policy.

            
We <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Are All Multiculturalists Now</ENAMEX> should be read
as a book-length postscript, an agonized reconsideration. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glazer</ENAMEX> is the last
person one would expect to applaud the kind of ethnic chauvinism and
myth-mongering that often go under the name of multiculturalism, and he
doesn't. "I feel warmly attached to the old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> that was acclaimed in
school textbooks," he writes. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glazer</ENAMEX> concludes that his side has
lost--hence the title. He cites the ubiquity of the multicultural curriculum in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> and the blithe acceptance of it even by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">administrators</ENAMEX>
with no ethnic or ideological <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ax</ENAMEX> to grind. Multiculturalism, he finds, though
with only the most anecdotal evidence, has been institutionalized. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Glazer</ENAMEX>
appears to be conceding that the postwar liberal faith was misguided, and that
the pluralistic community he envisioned in Beyond the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Melting Pot</ENAMEX> has
not--and perhaps will not--come to pass.

            But
that's not quite so. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glazer</ENAMEX> observes that while the multicultural curriculum is
being propagated in the name of the new wave of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX>
themselves want to succeed on more or less the same terms as the European
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">newcomers</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">75 years ago</TIMEX>. We <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Are All Multiculturalists Now</ENAMEX> has a hidden
subject; it almost seems hidden from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glazer</ENAMEX> himself. Toward the end of this
short book, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glazer</ENAMEX> observes that it is <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX>, not <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX>, who have pushed
hardest for the multicultural curriculum. And when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glazer</ENAMEX> asks why this is so,
he finds not the obscurantism of black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">academics</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leonard Jeffries</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Asa</ENAMEX>
Hilliard, but the hard fact of black experience, and "the fundamental refusal
of other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> to accept <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX>, despite their eagerness, as suitable
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> for assimilation."

            This is, for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glazer</ENAMEX>, an almost subversive conclusion.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Conservatives</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glazer</ENAMEX> himself, have routinely called on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> to
behave like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX>. Now he is saying that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> want to follow the ethnic
pattern, but can't--and that multiculturalism is the result of that
frustration. It is this recognition that accounts for the strange air of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">passivity</ENAMEX> and gloom that dominates the book. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glazer</ENAMEX> has reached a cul-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">de</ENAMEX>-sac.
He's no more comfortable condemning multiculturalism than he is condemning
affirmative action, though he believes in neither. He is forced to say,
instead, that multiculturalism isn't the end of the world. That's certainly
true, and it's a useful corrective to all the apocalyptic literature on the
subject. But it puts <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glazer</ENAMEX> in the bizarre position of accepting the teaching
of self-esteem-enhancing myths, such as the claim that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iroquois</ENAMEX> federation
significantly influenced the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">framers</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Constitution</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glazer</ENAMEX> is right to
think that even a steady diet of ethnic special pleading won't lead to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Balkanization</ENAMEX> and intergroup warfare; but he's also right to wonder if he takes
"too extreme an outcome ... as a test against which to estimate" the likely
effects of multiculturalism. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Multiculturalism</ENAMEX> is guilty of plenty of midsize
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">wrongs</ENAMEX>, including bilingual instruction, which often keeps Spanish-speaking
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> locked in their own form of isolation, and the reduction of history to
therapy, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arthur Schlesinger</ENAMEX> put it.

            But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glazer</ENAMEX>'s underlying point
is that abolishing the multicultural curriculum, even were it possible,
wouldn't do much to diminish racial isolation; the dynamic works the other way
around. This is not, for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glazer</ENAMEX>, a "problem" with a "solution." It is a
tragedy. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glazer</ENAMEX> is still the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neoconservative</ENAMEX> who wrote The Limits of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social</ENAMEX>
Policy . He doesn't believe that any large-scale policy can increase
residential or educational integration, or raise the low level of racial
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intermarriage</ENAMEX>. He doesn't believe that racism is the cause of black isolation,
so he doesn't suggest that enlightenment is the answer. It's not easy to argue
with either of these propositions. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glazer</ENAMEX>'s own logic leaves him with
nothing to offer--except the admittedly specious comforts of multiculturalism.
We <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Are All Multiculturalists Now</ENAMEX> is thus the opposite of Beyond the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Melting Pot</ENAMEX> --a putatively neutral book with a profoundly discouraging
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subtext</ENAMEX>. And in the arc that connects the two one can read the downfall of what
was once a sustaining faith.
