            It is a curious but perhaps
essential dimension of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ralph Ellison</ENAMEX> literary myth that he published only
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> novel, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Invisible Man</ENAMEX> , and that his entire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">authority</ENAMEX> as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> and
intellectual rests on this work, which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX> felt brought black writing of
age, beyond mere protest and sociology. Ellison, who died in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX>, published no
other collections of fiction in his lifetime. Some of the fugitive pieces of
fiction he did publish in magazines and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX> are collected in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Flying</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Home</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Other Stories</ENAMEX>, along with some very early unpublished work. The
book appears during something like an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ellison</ENAMEX> revival, as the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> has
also seen the publication of a volume of his collected essays and one of his
interviews.

            The
creative-writing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX>'s clich√© is that we each have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> good novel in us.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ellison</ENAMEX> seemed to have discovered instantly that his <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> good novel was his
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>. Maybe that is why he never published his <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>, that most talked-about
advent that produced only excerpts here and there. The adulatory reception of
the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> may have made a second impossible--if <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ellison</ENAMEX> felt he had to produce
an even greater book, that is. He might have especially felt this pressure as
the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> went by and public expectation grew with the wait. Perhaps he said
everything he had to say in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Invisible Man</ENAMEX> .

            Whatever the case, the payoff from <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Invisible Man</ENAMEX> was
everything a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> could want. No black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> roughly of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ellison</ENAMEX>'s
generation--not <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Wright</ENAMEX>, not <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Langston Hughes</ENAMEX>, not Zora Neale
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hurston</ENAMEX>--was able to parlay one novel into a position of being a respected
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critic</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">theorist</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> literature. Ellison became a true intellectual
as no other black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">novelist</ENAMEX> had been. The full apparatus of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
intellectual life--the major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">universities</ENAMEX>, the literary organs, the forums for
speaking--were open to him in ways they were not even to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Baldwin</ENAMEX>, the
most noted crossover black literary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">star</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1950s</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ellison</ENAMEX> drew this
welcome partly because he was the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> to win a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Book</ENAMEX>
Award (in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1953</TIMEX>) and the only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">novelist</ENAMEX> among his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contemporaries</ENAMEX> to win <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of
the major literary prizes. In the age of integration, this endorsement of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ellison</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genius</ENAMEX> by the white mainstream meant he had "transcended" his
race.

            Yet, his
reception also had much to do with his attitude toward writing and toward race.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ellison</ENAMEX> believed firmly in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX>'s detachment from politics and political
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">engagement</ENAMEX>, in the primacy of aesthetics over the political and sociological
dimensions of literature. These beliefs are reasonable enough, even liberating
for black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> burdened by the political demands of their race. But they
were also in concord with the dogma of the white literary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">establishment</ENAMEX> (a
dogma that persists to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this day</TIMEX>): that art should transcend the social
conditions that produced it. The white <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">literati appreciated Ellison</ENAMEX> because he
didn't drag the bugaboo of race into the literary act. "I wasn't, and am not,"
he said, "concerned with injustice, but with art."

            
With <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> exception, all the stories in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Flying Home</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Other Stories</ENAMEX> were written before <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Invisible Man</ENAMEX> ,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">from the late 1930s</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the middle 1940s</TIMEX>. Thus, the tendency is to see the
stories not in their own right, judging them strictly on the basis of their own
strengths and weaknesses as short fiction, but as adumbrations of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Invisible</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Man</ENAMEX> . The less-fair question is: Would these stories have been published if
some unknown <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> had written them? Are they worthy of our attention when
considered apart from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> who wrote them?

            This is
not easy to answer. These are obviously apprentice works, the equivalent of
art-book sketches, practice-room exercises. Ellison was clearly trying to learn
how to write fiction. And while it is true that no <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>, no matter how
accomplished, ever ceases to struggle with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">craft</ENAMEX> of writing, there is
surely a difference between that stage when one is fumbling around, trying to
discover if one can even be a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX>, and the stage where one is fully
confident of addressing the world as nothing but a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX>, because one is as
compelled to write as to breathe. Isn't the entire premise of this collection
based on the idea that they suggest a culmination, an arrival, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Invisible</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Man</ENAMEX> ?

            Some of the adumbrations of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Invisible Man</ENAMEX> are not
hard to spot. The old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who tells of his dream of flying around heaven in
"<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Flying Home</ENAMEX>" obviously is a prototype of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trueblood</ENAMEX>, the novel's storytelling,
incestuous black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmer</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aunt Kate</ENAMEX> in "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">That I Had the Wings</ENAMEX>" suggests <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mary</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rambo</ENAMEX>, the down-home black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> who nurses the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Invisible Man</ENAMEX> back to
health.

            But such a
literary game does not address the significance of these stories. What is of
moment here is how much in these stories <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ellison</ENAMEX> struggled to find his own
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">voice</ENAMEX>, not to replicate, say, the voice of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Wright</ENAMEX>, but to use Wrightian
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> in an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Ellisonian</ENAMEX> way, as he did in "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A Party</ENAMEX> Down at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Square</ENAMEX>," a
story about a lynching and an airplane crash told from the point of view of a
visiting white adolescent. Here <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ellison</ENAMEX> uses <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wright</ENAMEX>'s preoccupation with
interracial violence and graphic, near-surrealist detailing to provide the
reader an ironic, ambiguous tale of a white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX>, a moral innocent, coming of
age. "A <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Hard Time Keeping Up</ENAMEX>" is very much a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chester Himes</ENAMEX>-type of hard-boiled
story told through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ellison</ENAMEX>'s prism. Taking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Himes</ENAMEX>' unromantic, harsh view of
black urban underground life, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ellison</ENAMEX> delivers a payoff not of violence but of
a seeming violence that is, in fact, comic.

            
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ellison</ENAMEX> wrote these stories after having
abandoned a career in music for one in literature. He was reading a great deal,
trying to establish his literary ancestry and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ascertain</ENAMEX> precisely the kind of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> he could be. The struggle with influences and the experiments with
points of view, narrative mode, characterization, realism, surrealism,
vernacular language, and the like is all very natural--even predictable--and
thus, baldly apparent here. There are several stories about "riding the rods,"
as illegally riding <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trains</ENAMEX> was called (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ellison</ENAMEX> did this as a college <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX>),
as well as tales about growing up in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Midwest</ENAMEX>, with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ellison</ENAMEX> making use of
his <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oklahoma</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">upbringing</ENAMEX>. We see the apprentice <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> trying to transform his
raw autobiography into art, with varying success.

            Of the
notable stories in this collection, "A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coupla Scalped Indians</ENAMEX>," published in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1956</TIMEX> and possibly a fragment for a new novel, is the biggest disappointment,
since it is the latest <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Ellison</ENAMEX> work here. The unnamed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">narrator</ENAMEX> seems to be the
same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">narrator</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Invisible Man</ENAMEX> , and the story seems to
replicate what was done in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> novel. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buster</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">narrator</ENAMEX> are
camping out in the woods, in a male initiation ceremony like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Australian</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">walkabout</ENAMEX>. What <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ellison</ENAMEX> is doing here, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hemingway</ENAMEX> did, is equating the
process of becoming an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX> with that of becoming a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>. Throughout the
story, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ellison</ENAMEX> uses the symbol of horns, investing them with a number of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">meanings</ENAMEX> relating to sexual desire (the horny young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX>), artistic creation
(the instrument of jazz), and masculinity (the symbol of a bull). But the
symbolism ultimately overwhelms the story. The story seems self-conscious,
heavy-handed in its intimations of meaning via symbols, preoccupied not with
its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> but with its intention of being larger than itself.

            The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> most successful stories here, "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">That I Had the</ENAMEX>
Wings" and "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Flying Home</ENAMEX>," are less self-conscious than "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A Coupla</ENAMEX> Scalped
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indians</ENAMEX>." They show Ellison exploring black folklore as a source for black
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fiction</ENAMEX>, using flight, for example, as a metaphor for escape--a common trope
among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">slaves</ENAMEX> who imagined themselves able to fly back to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
stories further illustrate the unease, even hostility, that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> have tended
to feel about their folklore, and about black history generally: In "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">That I Had</ENAMEX>
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wings</ENAMEX>," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Riley</ENAMEX>, a young black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ellison</ENAMEX> uses in several stories, hates his
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aunt Kate</ENAMEX> and wishes she "had died back in slavery times"; in "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Flying Home</ENAMEX>,"
the black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilot</ENAMEX> who seeks escape hates the black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmer</ENAMEX> who rescued him after
his crash. In <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Invisible Man , the Talented Tenth</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">narrator</ENAMEX> must overcome
not only the various ideologies that are presented to him as masks or
subversions of identity, but also the various roles and prescriptions for
leadership his own <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">race</ENAMEX> wishes him to fulfill. Similarly, in these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> stories,
the pilot and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> are, in effect, fighting against the power of race
consciousness as a form of conformity, even as they are trying to find their
meaning through their race.

            These stories particularly
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">reveal Ellison</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concerns</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX>'s complex confrontation with his
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">society</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, and the way they assign him roles and identities.
Ellison was not, by any means, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> to explore these issues.
But he was among the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> to explore them with a level of intellectual verve
and artistic sophistication that suggested to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> and the world that there
was, within the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> dilemma of race, not only the expression of mere local
and immediate political protest but the broad and rich possibilities of the
human condition itself. Whatever the merit of these stories, it is certainly
clear from them how <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ellison</ENAMEX> was able to write his masterpiece, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Invisible</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Man</ENAMEX> .
