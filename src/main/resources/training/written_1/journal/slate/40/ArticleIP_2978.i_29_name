            The appearance of a new
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Muriel Spark</ENAMEX> novel is like a birth in one of those large artistic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> that
run to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genius</ENAMEX> and oddness: the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">BrontÃ«s, the Redgraves, the Beach Boys</ENAMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackson</ENAMEX> brood. <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Reality and Dreams</ENAMEX> shares its build and many of its
features and gestures with such brilliant blood relations as Memento
Mori , <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie , and A Far Cry</ENAMEX> from
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kensington</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spark</ENAMEX>'s flawless explorations of mortality, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hero</ENAMEX> worship, and
literary politics, respectively.

            Of
course, not every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of a distinguished <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> is equally appealing.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Branwell BrontÃ</ENAMEX>« drank and raved. Similarly, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Reality and Dreams</ENAMEX> is not
Spark's most pleasant novel. Its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hero</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Richards</ENAMEX>, is a filmmaker with a
passion for controlling things. He has trouble distinguishing between his
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fictions</ENAMEX> and his real life, doing his best to manipulate both, and he's hard to
warm to.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Spark</ENAMEX> brings complicated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> to mind partly because of
the familial structure she gives her novels. She favors a huge cast bound
sometimes by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> and marriage, sometimes by more casual connections, such as
geography or religious beliefs. As in a real <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> struggle
for ascendance, while <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one or two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Prospero</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">figures</ENAMEX> believe they can yank the
others around. So <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Richards</ENAMEX> is something of a Spark type. Also as in real
life, these <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Prosperos</ENAMEX> are not always right about how much they can control.
When <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Reality and Dreams</ENAMEX> opens, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom</ENAMEX> has just fallen from a high place--a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">crane</ENAMEX> where he liked to sit and "shout orders through the amplifier and like
God watch the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> down there <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> and re-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> as bidden. Especially those
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> top <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stars</ENAMEX> and the upstart minor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stars</ENAMEX>, with far too much money, thinking
they could direct the film better themselves."

            Confined to his bed with a
broken hip and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> broken ribs, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom</ENAMEX> frets about his interrupted movie and
receives visits from his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>. There's his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Claire</ENAMEX>, wealthy and
generous; his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Claire</ENAMEX>, self-righteous <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marigold</ENAMEX>, whom he calls "an
unfrocked <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priest</ENAMEX> of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>"; his beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> by his first marriage,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cora</ENAMEX>; and various <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spouses</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lovers</ENAMEX>, past, present, and future, his and
theirs.

            The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> squabble like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">siblings</ENAMEX>, jealous regardless of whether they have
cause to be. Perhaps rightly, few of them believe there's enough money,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">security</ENAMEX>, fame, power, and love to go around. The menace of deprivation haunts
the book like a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bourgeois</ENAMEX> anxiety dream. Character after <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX>, although
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">well-connected</ENAMEX>, well-educated, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">well-to-do</ENAMEX>, is laid off work, or "made
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">redundant</ENAMEX>." The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> respond tellingly, either gloating, helping, or
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">scheming</ENAMEX>. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cora</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnny</ENAMEX>, gets the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ax</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom ruminates</ENAMEX>, "I am glad
... that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnny</ENAMEX> has been made redundant. I am glad with the gladness of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lover</ENAMEX> of truth: the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> has always been superfluous." Later, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnny</ENAMEX> comes to
see him: "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom</ENAMEX> said, 'If you think I am a stone that you shouldn't leave
unturned, you are wasting your time.' "

            
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Reality and Dreams</ENAMEX> has a typical Spark plot,
artificial and suspenseful as a mystery thriller, full of clues and malice, yet
elusively allegorical. Its apparent <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marigold</ENAMEX>'s mysterious
disappearance on Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">85</NUMEX>, almost exactly halfway through the book, after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom</ENAMEX>
has recovered from his fall and finished his movie. Is <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Marigold</ENAMEX> dead, or just
trying to get attention? Leave it to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Spark character</ENAMEX> to try to seize center
stage by vanishing. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marigold</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>, who never noticed her much except to
deplore her, are forced to think about her, and her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> discovers that she
has "[s]<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">triking</ENAMEX> looks, not good-looking in fact plain ugly. But striking."

            But in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spark</ENAMEX>'s world,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">appearances</ENAMEX> (and disappearances) are deceiving. Sometimes what seems to be
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">central</ENAMEX> is really peripheral, and a throwaway plot point turns out to be the
story's symbolic heart. As the book opens, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom</ENAMEX> is working on a movie about a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rich</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who sees a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> flipping <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">burgers</ENAMEX> at a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">campsite</ENAMEX> and decides to leave
her a vast fortune. It's based on his own experience, a moment when he caught
sight of such a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> and had an impulse to give her all his money (or rather,
all his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>'s money, since the family money actually belongs to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Claire</ENAMEX>). The
focus of his movie, however, winds up being not the hamburger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX>, but the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">benefactor</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girlfriend</ENAMEX>, who is played by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rose</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">star</ENAMEX> with huge box-office
draw.

            When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom</ENAMEX> begins an affair
with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rose</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actress</ENAMEX> who plays the hamburger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> becomes jealous. "I was
deliberately photographed in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-profile all the time, so I wouldn't be
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">recognised</ENAMEX>. The light always, always, blotted me <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> out," she complains to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Claire</ENAMEX>.

            "You were
meant to be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> blotted out," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Claire</ENAMEX> tells her.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Memento Mori</ENAMEX> was about death; <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Reality and Dreams</ENAMEX> is
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about</NUMEX> a sort of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> death: being made redundant, being <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> blotted out. Spark
was in her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prime</ENAMEX> when she wrote <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Memento Mori</ENAMEX> . As she draws closer to
mortality (may it be many novels away!), she has taken up the question from the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">perspective</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX>. Is it possible, she asks, to become famous while
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">disappearing</ENAMEX>? What happens to an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX> whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> refuse to cooperate?
Just who is in charge, anyway? And (as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom</ENAMEX> wonders in the book's opening line)
are we all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> in one of God's dreams?

            We know,
of course, whose dreams <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> in. By putting the question in his
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mouth</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spark</ENAMEX> is implicitly comparing herself to God. Similarly, her title
teases her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX>, inviting us to draw parallels between her personal history
and the story she tells in the novel, though she declines to supply the
necessary details about her life. ( <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Curriculum Vitae</ENAMEX> , the memoir she
published <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few years ago</TIMEX>, politely fends off the curious.) Such
self-referential questions can be pointless and irritating, and books that
dwell on them generally belong in a category that one <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> of mine calls "art
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about</NUMEX> art supplies." Unfortunately, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Reality and Dreams</ENAMEX> doesn't transcend
this category. The main <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> are too mean to care about, and it's painful
to watch everyone pick on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marigold</ENAMEX>--even her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>--whether or not she
deserves it. Still, for barbed wisdom, surprises, and technique, there's no one
like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spark</ENAMEX>. If she wants to write a sketch of her pencil box, I for one will
gladly read it.
