            I don't have any statistics
handy for purposes of comparison, but if this isn't the largest retrospective
exhibition ever mounted, it is certainly the biggest I've ever seen. The uptown
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guggenheim</ENAMEX> is almost entirely filled by the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> part, with only one of the
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">side galleries</ENAMEX> devoted to items from the permanent collection. Part
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> takes up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floors</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SoHo</ENAMEX> annex; and the adjunct at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Ace Gallery</ENAMEX>,
while a single work, consists of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">189</NUMEX> parts and measures <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">roughly 1,000 feet</NUMEX> in
length. If the task of viewing all this isn't a sufficient workout, there are
also <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> concurrent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rauschenberg</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">gallery</ENAMEX> shows, a series of frescoes and an
exhibit of photographs, at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pace Wildenstein MacGill</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> on
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">57 th Street</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rauschenberg</ENAMEX> is an amazingly
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">prolific</ENAMEX> and formally venturesome <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX> who, over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past 50 years</TIMEX>, has
nearly always risked aesthetic trespass, producing work deliberately just one
degree or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> from being merely ugly, banal, kitschy, gimmicky, showy, facile
or, of course, excessive. Those possibilities were what he was pitting himself
against while his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contemporaries</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1950s</TIMEX>, for example, were battling the
picture <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX>. When he has won, he has won spectacularly. He hasn't, however,
always won. He did have an astonishing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25 years or so</TIMEX>, though. At least the
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three-quarters</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Lloyd Wright</ENAMEX> spiral and its sideways
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">annexes</ENAMEX>--traveling up--display one dazzling triumph of eye over reflex after
another, some of them iconic by now, others seldom shown and vitally fresh.

            Although some very good work
predates it, you might say that the show symbolically begins with his Erased
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Kooning</ENAMEX> 
               Drawing of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1953</TIMEX>. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Click</ENAMEX> on each thumbnail to see an
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enlargement</ENAMEX>.) It is exactly that: a few smudged traces of pencil on an
elaborately matted and framed piece of paper. This work has always been cited
as a classic killing-the-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> act or a declaration of independence from the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dogma of Abstract Expressionism</ENAMEX>. It is both those things, but it is also a
declaration of independence from drawing. He did a bit of it early on, but soon
realized that he had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> stronger suits, junk assemblage and photography.

            He is a virtuoso of both. He
might actually be considered a great neglected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">photographer</ENAMEX>, although this
neglect is only a consequence of the fame of his combine paintings and prints
("combine paintings" is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rauschenberg</ENAMEX>'s own term for works that include both oil
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX> on canvas). The photographs in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> show are primarily tough,
direct found-object still-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lifes</ENAMEX>, clearly descended from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walker Evans</ENAMEX> and
related to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Frank</ENAMEX>. His interest in both depicting and displaying found
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">objects</ENAMEX> also links him to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Evans</ENAMEX>, who, toward the end of his life, was taking
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> and hanging up the bullet-riddled stop signs he found on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> rather
than just taking their pictures. Rauschenberg, however, was compelled to alter
such objects, attaching them to canvas, smearing them with paint, and combining
them with all manner of other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substances</ENAMEX>. The wall captions in this show are
much more entertaining than those things usually are, viz.: Odalisk
(<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1955-58</TIMEX>), a combine that includes "<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX>, watercolor, pencil, crayon, paper,
fabric, photographs, printed reproductions, miniature blueprint, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">metal</ENAMEX>,
newspaper, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glass</ENAMEX>, dried <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">grass</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steel wool</ENAMEX>, with pillow, wood post, electric
lights, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Plymouth Rock</ENAMEX> rooster, on wood structure mounted on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">casters</ENAMEX>."

            You can imagine the fun
Rauschenberg must have had finding random detritus on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>, dragging it
up to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">loft</ENAMEX>, and then figuring out the most perversely elegant ways to put
it together. There are a few <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">studio</ENAMEX> pictures in the vast catalog, but none,
unfortunately, shows the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">nest</ENAMEX> of tennis balls, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX>, stuffed
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX>, cheesy bedspreads, and construction debris that must have filled the
place in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1950s</TIMEX>. Lately a great deal has been made of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rauschenberg</ENAMEX>'s
discretion regarding his sex life, with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> zeroing in on Bed
(<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1955</TIMEX>), a combine that includes a paint- and pencil-enhanced pillow, quilt, and
sheet; as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canyon</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1959</TIMEX>), which features, among other things, a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mirror</ENAMEX>, a pillow in a noose, and a stuffed bald eagle in full wingspread. Those
works are presumably meant to be <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Realist</ENAMEX> and Symbolist (respectively) allusions
to his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homosexual</ENAMEX> identity, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rauschenberg</ENAMEX> is chided for not publicly
affirming the same. And such allusions they may well be, although you do wonder
how those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> would then interpret the iconic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monogram</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1955-59</TIMEX>),
with its stuffed angora goat wearing a car tire around its midriff.

            The quest for meaning, a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX>'s game, looks pretty pale amid the panache and humor of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rauschenberg</ENAMEX>'s assemblages and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">combines</ENAMEX>. They involve Dada nose-thumbing,
Expressionist brio, an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> appreciation of pure <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">funk</ENAMEX>, a flâneur 's
eye for chance and juxtaposition in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sensualist</ENAMEX>'s feeling for the
most outré kinds of texture, and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">scopophiliac</ENAMEX>'s unquenchable thirst for
images, all kinds, right now, from industrial logos to comic strips to postage
stamps to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Velázquez's Rokeby Venus</ENAMEX> . (He also, incidentally, has quite an
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ear</ENAMEX>, capable of doing more with a one-word title-- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rebus</ENAMEX> ,
Currency , Interview , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barge , Express</ENAMEX> --than most
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX>.) Meaning has actually tended to be a pitfall for him, as is shown by
his topical posters, only one of which is displayed here, a dully literal item
for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Day 1970</TIMEX>.

            The lower level of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guggenheim SoHo</ENAMEX> displays the tinkering side of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rauschenberg</ENAMEX>'s nature, the works
he made in collaboration with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineers</ENAMEX>--the star item there is unquestionably
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mud Muse</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1968-71</TIMEX>), a vat of bentonite (an artificial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">clay</ENAMEX>) that bubbles
and gurgles and spits, like a pool of quicksand in a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tarzan</ENAMEX> movie, triggered by
a sound-activated compressed-air system. This kind of stuff is engaging and,
occasionally, more than that. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Upstairs</ENAMEX>, and on the very highest tiers of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">uptown</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX>, is where the trouble starts. Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last 20 years or so</TIMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rauschenberg</ENAMEX> has repeated himself, a lot. This may be par for the course of
most artistic careers; the distinction here is that he has repeated himself in
ever more exalted and expensive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> (reflective <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">metals</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> ceramics,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fresco</ENAMEX>), which just gild the funk, sapping its life. When employing his
habitual paper and canvas and burlap bags he has tended to go for discordantly
smooth finishes. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Ace Gallery</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">installation</ENAMEX>, a work in progress that will
eventually reach <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a quarter mile</NUMEX> in length, is a recapitulation of themes that
winds up being reductive in its very gigantism. Meanwhile, the best of the
later work is the very simplest, made from discarded gas-station signs. Maybe
he should just limit himself to materials that cost <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">no more than five</NUMEX> bucks a
pound.
