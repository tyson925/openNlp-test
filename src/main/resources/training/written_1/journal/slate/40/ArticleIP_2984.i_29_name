            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philip Roth</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pastoral</ENAMEX> arrived in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bookstores</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few weeks ago</TIMEX>, and I have been hearing
about it ever since. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> regales me over lunch with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philip Roth</ENAMEX>'s inflamed
passion against <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> innocence. Someone else telephones to discuss the
radicalism of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s</TIMEX>, generational warfare, and the intricacies of
black-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> relations in industrial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Jersey</ENAMEX>, as depicted by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philip Roth</ENAMEX>. A
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mailman</ENAMEX> stops me in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>--I'm not making this up--to expound his own
deduction from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philip Roth</ENAMEX>'s tale of family calamity, to wit, that without a
clear sense of God, modern <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> are doomed to lose their bearings and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">society</ENAMEX> will go to hell. The mailman, it's true, has not yet read the novel,
only the reviews, and our lively conversation (many skyward hand gestures)
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">veers</ENAMEX> in theological directions alien to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Pastoral</ENAMEX> . But I cite
the theological detour to show what is going on these days every time I pick up
the phone or loll about on the springtime <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sidewalk</ENAMEX>.

            The novel
itself, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roth</ENAMEX>'s fulmination against <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> innocence, is mostly a portrait of
a single personage, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Jersey</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ladies</ENAMEX>'-glove <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Seymour</ENAMEX>
Levov, "the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Swede</ENAMEX>"--a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> of exasperating conventionality,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">serene</ENAMEX>, handsome, athletic, bland, shallow, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who seems to have been
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">extracted</ENAMEX>, as if by a blender, from the onion-and-garlic world of the immigrant
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX>, until <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">every last</TIMEX> hint of taste and texture have finally disappeared. And
on this perfectly nice and liberal-minded <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">businessman</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roth</ENAMEX>, in his malicious
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rage</ENAMEX>, has bestowed a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">monster</ENAMEX> of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX>, a stuttering left-wing bomb thrower
and murderous lunatic destined to ruin her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daddy</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> and his life--just to
show what comes of so much cheer and post-ethnic <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> optimism.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Swede</ENAMEX> is a great <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX>. I can't say that I entirely
understand him, his placidity and easy manner--but then, nobody understands
him. Is he mad--to be so passive and smiley in our world of tragedy and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">foreboding</ENAMEX>? Or merely stupid? Not even the world-famous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">novelist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nathan</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zuckerman</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roth</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">narrator</ENAMEX>, can figure it out. About the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Swede</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roth</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zuckerman</ENAMEX> writes, "Something had turned him into a human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">platitude</ENAMEX>." But the
motive factor remains elusive. "All that rose to the surface was more surface."
It was clever of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roth</ENAMEX> to come up with such a personality and to send him
wandering around the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Jersey</ENAMEX> wilds. But the peculiar virtue of this
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">characterless</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> is that he requires <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roth</ENAMEX> to write about him in an
ever-shifting series of tones, each more precise than the last, in an effort to
define what cannot be defined.

            There are
passages where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roth</ENAMEX>, describing the rural <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Jersey</ENAMEX> landscape from within the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Swede</ENAMEX>'s benign imagination, produces a fine, sugary lyricism that is not more
than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 percent</NUMEX> ironic--a lyricism of white pasture fences and rolling hay
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fields</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Swede</ENAMEX> pretending to be <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnny Appleseed</ENAMEX>, tossing his imaginary
seed. Then again, there are passages of dark fury--the outraged indignation of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Swede</ENAMEX>'s wised-up <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerry</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Miami</ENAMEX> heart <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">surgeon</ENAMEX>, who can't stand
the innocence any longer, and whose drumbeat imprecations achieve a kind of
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">poetry:</ENAMEX>

            What
are you? Do you know? What you are is you're always trying to smooth things
over. What you are is always trying to be moderate. What you are is never
telling the truth if you think it's going to hurt someone's feelings. ... The
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> who abides everything patiently. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> with the ultimate decorum. ...
Decorum. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Decorum</ENAMEX> is what you spit in the face of. Well, your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX>
spit in it for you, didn't she?

            Or this, even louder (an ability to turn up the volume is
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roth</ENAMEX>'s special strengths), again in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerry</ENAMEX>'s voice:

            You think you know what a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> is? You have no idea what a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> is. You think you know what a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> is? You have no idea what a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> is. You think you know
what this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> is? You have no idea what this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> is. You have a
false image of everything . All you know is what a fucking glove is. This
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> is frightening .

            I could
cite <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a dozen</NUMEX> other tones--of pleading impatience, of emotional exhaustion, of
inveigling desperation, and so forth--every possible reaction to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Swede</ENAMEX> and
his predicament. I wonder if <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roth</ENAMEX> himself appreciates how lively and persuasive
these tones are, how vividly they conjure up the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Swede</ENAMEX>'s reality. In any case,
as if still unsatisfied, around these tones <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roth</ENAMEX> has orchestrated a still
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vaster</ENAMEX> range of side topics--ethnic sociology (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Irish</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WASPs</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intermarriage</ENAMEX>), industrial history (glove-making craftsmanship and its decline,
recounted at length), political debate (the crimes of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Presidents Johnson</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX>, the migraine rhetoric of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Angela Davis</ENAMEX>), and more, some of it rendered
with exquisite precision, which is fun to read.

            The details do pile up, though, until you begin to think
about the research that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roth</ENAMEX> must have undertaken, which is always a bad sign.
Then he compounds his error by investing these background details with
portentous meanings about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> and its history, and he compounds the
compound by overheating the plot (you will have to discover the details for
yourself). By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end</TIMEX>, he is delivering verdicts like this: "The outlaws are
everywhere. They're inside the gates." Or: He tells us that "the real subject"
is one of "wantonness and betrayal and deception, of treachery and disunity
among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>, the subject of cruelty. The mockery of human
integrity, every ethical obligation destroyed."

            So here is a novel that is
not only about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the '60s</TIMEX> but exudes a distinctly '60s fume of windy prophetic
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">curse-hurling.</ENAMEX> A good idea, all puffed up, which is a bad idea. The result is
fascinating without being exactly moving. A terrific book, halfway undermined.
But I don't want to make too much of my complaints, given that, in my little
circle of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>, no error or misjudgment on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roth</ENAMEX>'s part appears to have
inhibited anyone's desire to subject <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Pastoral</ENAMEX> to analytic
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vivisection</ENAMEX>. Mayhem, family collapse, the occasional terrorist <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bomb</ENAMEX>, mad
government policies, human platitudes--in this pleasant springtime of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>,
these, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roth</ENAMEX> renders them, do seem to be everyone's favorite topics of
conversation.
