<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tribune</ENAMEX>, in a front-page article from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Singapore</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michael</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richardson</ENAMEX>, reported that the fierce austerity programs being demanded of
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Monetary Fund</ENAMEX> "could ignite virulent
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">anti-Americanism</ENAMEX>" and "create dangerous instability in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX>." But it was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asian</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX>, not the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>, who seemed for the moment to be taking the
strain.

            The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South China Morning Post</ENAMEX>
talked of "unprecedented diplomatic pressure" being imposed on the increasingly
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">insecure</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Suharto</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indonesia</ENAMEX>, who, it said, was awaiting further
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">frantic</ENAMEX>, bossy telephone calls (following those he had already received from
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prime Minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Howard</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australia</ENAMEX>) from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japanese</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prime Minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ryutaro Hashimoto</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chancellor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helmut Kohl</ENAMEX>. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guardian of London</ENAMEX>
devoted its editorial <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX> to demanding <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Suharto</ENAMEX>'s resignation.

            The main
editorial of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manila</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> was devoted, on the other hand, to congratulating
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philippines</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fidel V. Ramos</ENAMEX>, for canceling a planned trip
to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Switzerland</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Belgium</ENAMEX>. But the congratulations contained more than a hint
of sarcasm. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">The trip</ENAMEX> would have been his <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">34 th</NUMEX> abroad during his <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">67</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> in office, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX> said; and "[o]n every trip, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX>--with
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Lady</ENAMEX> on occasion--brings with him at least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">security</ENAMEX> and personal staff, as befits the powers and responsibilities of his
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>."

            That was
not counting the inevitable "business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">delegation</ENAMEX>" composed of representatives
of government-owned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">financial institutions</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manila</ENAMEX>
Times added, pointing out that "<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every single</TIMEX> presidential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aide</ENAMEX> or factotum
gets <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2,000</NUMEX> in allowance for a trip," meaning "<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$200,000</NUMEX> going down the drain
for allowances alone," on top of which there were the air fares, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hotel</ENAMEX> bills,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">rented</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> and communications equipment, phone bills, "etcetera."

            
"He [the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>] might have thought ... that
canceling his trip could send the wrong signals to the world that we are going
under. Possibly so. Or worse, they might think we have slid down to utter
poverty, we can't even finance our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief executive</ENAMEX>'s voyages overseas," the
newspaper continued.

            "What, we
poor? In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the days</TIMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aquino</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>, there was one <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> in fact
who--to justify his purchase of electric massage pillows--had the temerity to
say 'we are a rich <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> pretending to be poor.' For a long while it did seem
like we, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, were consigned to endure poverty, while our leaders
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">wallowed</ENAMEX> in assumed wealth at our expense. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> has shown a fine
example."

            In the continuing <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Algerian</ENAMEX> crisis, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">London Sunday</ENAMEX>
newspaper the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Observer</ENAMEX> made waves across <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> by claiming that "at
least some of the massacres in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Algeria</ENAMEX> are the work of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>'s military
security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX>." "<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">policemen</ENAMEX> seeking asylum in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> told the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Observer</ENAMEX> they took part in massacres and torture of defenceless
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX>, under orders," the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX> said. "The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">defectors</ENAMEX> said special
forces disguised as 'fundamentalists' with beards and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX> dress slaughtered
entire <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the middle of the night</TIMEX>."

            In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>, where the trouble
in its former <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX> continued to occupy many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX>-column inches, the
principal Paris <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>, the conservative Le <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Figaro</ENAMEX>, carried an interview
with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Algerian Islamic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> (FIS) that won the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Algerian</ENAMEX>
election, only to see the result quashed and its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> jailed for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five years</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abdelkader Hachani</ENAMEX> condemned the massacres as "crimes against humanity" and
said that, by rejecting a political solution and refusing to protect the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">population</ENAMEX>, "the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> bears a large part of the responsibility."

            In its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekend</TIMEX> edition,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Le Monde</ENAMEX> carried a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">front-page</ENAMEX> article about "the incredible record of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South African</ENAMEX>
prison system," from which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">700</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prisoners</ENAMEX> have escaped in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past two months</TIMEX>
alone. This was not so surprising, it said, when it was taken into account
that, "according to official statistics, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX> public order <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> have
been charged with crimes and offences of various <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kinds</ENAMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 1996</TIMEX>, and
that, according to a recent opinion poll, the majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">South Africans</ENAMEX> no
longer have either respect for or confidence in their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX>."
