            The showing of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinton</ENAMEX>
videotapes on television was roundly condemned across <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</TIMEX>, where
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">press</ENAMEX> was as lavish in its praise of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> as it was
contemptuous of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Le Monde</ENAMEX> published a front-page
cartoon of a cameraman filming inside the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>'s trousers, while its
editorial, titled <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">"The American Pillory</ENAMEX>," condemned <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth Starr</ENAMEX>'s
"persecution" of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> and the broadcasting of the grand jury
videotapes as the equivalent of "a public execution." It said the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX>
in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> have abandoned the principles of justice, "which used to do honor
to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> democracy, which is ordinarily more respectful than ours is of
individual rights." It concluded, "There is no mystery anymore. The law in this
case is no more than a cover for a political offensive working methodically to
destroy a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>--and, by so doing, to undermine a democracy."

            In an
interview with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekly</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Die Zeit</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chancellor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helmut Kohl</ENAMEX>
refused to comment on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s relationship with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monica Lewinsky</ENAMEX> or on any
other aspect of his private life, saying these are the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>'s "own
affair." But he did say that "the way in which the world is following, with
hypocritical eagerness, all the most private details on the Internet is
something--and I don't use the expression casually--that makes me vomit. With
all the problems that we have, from the financial crisis in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX> to genocide in
central <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX> and the civil war in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kosovo</ENAMEX>, I really hope that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Americans</ENAMEX>
can pull their socks up and be capable of acting."

            In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">La</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Repubblica of Rome</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">correspondent</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vittorio Zucconi</ENAMEX> wrote that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s fate lies in the hands of an "electronic god": "A democratic
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> is mortally threatened by the same medium, television, that 38 years
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ago</TIMEX> helped construct the myth of another <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democratic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s idol
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John F. Kennedy</ENAMEX>." He added, "The reality of contemporary democracy
is this: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Everywhere</ENAMEX>, fewer and fewer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> and more and more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewers</ENAMEX>."

            In
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Stampa of Turin</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gabriele Romagnoli</ENAMEX> wrote from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s destiny is in the hands
of the "strange, wonderful, deceived <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, who continue to form a
dam against the torrent of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mud</ENAMEX> poured out by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth Starr</ENAMEX> onto the president
they elected, onto the TV sets in their homes, onto the screens of their
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>'s computers." Their verdict after this "day of shame and passion" will
depend on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Jones</ENAMEX> index and "on the other mysterious variables that pass
through the mind and spirit of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>, delightful because
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">unpredictable</ENAMEX>," he concluded.

            
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX>, the liberal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guardian</ENAMEX> said that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s
"<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> can no longer claim this is freedom and democracy in action; it
is a witch-hunt, pure and simple. No life would stand up to <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this minute</TIMEX>
examination, this moment-by-moment dismantling." In an editorial, it added, "It is painful, pathetic, pointless, serving
only to create a flood of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McCarthyite</ENAMEX> smear and counter-smear; the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX>
want <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX>, preferably blood tested for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>. The only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to
emerge with any credit from this sordid saga are the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, who
continue to show the sound sense they have demonstrated throughout."

            The same view was expressed
on the editorial page of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sunday Times of London</ENAMEX> by conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">columnist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferdinand Mount</ENAMEX>,
who also said it will be "a sad day for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Constitution</ENAMEX> if he
[<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>] is forced out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> on the evidence we now have": "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">That</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">constitution</ENAMEX> has its faults (as does our own), but it is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bedrock</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> know how to appreciate it even if some of
their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> do not." On the op-ed page, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Harris</ENAMEX>, previewing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tony</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blair</ENAMEX>'s meeting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>, said the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> prime
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minister</ENAMEX> will unveil "a whole new kind of politics, unlike anything seen before
in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>." He described a new pamphlet by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blair</ENAMEX> on "The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Third Way</ENAMEX>" as
"potentially even revolutionary"--"either breathtaking, or sinisterly
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Orwellian</ENAMEX>, or both, depending on your point of view." <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blair</ENAMEX> proposes
"reconciliating themes that in the past have wrongly been regarded as
antagonistic--patriotism and internationalism; rights and responsibilities; the
promotion of enterprise and the attack on poverty and discrimination." This,
said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harris</ENAMEX>, is "synthesis as ideology," by which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blair</ENAMEX> "reserves to himself
the right to change his policies as circumstances change ... not merely as a
matter of expediency, but as a matter of principle." <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blair</ENAMEX>'s term for this
approach to politics is "permanent revisionism." The tabloid Express on
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX>, meanwhile, led with the headline "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blair Rebuke for Clinton</ENAMEX>," based on
the fact that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> is publishing a document on family values
at the same time the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> are meeting in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>.

            In an
editorial <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX> titled "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blair</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>," the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times of London</ENAMEX> said
that while <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blair</ENAMEX> should refrain from offering any more endorsements of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinton</ENAMEX>
"beyond that which would be considered appropriate by most <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>," he is
"completely right to conduct business as usual" with him.

            In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>, the daily <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mainichi Shimbun</ENAMEX>
looked forward in an editorial to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> summit meeting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> between <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prime Minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keizo Obuchi</ENAMEX>. "With the global economy showing signs of
coming apart at the seams, it is truly disappointing that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> of the
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> who ought to be co-operating to prevent a worldwide crisis are
having to struggle for their own political lives," it said. It added, "Signs of
weakness will not be overlooked by the market, which exploits every little
blunder to its advantage."

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Sunday Telegraph</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> led
its front page with an exclusive interview with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sami Salih</ENAMEX>, a defector from
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> who described how he ran <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX>'s illegal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> smuggling network
and how the profits were used to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX>. Now living secretly in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Belgium</ENAMEX> with
his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salih</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> smuggling involved close cooperation between
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX>, even though they were officially enemies. He also painted a
chilling picture of corruption and depravity in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baghdad</ENAMEX> and claimed to have
evidence that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX> recently seduced the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> of his latest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samira Shabandar</ENAMEX>.

            In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kong</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South China</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morning Post</ENAMEX> reported government plans to give <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> as young as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> new
"nursery rhymes," containing warnings about sex <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">offenders</ENAMEX> who might abuse them.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hindu</ENAMEX> devoted an editorial <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX> to the TV coverage of the
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">106</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">th</ENAMEX> birthday celebrations of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> twin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sisters</ENAMEX>, who, it
said, are doing well and enjoying themselves "despite their bent backs and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">wizened</ENAMEX> faces." It commented, "They have [been] featured in the media several
times in the recent past, and do not seem to be any the worse for it, unlike
some other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>."
