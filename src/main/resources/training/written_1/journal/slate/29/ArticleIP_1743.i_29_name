            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Viagra</ENAMEX> is now a household
word everywhere. This was proved <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Delhi</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asian Age</ENAMEX>, which carried a
cartoon showing a sick-looking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fellow</ENAMEX> identified as the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> "coalition
government" being addressed by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> holding a phallic, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rocketlike</ENAMEX> object
labeled "nuclear test." The caption: "This will definitely cure your ailment.
It's made with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Viagra</ENAMEX>." On this, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two days</TIMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> underground
nuclear tests, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asian</ENAMEX> 
               Age joined the rest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> press
in praising the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> for carrying out the tests and urging the rest of
the world to "welcome <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>, not isolate it." It said no one had ever doubted
that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> were both de facto nuclear powers and that "the
simplest answer would be for both to emerge from a rather inadequate <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">closet</ENAMEX> and
then sign the nuclear proliferation treaty."

            In an
editorial
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the following day</TIMEX>, after <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> had carried out <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> further nuclear tests, the
paper was rather less upbeat. It urged the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> to cut down drastically
on spending and to devise an economic policy "attractive enough for foreign
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> to continue patronising <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>." It pointed out that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>, not the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX>, is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>'s largest trade <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partner</ENAMEX>, that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> had "categorically
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">counselled</ENAMEX>" <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Delhi</ENAMEX> about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six weeks ago</TIMEX> not to proceed with the tests and
would now "take measures which correspond" with its outrage. "It is here that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indian</ENAMEX> diplomacy faces its severest test, because unless there is a concrete
action plan to tackle the political and economic fallout of the tests, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> will be faced with a real crisis."

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times of India</ENAMEX> said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX>, and German
sanctions against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> were "hardly going to cause sleeplessness in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Delhi</ENAMEX>," but it also urged the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> to "adopt a more welcoming
stance towards foreign capital than it has so far." The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX> attacked "the
hypocrisy which governs <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> policy on nuclear matters" and said "no <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> has
the right to dictate to another what policies it can and cannot follow."
Therefore, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> move "needs to be condemned in the strongest possible
terms."

            Another
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indian</ENAMEX> paper, the Deccan
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chronicle</ENAMEX>, said it is in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>'s interest that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> also join the
nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">club</ENAMEX>. "If the theory is correct that a credible nuclear deterrent makes
war unnecessary, if not impossible, then another war between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>
will automatically be unnecessary if both acquire nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapon</ENAMEX> capability."
The same paper quoted a minor <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minister</ENAMEX>--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bandaru Dattatreya</ENAMEX>,
union <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minister</ENAMEX> of state for urban development--as stating at a press conference
after the tests that a war would bring unity to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>. "We need not have to be
afraid of wars," he said. "If there is a war, we have to fight." Asked by a
surprised <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> if he really meant what he said, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minister</ENAMEX> replied, "Yes,
I mean it. ... I am on record."

            
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pakistani</ENAMEX> newspaper <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Dawn</ENAMEX> counseled prudence and
said it was
reassuring that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>'s nuclear tests had "failed to push <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> into some
sort of knee-jerk reaction." But it added <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> must "undertake a
wide-ranging review of its foreign policy, economic planning and defence and
security strategy" if it is to be "adequately prepared to meet the critical
situation which <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>'s brazen nuclear ambitions have created in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Asia</ENAMEX>."
In an op-ed piece, <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Dawn</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commentator Sultan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ahmed</ENAMEX> said that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>'s
aims mirror <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> strategy during the arms <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">race</ENAMEX> with the former <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Soviet Union</ENAMEX>--to
bring about the economic collapse of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enemy</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>'s spending on defense
is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6 percent</NUMEX> of the gross national product, while <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>'s is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 3.3 percent</NUMEX>,
he said; but <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>'s armed forces were double the size of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>'s.
"<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ultimately</ENAMEX>, a strong defence needs a strong economy," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ahmed</ENAMEX> added. "<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>'s
military spending is one <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">per cent</NUMEX> of the GNP but that is equal to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">35 billion</NUMEX>
dollars or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> times what <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> spends on defence."

            In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>, the daily <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mainichi Shimbun</ENAMEX>
condemned <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> in an editorial <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> for "foolish actions, which go against the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">universal</ENAMEX> desire to wipe such <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX> of mass destruction from the face of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Earth</ENAMEX>." But it also attacked the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> "for excluding certain tests
that do not involve the detonation of nuclear devices" from the provisions of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty</ENAMEX>. It went on to point out that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Senate</ENAMEX>
has yet to ratify the treaty:

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> is the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">world</ENAMEX>'s largest nuclear power, and its failure to take nuclear disarmament
seriously provides encouragement to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>. We must insist that
the nuclear powers meet their disarmament responsibilities in order to prevent
other <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Indias</ENAMEX> from emerging in the future.

            In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australia</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Age</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Melbourne</ENAMEX> said the tests
made "everyone on this planet feel less safe" and that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>'s "flaunting of
its nuclear credentials comes down to nothing more reputable than a desire for
national prestige."

            In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South China Morning Post</ENAMEX>, under the
headline "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Policy Blown Wide Open</ENAMEX>," ran an opinion piece by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simon Beck</ENAMEX>
saying the tests have "driven a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">truck</ENAMEX> through what <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> believed to be
its well-conceived <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Asia</ENAMEX> policy." It said that cancellation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">President</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s planned visit to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this fall</TIMEX> would be disastrous and only
intensify nationalist fervor in that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. "Instead of feigning horror over
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</TIMEX>'s developments, the time is ripe for Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> to accept the
realities of another major <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">club</ENAMEX>, and use his visit to
make sure its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> knows that its future lies in forging closer ties to
the democratic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">West</ENAMEX>," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beck</ENAMEX> concluded.

            In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>, where the
government has refused to impose sanctions on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> said that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">President</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> needed <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> support and "should have it."
