with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacques Chirac</ENAMEX>'s warning to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX> that time is running
out for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX>, and beneath this headline ran a front-page cartoon of the angel
of death, statement in hand, approaching a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lectern</ENAMEX> bearing the seal of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Le Monde</ENAMEX> also devoted a whole page to an
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">article</ENAMEX> titled "The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinton Haters' Club</ENAMEX>" about a group of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">right-wingers</ENAMEX>--including <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Grover Norquist Jr.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arianna Huffington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R.</ENAMEX> Emmett
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tyrrell Jr.</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ambrose Evans-Pritchard</ENAMEX>, "one of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heroes</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> haters"--who met once a week for dinner in a private room
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Brasserie</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">D.C.</ENAMEX>, to "plot" against the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>.

            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Le Monde</ENAMEX> ,
in its main headline, portrayed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> of the last battle to stop
a war against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> and reprinted in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> translation <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Clancy</ENAMEX>'s
anti-bombing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> article on its front page. In a front-page
column in the conservative Le <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Figaro</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Lambroschini</ENAMEX> commended the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> government
for inventing the concept of "white glove inspections" as a face-saver for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam</ENAMEX> and said that, despite the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX>'s criticism of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">President</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> should be pleased about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>'s independent line, because "he can
longer hide his own doubts about the effectiveness of a bombing campaign."

            While
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> couldn't be sure of destroying <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam</ENAMEX>'s "diabolic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">arsenal</ENAMEX>,"
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lambroschini</ENAMEX> said, he could be "virtually certain of unleashing a wave of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">anti-American</ENAMEX> and pro-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Islamic</ENAMEX> feeling in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Middle East</ENAMEX>." The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Irish Times</ENAMEX> led <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX>
with an interview with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreign minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Qian Qichen</ENAMEX>, who said
that war "must not be waged" against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> and left open the possibility that
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> might use its veto power on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.N. Security Council</ENAMEX> to oppose a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
attack.

            The conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daily Telegraph of London</ENAMEX>
extracted an admission <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> that until <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">last</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>, it had permitted the export to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> of materials used in the production
of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">anthrax</ENAMEX>. In an editorial, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Telegraph</ENAMEX> described <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> indecision
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about</TIMEX> whether to grant an entry visa to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sinn Fein</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gerry Adams</ENAMEX> as
"obscene," said that the questions about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ireland</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">legislators</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prime Minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tony Blair</ENAMEX> during his recent visit to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> were
"of the kind that ought to be reserved for a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> accounting for
his <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>'s treatment of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Kurds</ENAMEX>--not for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>'s closest democratic
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ally</ENAMEX>," and urged the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> to embark on a serious propaganda war
that would defeat "the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX> ... on the battlefield of ideas, as well as
in the back <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Belfast</ENAMEX>." The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Irish Independent</ENAMEX> led on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ulster</ENAMEX> peace
talks and former <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Mitchell</ENAMEX>, who warned of fresh
violence but continued to insist that a peace agreement "can be done and
will be done" by the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 1</TIMEX> deadline.

            In an
interview with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Corriere della Sera</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Milan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Air Force</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Horner</ENAMEX>,
who commanded the air offensive in the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Gulf War</ENAMEX>, said that if <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s aim was
to destroy the sites <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> had declared off-limits to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.N.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inspectors</ENAMEX>, "we have
failed before even beginning, since nobody knows where they are." Attempting to
kill <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam</ENAMEX> would also be "ridiculous," he said, for it would mean bombing
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baghdad</ENAMEX> and killing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of innocent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> when "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam</ENAMEX>'s skin isn't
worth a single <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Iraqi</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX>, or allied life." Asked what advice he would
give <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Horner</ENAMEX> replied, "Don't send your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> to die and to kill for
something you don't fully understand." <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Repubblica of Rome</ENAMEX> reported <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pope</ENAMEX> said
he would go to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baghdad</ENAMEX>, but not before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year 2000</TIMEX>.

            
On its editorial page, Le Monde
published an analysis of the situation in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX>, holding out little hope of a
real rapprochement between the West and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> following its reaffirmation of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fatwa</ENAMEX> against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salman Rushdie</ENAMEX> and the death sentence passed recently on a
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> for having sexual relations with a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Le Monde</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> carried a front-page report that the traffic lights in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bogota</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colombia</ENAMEX>, one of the world's most violent and disorderly <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>, were now being
switched off during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the night</TIMEX> to reduce the number of accidents caused by
motorists crashing into them. Most <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX> published
multipage eulogies of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ernst Juenger</ENAMEX> (a <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War I</ENAMEX> veteran
who celebrated the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Prussian</ENAMEX> military and attacked democracy in his early novels
but went on to oppose <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hitler</ENAMEX>), who died <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</TIMEX> at the age of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">102</NUMEX>. In
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>, the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekly</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Scientist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> reported that a study showing
that cannabis is safer than <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tobacco</ENAMEX> had been suppressed by the World
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Health Organization</ENAMEX> under pressure from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisers</ENAMEX> from
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.N. Drug Control Program</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Le Figaro</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> reported <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> that
drinking <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two or three</NUMEX> glasses of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> a day has been proved to cut the risk of
death from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 percent</NUMEX> among <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Alsatian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>.

            On its front page the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Age of India</ENAMEX> reported that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> election campaign had set
new standards of vulgar and abusive language. For example, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shiv Sena</ENAMEX> party
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bal Thackeray</ENAMEX>, told an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponent</ENAMEX> to "get circumcised" if he had so much
empathy with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslims</ENAMEX>, and informed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress Party</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> that their dependence
on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sonia Gandhi</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">widow</ENAMEX> of onetime <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prime Minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rajiv Gandhi</ENAMEX>) showed they were
"impotent." Even a former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minister</ENAMEX> of parliamentary affairs, whose job had been
to uphold standards of parliamentary behavior, stated publicly that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sonia</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gandhi</ENAMEX>'s political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponents</ENAMEX> were "shit scared" of her, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asian Age</ENAMEX>
said.
