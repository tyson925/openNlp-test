Wrap-Up
               

               In lieu of the usual wrap-up, here's a little more
from "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">In the Line of Duty: true life</ENAMEX> experiences from our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX>," a
supplement to the catalog of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gall's Inc.</ENAMEX>, "<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>'s largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">supplier</ENAMEX> to public
safety <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX>." It's an excerpt from a story by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Webb</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">M.D.</ENAMEX>, of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Munson Urgent Care Clinic</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Traverse City</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mich.</ENAMEX>

               "Surprise! No bullet in the pelvis! An abdominal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">film</ENAMEX> also failed to turn up the elusive <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missile</ENAMEX>. Where could it be? There was
nothing that could be construed as even a fragment of a bullet. Certainly,
nothing was evident over the pubic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone</ENAMEX>. Nor was the bone fractured. Bullets
don't just vaporize!

               "While pondering this, his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> remembered that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">paramedics</ENAMEX> had a lot of difficulty getting his zipper down. She looked at his
pants more closely, noting that the zipper was deformed. Behind the zipper and
in front of the protective cloth <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> overlying the zipper, she found the
spent bullet."

               It's <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Humor in Uniform</ENAMEX>

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antibiotics</ENAMEX> and discharged with follow-up instructions and pain medication."
Happy ending.
