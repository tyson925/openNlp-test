               The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Rapist</ENAMEX> in the
Machine
            

            Revered <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">anti-Communist Arthur Koestler</ENAMEX> repeatedly abused <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> and committed at least
one rape, alleges a new <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> biography serialized in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daily</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Telegraph</ENAMEX> . The book, by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southampton University</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Professor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Cesarani</ENAMEX>,
claims that in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1951</TIMEX> Koestler violently assaulted <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jill Craigie</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> of
former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Labor Party</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Foot</ENAMEX>. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Craigie</ENAMEX> has since confirmed the
story.) The furor over the book led to the removal of a bust of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Koestler</ENAMEX> from
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Edinburgh University</ENAMEX>. Oblivious to the truism that all publicity is good,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cesarini</ENAMEX> wrote in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times Higher Education Supplement</ENAMEX> that his work
was distorted by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Telegraph</ENAMEX> 's sensationalistic presentation. His
stated intent: to balance a candid assessment of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Koestler</ENAMEX>'s unsavory personal
life with a respectful consideration of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>'s achievements as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> and
political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">thinker</ENAMEX>.

            A book debunking
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rigoberta Mench√∫</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">winner</ENAMEX> of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Nobel Peace Prize</ENAMEX>,
has reignited the domestic culture wars. <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Rigoberta Mench√∫ and the Story of</ENAMEX>
All <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Poor Guatemalans</ENAMEX> , by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Middlebury College</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">anthropologist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Stoll</ENAMEX>,
documents numerous inaccuracies, fabrications, and shadings of the truth in
Meneh√∫'s ghostwritten <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</TIMEX> autobiography. Conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commentator</ENAMEX> Dinesh
D'Souza , who first ridiculed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mench√</ENAMEX>∫'s book in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX>, compared the lefty
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">saint</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tawana Brawley</ENAMEX> in a recent op-ed, aligning her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defenders</ENAMEX> with those
who claimed that the truth of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brawley</ENAMEX>'s allegations didn't matter. On the left,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander Cockburn</ENAMEX> declared that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mench√∫</ENAMEX> "survives [<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stoll</ENAMEX>'s] scrutiny," arguing
that his revelations are trivial and that the flaws in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mench√</ENAMEX>∫'s account of her
life are transcended by her success in
bringing world attention to the plight of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guatemalan Indians</ENAMEX>.
Meanwhile, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stoll</ENAMEX>'s book has accelerated debate among anthropologists and
literary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX> over the reliability of individual testimony and the proper
relationship between autobiographical narrative and literal truth.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward</ENAMEX>

            Intellectual celebrity
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward Said</ENAMEX> has assumed the presidency of academia's largest and most
controversial professional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Modern Language Association</ENAMEX> . The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia University</ENAMEX>
literary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholar</ENAMEX>, music <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critic</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Palestinian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activist</ENAMEX> is the best-known
figure to represent the profession in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nation</ENAMEX> hailed his
inauguration as a victory for the left, a sentiment not shared by some inside
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">academy</ENAMEX>, who have noted <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Said</ENAMEX>'s increasingly critical views about the
radical postcolonial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX> who have followed in his footsteps. Meanwhile,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> apologized for the mysterious appearance of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bart</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Simpson</ENAMEX> mask in a photograph of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Palestinian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">demonstrators</ENAMEX> that accompanied an
essay by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Said</ENAMEX> in its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX>.

            
               Retroaffirmative

            <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>'s new
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrat</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gray Davis</ENAMEX>, has endorsed a diversity plan for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University</ENAMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> system that would replace the programs swept away by a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>
ballot initiative. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Officials</ENAMEX> worried about falling minority enrollments and
applications are proposing to guarantee admission to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> to any <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> high-school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> who graduates in the top <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>
percent of his high-school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX>. The 
                  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chronicle of Higher</ENAMEX>
Education
                reports that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ward Connerly</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX> of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>
initiative, has extended cautious support to the plan. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Connerly</ENAMEX> and his allies
scored a recent victory in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, which has begun to dismantle its
affirmative action programs after <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> passed a clone of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>
initiative in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November</TIMEX>.

            
               God Is an
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Environmentalist</ENAMEX>
            

            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last October</TIMEX>, more than
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,000</NUMEX> religious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> from various faiths gathered with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard</ENAMEX>
University for a conference on environmentalism . The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los Angeles Times</ENAMEX>
described the conference as the most visible manifestation of a rapprochement
between religion and environmentalism. Religious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX>, especially
conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christians</ENAMEX>, have long been suspicious of environmentalism, seeing
links between its exaltation of nature and pagan traditions. And
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">environmentalists</ENAMEX> have on occasion attacked religion for promoting human
domination over the natural world. "We still espouse a God-given right of human
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">beings</ENAMEX> to use the environment for their benefit," says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barrett Duke</ENAMEX> of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern Baptists</ENAMEX>. "Creation was not provided to us by God to consume it into
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">oblivion</ENAMEX>."

            
               No! Wait! Sociology
Lives!
               
            

            Not long ago, Lingua
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Franca</ENAMEX> (and others) declared that "sociology is dead." Once considered a
model of social scientific method and a source of broad insights into the way
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> live, the discipline had become directionless, intellectually moribund,
and hopelessly overspecialized, with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">departments</ENAMEX> across the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> scaling
back or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">disappearing</ENAMEX> altogether. But now <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prospect</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> magazine
that covers politics and ideas, asserts that "sociology is back." The evidence? A renaissance of
sociological research in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United Kingdom</ENAMEX>, as well as the fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prime</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tony Blair</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intellectual guru</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sociologist</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">London School of</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Economics Dean Anthony Giddens</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prospect</ENAMEX> adds that the best sociological
research is coming from independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">think tanks</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporations</ENAMEX>, not from
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">universities</ENAMEX>.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Serbia Turns Down</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Express</ENAMEX>
            

            Despite <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. State</ENAMEX>
Department intervention, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Serbia</ENAMEX> denied visas to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">delegation</ENAMEX> assigned by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Human Rights Watch</ENAMEX> to
investigate the suppression of academic freedom in that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. Those denied
visas included <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">philosopher</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Rorty</ENAMEX> and several <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Nobel</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">laureates</ENAMEX>, who were
to participate in a conference with independent <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Serbian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intellectuals</ENAMEX>. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Serbian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> also contended that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">delegation</ENAMEX>--which included Lingua
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Franca</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Managing Editor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laura Secor</ENAMEX>, who recently wrote for the magazine
about the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Serb</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>'s crackdown on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">universities</ENAMEX>--was part of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>
plot.

            The 
                  <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Economist</ENAMEX>
               's survey of
rising young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stars</ENAMEX> in the economics profession found that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this decade</TIMEX>'s hot
young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> are the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> it named to the list <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 years ago</TIMEX>. "Where
are the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Krugmans</ENAMEX> of yesteryear?" the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> asked, wondering
why so few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">junior members</ENAMEX> of the field have crossed over into the public
sphere. The answer seems to be that the very youngest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> is doing work
that is too technical and too mathematical to attract much attention or be
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">applied</ENAMEX> to questions of policy.

            
               Class
Struggles
            

            A labor stalemate between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> and its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">graduate students</ENAMEX> continues. Graduate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> working as
teaching <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assistants</ENAMEX> went on strike in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December</TIMEX>, demanding the right to
collective bargaining for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">TAs</ENAMEX> who work for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> school system.
They then acceded to a "cooling off" period, which ended <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Jan. 21</TIMEX> without an
agreement being reached. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>, affiliated with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Auto Workers</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">union</ENAMEX>, have
had some success: The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">California Public Employment Relations Board</ENAMEX> ruled late
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> in favor of their right to organize. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">university</ENAMEX> appealed the
decision, insisting that graduate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>, even if they work as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">instructors</ENAMEX>,
are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> first and foremost. Union <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">organizers</ENAMEX> have not yet said when the
strike might resume.
