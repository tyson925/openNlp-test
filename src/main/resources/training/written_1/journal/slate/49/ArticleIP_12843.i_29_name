<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.N.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aides</ENAMEX>
accused the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> of using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.N.</ENAMEX> weapons <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inspectors</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spy</ENAMEX> against
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> . The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">accusation</ENAMEX> has raised a furor because the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inspectors</ENAMEX> are supposed
to be independent. The conspiracy theory is that the weapons <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inspectors</ENAMEX> were
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spies</ENAMEX>. The counterconspiracy theory is that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.N.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">allies</ENAMEX> are fanning
the conspiracy theory in order to soften or get rid of the inspections. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> admit they supplied spying equipment to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inspectors</ENAMEX> but offer
several alibis: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) We were just helping the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inspectors</ENAMEX> in response to their
request. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) They authorized everything we did. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) We gathered information only
to find out about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX> programs, not to find out how to kill <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hussein</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) At least we were discreet. Other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> put <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spies</ENAMEX> directly on
the weapons inspection <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>) Of course the weapons inspectors spied against
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX>. That's their job. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>) Without <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spies</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.N.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> would be empty.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Foster</ENAMEX>'s safe in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>, when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> claimed they were missing. She says
something around that time, possibly Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s "initials" on the records,
indicated that they belonged to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary Clinton</ENAMEX>. This is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> claim that
puts <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tripp</ENAMEX> at the nexus of all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinton</ENAMEX> scandals. (She also claims she was the
last <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> to see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Foster</ENAMEX> before his alleged suicide, she was pressured to
commit perjury by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monica Lewinsky</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>, and she was the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> to whom
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kathleen Willey</ENAMEX> confided a sexual encounter with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>.) Tripp issued her latest claim in a deposition for the conservative
interest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Judicial Watch</ENAMEX>. Meanwhile, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> reports
that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tripp</ENAMEX> has sent out a fund-raising letter asking for donations to her legal

testimony. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX> is cynically bringing the indictment now to inject the
