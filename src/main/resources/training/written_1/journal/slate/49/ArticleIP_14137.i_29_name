Wrap-Up
            

            Devoted to metaphors of field and stream, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News Quiz</ENAMEX>
won't shoot sitting <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ducks</ENAMEX> in a barrel. Good jokes surprise you, and
what's an unpredictable comment about racism: that it's bad? Perhaps the task
is not to shoot the sitting duck but to sneak up on it, loop a rope around its
<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">webbed feet</NUMEX>, hang it upside down, and hit it with a stick until it bursts
apart, raining toys and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">candy</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> cavorting below--something surprising
yet delightfully violent.

            And what if the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lott</ENAMEX>
pi√±ata dropped <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">grits</ENAMEX>, spit, and tiny <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trailers</ENAMEX>, the artifacts of debased
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern</ENAMEX> culture? Would the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">grits</ENAMEX> be <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ducks</ENAMEX>, or are they fair game for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News Quiz</ENAMEX>
scorn? Fire away, but only if you wrote your reply between acts at the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metropolitan Opera</ENAMEX>, after laying down your edition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plato</ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>. If you
composed your response within eyesight of a TV set or a slice of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pizza</ENAMEX>, it's
time to reconsider your sense of regional superiority and just go fishing.

            

               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alabastard</ENAMEX>--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sorry</ENAMEX>--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alabaster Answer</ENAMEX>
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lott</ENAMEX> gave the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX> keynote speech to the national
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> meeting of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Council of Conservative Citizens</ENAMEX>, the retro-successor to
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Klannish White Citizens Councils</ENAMEX>. Despite frequent appearances at its
meetings and photographs of him smiling with its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lott</ENAMEX> persistently
denies any association with the "pro-white" <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>.

            And after a hard day of lying and racism, then
what?

            "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trent Lott</ENAMEX> likes order, neatness, things in their
place. So he has developed little routines, one of which is this: When he
arrives home from work <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">each evening</TIMEX>, he drops his briefcase, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heads</ENAMEX> upstairs to
his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedroom</ENAMEX>, and changes into his <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">cotton pajamas</ENAMEX>. Then he bounds back down the
steps to have dinner with his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tricia</ENAMEX>," writes a cheerfully nonjudgmental
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kevin Merida</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> . (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Thanks to Kate Wing</ENAMEX>.)

            Or to put it another way,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Capable</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Attractive</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Attorney</ENAMEX> inquires: Why does every black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> who
ever shook hands with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis Farrakhan</ENAMEX> have to apologize, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trent Lott</ENAMEX> is
walking around free? In his pajamas?

            Garment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> and human
rights <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> filed suit <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> against <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>, charging that
their clothing is manufactured in appalling <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saipan</ENAMEX> sweatshops. But apparently
it was all a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">merry mix-up</ENAMEX>, judging by the response of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">companies</ENAMEX>
involved.

            THE <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAP</ENAMEX> "does not tolerate this type of conduct in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factories</ENAMEX> where we do business." I'm convinced.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WAL-MART</ENAMEX> has a "<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>-tolerance position with regard
to illegal or unethical working conditions." Good enough for me.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">J.C. PENNEY</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saipan</ENAMEX> offers a "consistently
reliable source of reasonably priced, high-quality fashion items for their
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">retailer customers</ENAMEX>." I'm sorry I doubted them.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TOMMY HILFIGER</ENAMEX> said,
"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Music</ENAMEX> is my strongest inspiration, and I feel that it encompasses the true
style of fashion. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rolling Stones</ENAMEX> are the greatest rock <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">band</ENAMEX> in the world,
and I cannot think of another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> who have made such an impact on
the world of fashion. Departing from my past ad campaigns, the rock pictorials
portray <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> who are fresh, young, and all-American, in a cutting edge, high
energy, and modern environment." This may refer to a slightly different aspect
of his operation, but any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mick</ENAMEX>'s ...

            Light, inexpensive, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">contemptible</ENAMEX>, the cell phone inspires stories, sneers, and songs, except for
the songs.

            "Recently in a university
lecture I was giving, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> in the front row got a call on his cell phone,

            "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Standing</ENAMEX> in the wine

department (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 10 yards</NUMEX> away) to check on whether she should buy white or
red. Why have a face to face conversation when you can exist as a disembodied
voice on their remote answering service? The only plus about cell phones is the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> they make their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> look like the rest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX> who shuffle around

            "I am befuddled by those
who think that the public use of a cell phone is a status symbol. Rather, a
cell phone is a device of convenience, clear and simple. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Folks</ENAMEX> who ascribe more

are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than two</NUMEX> cans with an invisible string are those who want others to
see them with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vuitton</ENAMEX> bag on their <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX> as they slide into the buttery
