something else, because it's over as far as I'm concerned." Political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX>

<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> proposed big changes to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> . He proposed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) to

shot down the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>, on the grounds that making the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> a shareholder
in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> would create dangerous conflicts of interest both ways. Other
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">criticisms: 1</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> is using the surplus to avoid proposing benefit cuts,
which will eventually be necessary. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) The stock investment idea is
nationalization in disguise. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Workers</ENAMEX>, not <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">administrators</ENAMEX>,
should get to choose their investments. Pro-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> rebuttals: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Workers</ENAMEX> would
squander their money if they chose the investments. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) By devoting the surplus
to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> is keeping congressional <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX>
