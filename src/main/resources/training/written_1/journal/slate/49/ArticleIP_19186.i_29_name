Wrap-Up
            

            Demonstrations on
television never look right. All the signs are painted the same color, as if
they were done <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the night before</TIMEX>, presumably by that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX> who did the prom
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">decorations for Sabrina</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Teenage Witch</ENAMEX> . If the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">marchers</ENAMEX> are white
college <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>, they look like an issue of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Archie comics</ENAMEX>; if they're
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African-American</ENAMEX> college <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>, they look like they've been costumed by whoever
did <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the first few</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackson</ENAMEX> Five albums. TV demos capture neither the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">exhilaration</ENAMEX> nor the fear, conveying instead the smug fatuity of some
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>-unit <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> who believes social change is for saps; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DGA</ENAMEX> cards are for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">winners</ENAMEX>. And by the way, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Man</ENAMEX> can't bust our music, but it turns out that he
can repackage it as an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC</ENAMEX> mini-series, The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">'60s</TIMEX> . At last, someone has
collected all the turbulent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decade</TIMEX> clich√©s in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one convenient 37 hour</TIMEX> package. I
guess I can finally throw out my <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Moby</ENAMEX> Grape albums.

Answer
            

            A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> dressed as the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Statue of Liberty</ENAMEX> holds a
sign reading "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rudy</ENAMEX>: Keep your wretched <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">tons</NUMEX> of garbage." A man
dressed like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ben Franklin</ENAMEX> holds a clear plastic bag (of garbage?) bearing an "I
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heart NY</ENAMEX>" sign. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> in a ball cap clutches a bundle (garbage? <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">baby</ENAMEX>?) and
holds a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sierra Club</ENAMEX> placard: "Protect our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Kids</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Health and Heritage</ENAMEX>."

            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> from
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Jersey</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maryland</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Virginia</ENAMEX> urged Mayor
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giuliani</ENAMEX> to reconsider his waste policies. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mayor</ENAMEX> has not yet called them
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">idiots</ENAMEX>. But perhaps he's too busy acting surprised that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYPD</ENAMEX> shot another
unarmed black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>.
