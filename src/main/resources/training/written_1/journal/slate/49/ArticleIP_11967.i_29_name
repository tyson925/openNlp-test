            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sydney Morning Herald</ENAMEX>
reports <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX>' plans to extradite former <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indonesian</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Suharto</ENAMEX> and charge him with mass killings in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East Timor</ENAMEX>. Human rights
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> claim that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as many as 200,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Timorese</ENAMEX> have been killed since <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indonesia</ENAMEX>
invaded and annexed the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1976</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Nations</ENAMEX> still
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">recognizes Portugal</ENAMEX> as the area's administrative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authority</ENAMEX>, and the lawyers
behind the move say it was inspired by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>'s attempts to try former <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chilean</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dictator</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Augusto Pinochet</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Suharto</ENAMEX> case has better legal standing, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Herald</ENAMEX> points out, because "the crimes he is accused of were committed
on territory still recognised by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UN</ENAMEX> and international law as being
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Portuguese</ENAMEX>."

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pinochet specter</ENAMEX> is
also raised in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hong Kong Standard</ENAMEX> , which questions the possibility that
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cambodian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hun Sen</ENAMEX> might grant amnesty to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> prominent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Khmer Rouge</ENAMEX>: "Why should these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">killers</ENAMEX> be let off?" The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> reports that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hun</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sen</ENAMEX> promised the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Nations</ENAMEX> that he would help apprehend <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Khmer Rouge</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> and bring them before an international <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tribunal</ENAMEX> for crimes against
humanity. "Can Mr <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hun Sen</ENAMEX> now justifiably refuse to hand them over to an
international <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tribunal</ENAMEX>, particularly at a time when war <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">criminals</ENAMEX> from the
former <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yugoslavia</ENAMEX> have been indicted and former <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chilean</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dictator</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Augusto</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pinochet</ENAMEX> is under siege<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">?</ENAMEX>"

            Pessimism pervades <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX>' seasonal stories around the
world. Under the headline "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Not a Merry Christmas For Everyone</ENAMEX>," the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moscow Times</ENAMEX> , while
recognizing that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> were better off than the rest of
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX>, writes that "even here in the showpiece of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> society, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tens of</NUMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have lost their savings in the collapse of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>'s
banking system. Still more have become unemployed or had their salaries slashed
as the banking, media and consumer-goods <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX> have switched from boom to
bust." Meanwhile, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sunday Times</ENAMEX> names the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cuban</ENAMEX> trade union <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">weekly</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trabajadores</ENAMEX>
"<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scrooge</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the week</TIMEX>" for its lack of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spirit</ENAMEX>. After a hiatus of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas Day</TIMEX> was restored as a public holiday in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX>, but
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trabajadores</ENAMEX> attacked state-run <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> for stocking <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> decorations
and denounced <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Santa Claus</ENAMEX> as "the leading <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">symbol</ENAMEX> of the hagiography of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mercantilism</ENAMEX>."

            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a season</TIMEX> when
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> can only be envious of their overseas <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterparts</ENAMEX>' more generous
vacation packages, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Age</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Melbourne</ENAMEX> reveals that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Australians</ENAMEX> "have lost the will or can't find the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> to take that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> break." The decline can be explained in part by workers
trying to keep up with their <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterparts</ENAMEX> in an increasingly global
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">economy</ENAMEX>. "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX> leave provisions (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20 days</TIMEX> in total) are among the lowest in
the world--slightly more than <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cambodia</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">16</NUMEX>), slightly less than <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25 days</TIMEX>)
and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Singapore</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26 days</TIMEX>) and substantially less than the world's best holiday
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">practitioners</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sweden</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX> (a whopping <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38 days</TIMEX> each)."

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Statesman of Calcutta</ENAMEX> announces that "[t]ourist traffic in
Jaisalmer, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Rajasthan</ENAMEX> desert <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">district</ENAMEX> where nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX> were tested this
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>, decreased alarmingly, apparently due to the alleged <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Western</ENAMEX> propaganda
against the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pokhran</ENAMEX> nuclear tests." According to the paper, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>'s first
nuclear test in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1974</TIMEX> gave the area a tourism boost. "This time, though, things
are different."

            A comment in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Independent</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> deflates <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">entrepreneur</ENAMEX> and balloonist
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Branson</ENAMEX>. The paper challenges <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Branson</ENAMEX>'s spin that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">balloon</ENAMEX>, piloted
by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Branson</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Fossett</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Per Lindstrand</ENAMEX>, had ditched in "<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">shark</ENAMEX>-infested
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX>." "There are, needless to say, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sharks</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific Ocean</ENAMEX> but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oahu</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Honolulu</ENAMEX>, is about as savage a place as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Weybridge</ENAMEX> [a
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> seaside <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX>]. There are coral reefs off the island which are dying
because the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> on holiday there urinate in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> so much
that, at peak flow, the ocean surrounding the reefs becomes toxic. That wasn't
mentioned in the reports. 'Branson ditches into urine-rich ocean' doesn't sound
quite as good, does it?"

            <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">daily</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asahi</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shimbun</ENAMEX> declares that "[<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g</ENAMEX>]loom and despondency sum up <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>, according to
the kanji chosen by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> to symbolize <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> now drawing to an end. In
an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> poll ... the kanji for 'doku' (poison) was the overwhelming
favorite." Apparently, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX>'s "curry-poisoning sensation," when someone
added <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">arsenic</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> that was served at a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">festival</ENAMEX>, and media stories
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about</NUMEX> dioxin poisoning and environmental hazards account for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">doku</TIMEX> 's
popularity. Previous <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>' kanji have not been much cheerier: In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>
"earthquake" took the honors; in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> a mass food poisoning scandal led to the
victory of "food"; and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX> was represented by "bankruptcy."

            In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>, where betting
is legal, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sunday Times</ENAMEX> lists some of the "unusual bets for the next
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>" accepted by a leading bookmaker. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Hill</ENAMEX> has offered odds of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10-to-1</NUMEX>
that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary Clinton</ENAMEX> would announce divorce proceedings during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>,
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20-to-1</NUMEX> that the controversial "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Millennium Dome</ENAMEX>" would be scrapped, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100-to-1</NUMEX>
that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prince Charles</ENAMEX> would marry his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sons</ENAMEX>' former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nanny</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tiggy Legge-Bourke</ENAMEX>, and
<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 million-to-1</NUMEX> that the world would end in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August</TIMEX>.
