            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> may have been in crisis <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all year</TIMEX>,
but the events were less the stuff of great drama than of a farcical musical
comedy. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hey</ENAMEX>, wait a minute--let's put on a show!

            
               The time: <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November 1995</TIMEX>.
            

            
               The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX>, led by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Speaker</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Newt Gingrich</ENAMEX>, are insisting on their version of
the budget. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Clinton</ENAMEX> is stubbornly rejecting it. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX>
have taken a bold option: They will just refuse to pass a budget, and they'll
let the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> shut down. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oval Office</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">BILL CLINTON</ENAMEX> meets
with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisers</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">LEON PANETTA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HAROLD ICKES</ENAMEX> and secretary
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BETTY CURRIE</ENAMEX> to discuss this development.

production number)

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">PANETTA</ENAMEX>:
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> have positions

            To which they're clinging
fast.

            
               ICKES: The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> is just as firm

            The die, it seems, is
cast.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">PANETTA</ENAMEX>:
Without a budget passed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> will
close.

            All of the workers

            Will be sent home on
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">furloughs</ENAMEX>.

Also those at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX>

space.

And here at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>

            My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> should remain.

adjustments will be required.

OK, tell the ushers

            To take <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few days</TIMEX> off.

            To go play themselves some
<ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">golf</ENAMEX>.

            We have to do without the

to muddle through.

               [The lights go down.
When they resume, the intern-- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">MONICA LEWINSKY</ENAMEX> --is talking on
the phone to her good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">LINDA TRIPP</ENAMEX> .]
            

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">LEWINSKY</ENAMEX>:
Well, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">y'know</ENAMEX>, I'd seen him around, like, a lot. And I know he noticed me. So
when they said they needed an intern to answer the phones, I said,
"Hel-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">lo</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">o-o</ENAMEX>!" And then I had the idea to take him <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pizza</ENAMEX>!

            

               TRIPP: And then what happened?

            "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">What Went On"</ENAMEX> (upbeat)

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">LEWINSKY</ENAMEX>:
Then I led him on.

            I showed him my thong,

            I let him take a long and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ling'ring</ENAMEX> look.

            I led him on.

            He studied my thong,

            And
from that point I had the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> hooked.

            That <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> when I took the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pizza</ENAMEX>,

            I made sure that he knew
that he could have a piece.

            We went into the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hallway</ENAMEX> by
his study

            And dispensed with
formalities.

            
               TRIPP: Oh
please go on!

            You must go on!

            Spill, spill, spill, spill,
spill!

            Now go on,

            Please go on.

            Did <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> let you say hi
to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Little Bill</ENAMEX>?

His lips and mine locked in a kiss fantastic,

            His hands roved freely
'neath my blouse,

            I reached into the
presidential trousers,

            And he
got a phone call from a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX>.

            So I went on,

            While he talked on the
phone,

            I took a position before
him on my knees,

            And I went on.

            And he talked on.

            Though what the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">congressman</ENAMEX>
heard was

            
"Please, please, please, please, please!"

            But then we didn't go
on!

            
               TRIPP: You
didn't go on?

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">LEWINSKY</ENAMEX>:
No, he stopped me when he seemed upon the cusp.

            
               TRIPP: So
you didn't go on?

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">LEWINSKY</ENAMEX>:
No, we didn't go on.

            He said he wasn't sure if I
was someone he

            Could

            Trust.

Trust?

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">LEWINSKY</ENAMEX>:
That's why we didn't go on.

            
               TRIPP:
That's so weird! What did he think? That you'd go blabbin' this to the whole
world?
