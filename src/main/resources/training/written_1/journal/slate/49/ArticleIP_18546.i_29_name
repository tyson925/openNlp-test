            As <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the new year</TIMEX> turns, amid
the journalistic farrago of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year end</TIMEX> summaries and photo spreads, with world
crises recapped, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">celebrities remourned</ENAMEX>, and cartoons reprinted, I always look
forward to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> issue of the 
                  Wine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spectator</ENAMEX>
               . This issue contains the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX>'s
updated "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Vintage Chart</ENAMEX>," the key to ordering well at a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX>.

            I quickly put the chart
into my wallet and toss out <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX>'s out-of-date one. The size of a large
business card, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wine Spectator</ENAMEX> vintage chart unfolds like an
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accordion</ENAMEX>. Its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> pages of data-crammed grids include lists of the major wine
regions of the world and scores (on a scale of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>) for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each year</TIMEX> with a
note to "drink or hold" (in other words, enjoy it now or bank it and let it
appreciate).

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wine Spectator</ENAMEX> chart is the best of its kind,
mainly because it is the most comprehensive. Even a wine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX> who tracks
these things might not remember, as he scans a wine list, what conditions were
like for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> Alsatian <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wines</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>. (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Good</ENAMEX>: The cheat sheet hands out a high
"<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">92</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Drink/Hold</ENAMEX>." ) Or whether to order that underpriced <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Barolo 1994</TIMEX>? (No: The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Piedmont</ENAMEX> region in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX> gets a lousy <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">77</NUMEX>.) Taillevent, a superb <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX>, supplies its own chart for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patrons</ENAMEX>, and even includes a line on tiny
Jura, a region on the border between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Switzerland</ENAMEX>. Even if you don't
know what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Juran√</ENAMEX>ßon is, go ahead and order it if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX>'s chart has it
in its very best year of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the decade</TIMEX>. (Actually, be careful because some
Juran√ßon is <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dessert wine</ENAMEX>.)

            Vintage charts are a
great idea because they isolate the most important variable in the making of
wine: <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX>. The best way to find a good, underpriced <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> is to look for a
type of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> you like (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bordeaux</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">cabernet</ENAMEX>, pinot noir) in an
excellent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> (click here for an annotated list of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">grapes</ENAMEX> and varieties).
Even if you have never heard of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">producer</ENAMEX>, the chances are it's pretty good.
In general, prices follow name brands not <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, so you will find bargains as
well. And if the winemaker is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> decent, in a great <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> he will have done
well. So a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bordeaux</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Burgundy</ENAMEX> is likely to be first-rate if made by a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">respectable</ENAMEX>, even if unknown, winemaker. Similarly, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX> was a balmy year for
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cabs</ENAMEX>: You simply can't go wrong if you order one or even purchase it
in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop</ENAMEX> that stocks selectively. (Note re buying <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>: You're
also relying on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX>'s screening system. There are truly awful
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">winemakers</ENAMEX> who could make plonk even in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the best year</TIMEX>. But few <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>
carry such <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wines</ENAMEX>.)

            Obviously, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> isn't the only determinant. The region, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">grape</ENAMEX> variety, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">winemaker</ENAMEX>'s skill have an enormous effect on wine
quality. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> tend to talk lyrically about the terroir , the
characteristics given by particular climate and soil, while <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> worship
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">winemakers</ENAMEX> instead, turning them into <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">celebrities</ENAMEX>. But by concentrating on
nature rather than nurture, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> are probably closer to the truth than
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> are. At <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the day</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> is an agricultural product. Just
as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> to year quality of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oranges</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">potatoes</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tomatoes</ENAMEX> is determined
primarily by the weather, so it is with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">grapes</ENAMEX>.

            The comparison isn't
perfect because <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> is not simply an agricultural product. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Grapes</ENAMEX> must be
pressed, fermented, blended, and aged to make <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX>, so it's better described as
a semi-processed food product--one whose quality is shaped as it sits and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">decays</ENAMEX> in vats, barrels, and bottles. I say semi-processed because <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> is not
the mass-produced, machine-made, processed food that orange juice is, so the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">winemaker</ENAMEX> cannot interfere as much with the process. Consequently, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a bad year</TIMEX>,
with some exceptions, means bad <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX>, whether at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ch√¢teau</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Lafite-Rothschild</ENAMEX> or
at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gallo</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cabernet sauvignon</ENAMEX> in a bad, that is, excessively cold, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> tastes
acidic, weedy, and vegetal. Pinot noir simply tastes thin and fruitless.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Chardonnay</ENAMEX> is a hardy <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">grape</ENAMEX>, which is why it is so widely produced all over the
world. You're unlikely to get something really "off" when you order a glass of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Chardonnay</ENAMEX>, which explains its ubiquity on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> lists.

            Of course you can compensate for weather--within limits.
Just as in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a good year</TIMEX> you can do well easily, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a bad year</TIMEX> almost nothing can
make a first-rate product. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Winemakers</ENAMEX> who make fine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">champagne</ENAMEX>, special <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Napa</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">cabernets</ENAMEX>, and single-vineyard burgundies do not make their best <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wines</ENAMEX>--say
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stag's Leap</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cask 23</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vintage Bollinger</ENAMEX>--in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a bad year</TIMEX>. At the great <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sauternes</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">vineyard Ch√¢teau d'Yquem</ENAMEX> they make none of their legendary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> if the weather
has been particularly bad--a crippling financial decision, less and less likely
to be made as the old standards of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">owner</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Comte de Lurs-Saluces</ENAMEX>, are
replaced by those of management gnomes.

            What makes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a good year</TIMEX> is a very complicated matter,
since different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">grapes</ENAMEX> and regions are best served by different weather
conditions. In general the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX> should form in good-sized bunches on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">vine</ENAMEX>,
ripen at a reasonable pace, and be plucked when fully ripe. The great enemies
of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">grape</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">growers</ENAMEX> are extremes and sudden change--fluctuating temperatures,
sudden rainstorms, heat waves, flash frosts. (In fact, even the banalities I've
just written are actually the subject of intense controversy.) It's a complex
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">grid</ENAMEX>, too complicated for the average imbiber to chart for himself, which is
why you should celebrate <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every new year</TIMEX> with a nice bottle and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wine</ENAMEX>
Spectator cheat sheet.
