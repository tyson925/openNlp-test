            By way of introducing our
subject--providing for the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">material</ENAMEX> needs of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX>--a caveat: Whatever it is,
you don't need it.

            In other words, do as I
say, not as I've done. It is permissible, I believe, to shop like a mad <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> for
your <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> and, when <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Daughter No. 1</ENAMEX> arrived <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nearly two years ago</TIMEX>, I did.
But when my auxiliary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> appeared on the scene <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last month</TIMEX>, I learned not
one lesson from the mistakes of previous rampages.

            A sort of shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">psychosis</ENAMEX> overtakes the mind of a father
fresh from the delivery <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>. It might be rooted in some sort of primal
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hunter</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">gatherer</NUMEX>-type urge, the kind that afflicts most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> when they enter a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Price Club</ENAMEX> ("Of course we need <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">24 gallons</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">WD-40</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">honey</ENAMEX>. You never know when
they're going to stop making it"). Conquer this urge, and you may graduate the
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">month</TIMEX> of parenthood without fielding a call from an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Express</ENAMEX>
security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> worried about "unusual activity" on your card.

            Here, then, a quick guide
to what you need and what you don't. This is, obviously, a subjective guide
written by the kind of flawed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> who actually considered buying an
electric baby wipe warmer. It is also the briefest of guides--each subcategory
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX> products is worthy of book-length discussion. Finally, it is
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">utilitarian</ENAMEX>: If you are the sort of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> who must have a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kate Spade</ENAMEX> diaper
bag knowing full well that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kate Spade</ENAMEX> diaper bag is a waste of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$250</NUMEX>, I can't
help you.

            D iapers: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diaper</ENAMEX> bags are a good place to
start, since they are unnecessary: A <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$20 knapsack</NUMEX> and a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2</NUMEX> dry-down--an
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">absorbent</ENAMEX>, washable pad--are perfectly sufficient substitutes. Diapers are,
however, necessary, and I would suggest as a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step the purchase of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Price</ENAMEX>
Club diapers, which come in huge cartons and cost <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 25 percent</NUMEX> less than
the equivalent number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pampers</ENAMEX>. Warehouse club diapers aren't as handsome or
sturdy-looking as "premium" or "supreme" diapers, but even standard diapers
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> can absorb the contents of a camel's hump without leaking. Avoid
"premium" diapers that contain emollients or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aloe vera</ENAMEX>, which don't transfer to
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX>'s skin. The only diaper worth paying a premium price for is one that
changes itself.

            There is no downside (this pun was genuinely
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unintended</ENAMEX>) to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Price Club</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby wipes</ENAMEX>, whose very inferiority make them a better
product. Most premium brands--<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Huggies</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pampers</ENAMEX>, and the like--are soaked to an
absurd degree with whatever strange chemical cleansers all wipes are soaked in.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Price Club</ENAMEX> wipes, however, are packaged with more modest amounts of cleansing
liquid, presumably to save the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX> money. Which is fine, because wipes
that are too wet must then be followed up with several dry-cloth swipes, which
can irritate the skin. As for electric baby wipe warmers, one of which, in my
local high-end <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby superstore</ENAMEX> Buy Buy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baby</ENAMEX> (awful names are a hazard of this
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trade</ENAMEX>) sold for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$24.99</NUMEX>, I have this to say: As much as I want my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> to be
sheltered from the cruelties of life on earth, I think they should get used to
the fact that sometimes their asses will get <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cold</ENAMEX>.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> more note, as we
leave the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">diaper department</ENAMEX>: An indispensable purchase is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diaper Genie</ENAMEX>, a
brilliant little contraption that is a vast improvement over the open diaper
pail. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diaper Genie</ENAMEX> (which generally sells for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">around $25</NUMEX>) accepts dirty
diapers through a hole on top, and with a few twists of a canister, seals the
diapers in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plastic</ENAMEX> and eliminates most of the smell. It does not provide <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Level</ENAMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> biohazard containment--ignore the optimistic "odor-free" claim made on the
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">box</ENAMEX>--but it will do in most cases.

            C lothing: Even if you are only moderately
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">popular</ENAMEX> and come from a modestly sized <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, you will receive, on the birth
of your <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">at least $500</NUMEX> worth of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baby Gap</ENAMEX> clothing. (Which means
that a gift of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gap</ENAMEX> stock, rather than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gap</ENAMEX> clothing, should be far more
welcome.) There are those who decry the style hegemony of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baby Gap</ENAMEX>, but I am
not one of them. The clothing is relatively inexpensive, durable, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">returnable</ENAMEX>. The point is this: There are plenty of places to dump <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$100</NUMEX> on a
pair of awfully cute <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX> overalls that will be worn exactly <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times, but
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$100</NUMEX> baby overalls, like subzero freezers and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Land Rovers</ENAMEX>, are a sign that you
have too much money.

            
               Car safety: On issues of child
safety, I take the SDI position, which is to say, there is no such thing as too
much defense spending. Hence the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Explorer</ENAMEX> parked outside, which I would
upgrade to an Expedition except that I live in a neighborhood filled with
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Naderite</ENAMEX> public interest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> who would firebomb my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> if I drove
anything so offensive.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">tons</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">metal</ENAMEX> are not
enough to defend your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, however. A maximalist position on safety means
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> car seat will do, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Britax</ENAMEX>. It is more expensive than the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">run-of-the-mill Century</ENAMEX> line of car <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">seats</ENAMEX> (a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Britax</ENAMEX> runs <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">above $200</NUMEX>), but it is
made of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">material</ENAMEX> so hard it would crack your knee if you walked into it, and
its belting system is far more encompassing and elaborate than the average car
seat's.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX> ome safety: Every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX> superstore
features a section that could be called the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Wall of Death</ENAMEX>. At Buy Buy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baby</ENAMEX>, the
suburban <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> store with which I'm most familiar, the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Wall of Death</ENAMEX> rises
<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">16 feet</NUMEX> into the air and stretches <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 feet</NUMEX> wide, and every inch of the wall is
covered with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> safety products, some of which are absolutely useless and
most of which I have bought. (I haven't got around to installing the toilet lid
locks yet.) Obviously, outlet <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guards</ENAMEX> and rubber padding for low furniture (the
"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Coffee Tables of Death</ENAMEX>," with which most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> are familiar) are necessary,
but the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Wall of Death</ENAMEX> preys on parental fear. Hence, a product called
"fireplace gas valve safety covers," whose purpose was too obscure for me to
understand, and the VCR <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lock</ENAMEX>, which, according to the packaging, "prevents
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> from inserting objects into cassette opening." Another way to prevent a
deadly epidemic of object insertions is to move the VCR. Incidentally, the best
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> to keep a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> from drowning in the toilet is to keep an eye on the child
or the toilet--excessive reliance on safety <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">products</ENAMEX> tends toward lower
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">vigilance</ENAMEX>.

            Then there are the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby monitors</ENAMEX>, arguably a
necessity if you live in a big <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and can't hear the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX> crying in her
room--and also a necessity if you're interested in intercepting police
transmissions--but is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Child View Monitor</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Television</ENAMEX>, for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$149.99</NUMEX>,
really necessary? You can't even use it to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spy</ENAMEX> on a nanny, since it has no
hidden camera capabilities.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Breast</ENAMEX>

               pumps: Ask someone else.

            C ribs: You can spend <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$500</NUMEX> (or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1,000</NUMEX>) on a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">crib</ENAMEX>, or you can spend <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$200</NUMEX>. Spend <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$200</NUMEX>. All cribs do the same thing, which is
stand there. All cribs sold in reputable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> meet current safety standards,
so no worries in that regard.

            
               Shoes:
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Payless ShoeSource</ENAMEX>, or the equivalent, is the way to go. Actually, barefoot is
the way to go, but in those places where a small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> should wear shoes--such
as needle-strewn <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">playgrounds</ENAMEX>--it is a waste of money to spend <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $10.99</NUMEX>
on a pair of shoes. We bought Daughter No. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 three</NUMEX> pairs of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$35</NUMEX> shoes, which
she outgrew in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a month</TIMEX> and wore so rarely in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that month</TIMEX> that, amortized, the
shoes cost <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$10</NUMEX> per wearing, money that could have been better spent on
fireplace gas valve safety covers.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> oys: An endless subject, one that I'm
hesitant to tackle, and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> aren't old enough for me to comment on
Furby with any authority. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> general observation, though: The wrapping paper
is always more interesting to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX> than whatever's inside, so my gift
suggestion would be a cardboard box wrapped in bright red paper and filled with
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tupperware</ENAMEX> and wooden spoons. That is, if you can stand the noise produced by
wooden spoons hitting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tupperware</ENAMEX>.

            The general subject of toys is a sensitive one in
my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>, because it is on toys that I am a serial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spender</ENAMEX>. An example: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Four</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> after my <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> was born, I was dispatched to Buy Buy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baby</ENAMEX> to
find some sort of bassinet accouterment, worth <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $9.50</NUMEX>. I returned home two
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> later with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$300</NUMEX> worth of toys, including a stuffed, mounted, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">furry rhino</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> that cost <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$89.99</NUMEX>. At the time, I somehow believed that my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughters</ENAMEX> would
grow up healthy and secure if they just had a stuffed, mounted <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rhino</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> in
their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>. I don't know why I believed this.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rhino</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> has since been returned, and I am
banned from toy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> until <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">such time</TIMEX> as I regain my bearings. It was a
foolish purchase, I see now--for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$89.99</NUMEX>, I could have bought <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> electric
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">baby</ENAMEX> wipe warmers. Or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one-third</NUMEX> of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kate Spade</ENAMEX> diaper bag.
