Wrap-Up
            

            It is tempting, when
presented with any list of unattractive qualities--and let's assume copious
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">drooling</ENAMEX> is unattractive--to apply it willy-nilly to our ideological <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foes</ENAMEX>.
Naturally we resist. Not for us the cheap swipes at <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blowhard</ENAMEX> and Rep.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Windbag</ENAMEX>. Not for us the easy recourse to the
our-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX>-are-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all</NUMEX>-corrupt-and-stupid gag--and let's assume they're not. We
know that knee-jerk cynicism is as uninteresting as persistent
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">naivet√©</ENAMEX>--although the former is the superior betting strategy if you're playing
blackjack in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vegas</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Death</ENAMEX>. That aside, the rapier is better than the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bludgeon</ENAMEX>--unless, of course, you are a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">policeman</ENAMEX> hamstrung by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">goody-goody</ENAMEX> regulations made by a bunch of stupid, corrupt, persistently naive
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> who won't let a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> serve and protect. And while we're at it, let's
also admit that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s question drifted into "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Smelly, Lethargic, Incoherent</ENAMEX>"
territory. But aren't you glad it did?

Answer
            

            You are a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> suffering from separation anxiety. You
should take <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clomicalm</ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">anti-depressant</ENAMEX> just approved for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pets</ENAMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Food</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drug Administration</ENAMEX>. Also OK'd, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pfizer</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anipryl</ENAMEX>, for "senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX>"
suffering from mental deterioration. Both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>, under different names, are
already used by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nicholas Dodman</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tufts</ENAMEX>
University <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">veterinarian</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Dog Who Loved Too Much</ENAMEX> ,
noted that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Prozac</ENAMEX> is also an excellent canine treatment, particularly for dogs
with fear of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowds</ENAMEX> or thunderstorms. "You can buy that dog some time," he said
about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anipryl</ENAMEX>, "Buy it an extra year where you would have been at your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wits</ENAMEX>'
end in a sort of latrine situation."

            Which of the following is
meant literally, and which is meant figuratively?

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. "We don't want to be the cheapest meat on the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">block</ENAMEX>."

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pizza</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christie Todd Whitman</ENAMEX>."

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. "My ... home is here on the floor."

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. " 'Snip and dunk' conversions."

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>. "These dwarfs may look
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">insubstantial</ENAMEX>, but they are like cannonballs to a giant galaxy."

just because hog prices have plunged.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. Literally. This was a stop on the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> month

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. Literally. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX>, strict <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Orthodox Jews</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">disdain Reform</ENAMEX> and Conservative conversions as little more than circumcision
for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and immersion in a ritual bath for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Figuratively</ENAMEX> and
literally. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Astronomer John Kormendy</ENAMEX> explains new research showing that some
small galaxies have dark matter densities <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 100</NUMEX> times greater than that of
large galaxies. Dark matter constitutes most of the universe.
