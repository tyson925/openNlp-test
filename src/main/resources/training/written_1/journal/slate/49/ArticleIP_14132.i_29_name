            According to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israeli</ENAMEX>
daily <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ha'aretz</ENAMEX> , there is one <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politician</ENAMEX> who rises in the polls for
no apparent reason. Exposing his lies on television has no effect on his
potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supporters</ENAMEX>, nor even, it appears, on many of his nonsupporters,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ha'aretz</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commentator</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gideon Samet</ENAMEX> wrote. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politician</ENAMEX> in question is <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israeli</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prime Minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Benjamin Netanyahu</ENAMEX>, the
"odds-on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">favorite</ENAMEX> to win the next general election." A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gallup</ENAMEX> poll in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last weekend</TIMEX> gave <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Netanyahu</ENAMEX> a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">56 percent</NUMEX> chance of victory. "The legendary
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phoenix</ENAMEX> that rises from the ashes is nothing compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Netanyahu</ENAMEX>," Samet
said.

            Both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ha'aretz</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yediot Aharanot</ENAMEX> reported <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yasser Arafat</ENAMEX> will now delay the
declaration of a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Palestinian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, which had been planned for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 4</TIMEX>, until the
end of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ha'aretz</ENAMEX> attributed this report to
"<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> close to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Palestinian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX>," while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yediot Aharanot</ENAMEX> gave it
as the opinion of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Special Middle East</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Coordinator</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dennis Ross</ENAMEX>, as
contained in a "secret report" from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israeli</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Embassy</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> to the
foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ministry</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jerusalem</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ha'aretz</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arafat</ENAMEX> is ready to
negotiate a new date with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, with the most likely one being
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Dec. 31</TIMEX>, the eve of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the new millennium</TIMEX>. It said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arafat</ENAMEX> was willing to negotiate
this postponement because he fears that a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Palestinian</ENAMEX> independence declaration
on the eve of an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israeli</ENAMEX> election would give <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Netanyahu</ENAMEX> a boost.

            In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nezavisimaya Gazeta</ENAMEX> said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX> that the idea of a
Russo-American <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partnership</ENAMEX> is now a dead <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">duck</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> is angry about
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX>'s criticisms of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Operation Desert Fox</ENAMEX>, while <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moscow</ENAMEX> is angry with the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX> for boycotting <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> research <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> as a punishment for them
allegedly having supplied nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missile</ENAMEX> technology to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> is
pragmatic and dedicated exclusively to the promotion of its own interests, the
paper said, and it is time that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moscow</ENAMEX> realized this. "Why beat on a closed
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">door?</ENAMEX>" it asked. "Why do it now when the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> so frequently demonstrates its
dissatisfaction with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> stand on many issues, and is even prepared to
punish us for it?"

            Meanwhile, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Segodnya</ENAMEX> reported that there is no
sign of the documents cited by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">National Security Adviser</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandy Berger</ENAMEX> as proof
of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX>'s nuclear cooperation with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX>. "The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US Administration</ENAMEX> stated on
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 12</TIMEX> that all documents on 'the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Iranian</ENAMEX> case' have been transferred to
the competent <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> through diplomatic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX>," Segodnya
said. "This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX> tried to trace these documents in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moscow</ENAMEX>, but failed to
find them in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Security Council</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Security</ENAMEX>
Service, or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Foreign Ministry</ENAMEX>. Neither could the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Embassy</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moscow</ENAMEX> say to which address these documents had been dispatched."
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> added that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moscow</ENAMEX> is now preparing to publicly accuse <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> of
defamation. Denying all the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> allegations, an unnamed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Russian</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intelligence</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> interviewed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX> blamed them on "the current
political situation in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX>." The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> added, "Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">faction</ENAMEX> probably used
'the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Iranian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor</ENAMEX>' artificially to complicate relations with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX>."

            On the new <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boris Yeltsin</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vremya</ENAMEX> said his "acute
hemorrhaging ulcer of the stomach" was bad news for several reasons. "First, a
hemorrhaging ulcer is a serious and painful disease, which even younger
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> find it difficult to combat. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, this reveals the full extent of
the incompetence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX>," the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> said. "Too many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cooks</ENAMEX>
spoil the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">broth</ENAMEX>, as the saying goes. The best <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> either
didn't notice the development of ulcer in the case of their important <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>,
or they themselves produced it by filling the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> up with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pills</ENAMEX> before
the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">New Year</TIMEX>." <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vremya</ENAMEX> also pointed out that to this day <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">President</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeltsin</ENAMEX> remains the only guarantee "against which international financial
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX> would agree to give further credits to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moscow</ENAMEX> or to postpone the
repayment of its debts, provided <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeltsin</ENAMEX> promised to make the Primakov
government pursue a reasonable economic policy."

            The main story across <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX> was the massacre at
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Racak</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kosovo</ENAMEX> in which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Albanians</ENAMEX> were killed, with many newspapers
demanding steps by the West to bring the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">perpetrators</ENAMEX> to justice. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX>,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX>'s edition of Le
Monde carried an editorial, headlined "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">There Will Be Other Racaks</ENAMEX>,"
saying that the massacre had been wholly predictable because the West "didn't
even give itself the means to be taken seriously by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milosevic</ENAMEX>. ... Once again,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Racak</ENAMEX>, they multiply their warnings and threats, and send <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generals</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Belgrade</ENAMEX>, when they should be putting on a show of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> on the
ground."

            In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX>, the liberal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guardian</ENAMEX> said
that war over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kosovo</ENAMEX> will be inevitable if <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> and western Europeans
don't send in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX>. "This will almost certainly have to be a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX> rather than
a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Nations</ENAMEX> operation, as in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bosnia</ENAMEX>," the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guardian</ENAMEX> said. "It will
especially be a test for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX>, and of their new
understanding on security matters, since the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> is unlikely to be
willing to contribute more than a token number of ground <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX>."

            The conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daily Telegraph</ENAMEX>
also argued for a tough line, saying that "the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">atrocity</ENAMEX> cannot
be allowed to go unpunished" and that if the culpability of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Serb</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">police</ENAMEX> was
established, "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milosevic</ENAMEX> should face indictment as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commander</ENAMEX>-in-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Yugoslav</ENAMEX> security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX>, with ultimate responsibility for their actions. ...
As for stopping the killing, only drastic measures are likely to work, such as
deployment of a fully armed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX> deterrent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX>, as is being proposed in some
quarters of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>."

            In an editorial Monday
devoted to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> impeachment, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times of London</ENAMEX> said
that only a confession by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> that he had lied under
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross</ENAMEX>-examination could bring the trial to a swift end. But instead he will
continue to rely on public opinion to keep his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">jurors</ENAMEX> from convicting him, and
in his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State of the Union</ENAMEX> message will "propose scores of popular
measures designed to secure poll ratings, even if they have no chance of
entering law." The editorial continued, "He is rightly confident that that by
such means he can maintain himself in power. But he should also be concerned
about his reputation. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin Luther King</ENAMEX>, whose memory <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> celebrate
today, once asserted: 'On truth there can be no ambiguity, on justice no
compromise.' "
