            I do not have a fleet of
washing machines in which to conduct my tests. I don't have a radiation
spectrometer for measuring the whiteness of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX> the way Consumer
Reports does. But I do have tools formidable in their own right at my
service in my search for the best laundry <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">detergent</ENAMEX>.

            I have a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">laundromat</ENAMEX>
right across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> from my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX>. I have skin sensitive to the
faintest of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">soapy residues</ENAMEX> and an equally sensitive nose. But my biggest asset
is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York City</ENAMEX> at my doorstep. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dirt</ENAMEX>, grime, spit, and fouler substances
that regularly adhere to one's clothing here make this fine metropolis a
veritable fantasia of filth.

            But first let me rule out a few of the myths and scams of
the laundry world.

            
               Laundry
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Balls/Rings</ENAMEX>
               : <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Strange</ENAMEX>, hard balls or rings--<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$30 to $90</NUMEX>
apiece--that purport to wash clothes without <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">detergent</ENAMEX> by means of generating
ions, or an undefined <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substance</ENAMEX> called "structured <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>." An apparently bogus
product: Both <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Good Housekeeping</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dateline NBC</ENAMEX> have suggested
that they wash clothes no better than plain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX> was
sued for false advertising.

            
               Ultra
Concentrates
               : Remember how <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 years ago</TIMEX> laundry
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">detergent</ENAMEX> came in huge boxes? Don't they seem small <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these days</TIMEX>? This was no
technological advance. Under pressure from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">environmentalists</ENAMEX>, detergent
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturers</ENAMEX> simply removed the fillers with which they'd been bulking up
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">detergents</ENAMEX> to give an illusion of value. (The same thing happened with
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liquids</ENAMEX>--they just eliminated the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>.)

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Powder</ENAMEX> vs.
Liquid
               : In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Consumer Reports</ENAMEX> study
showed that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">powders outperformed liquids</ENAMEX> on all fronts. (The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> exception:
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tide With Bleach Alternative</ENAMEX>.) Conventional wisdom (as doled out on laundry Web
sites and detergent hotlines) has it that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">powders</ENAMEX> are better in hard water and
for ground<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-in dirt</ENAMEX>, while <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liquids</ENAMEX> are good for grease, but this was not backed
up by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CR</ENAMEX> 's study.

            Here's the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dirt</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">detergent</ENAMEX>. There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> key
ingredients: surfactants and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">builders</ENAMEX>. Surfactants reduce the surface tension
of the water and increase its ability to rinse and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wash. Whimsical chemists</ENAMEX> say
they make <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> wetter. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Builders</ENAMEX> create the proper pH balance and deactivate
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> that would reduce the effectiveness of surfactants.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Detergents</ENAMEX> differ in the way they balance these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX>, and in their
varying use of added ingredients such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bleach</ENAMEX>, enzymes, fluorescent
whiteners, perfumes, foam control products, or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fabric softeners</ENAMEX>.

            This all presents an analytical conundrum. If each
brand merely offers the same basic ingredients in different proportions, plus
or minus a few bells and whistles, how was I to determine which was the best? I
decided I'd take each <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">detergent</ENAMEX> on its own terms. The most common label claims
boasted of keeping colors bright, removing stains, eliminating odors, and being
free of skin-irritating perfumes and dyes.

            To the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">laundromat</ENAMEX>!

            C olor 
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fastness Test</ENAMEX>: Since the
arrival of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">detergents</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bleach</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bleach</ENAMEX> alternatives, color fading has
been a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> of many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">launderers</ENAMEX>; various brands have accordingly begun to
claim "color hold" bleaching or even that they "brighten brights while
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whitening whites</ENAMEX>." Normal chlorine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bleach</ENAMEX> removes color indiscriminately: It
attacks stains and dyes alike and converts them into particles that your
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">detergent</ENAMEX> can easily wash away. It can also damage fabrics (especially
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">materials</ENAMEX> such as silk and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wool</ENAMEX>). In general, "color-safe" bleach
just means <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen bleach</ENAMEX>, which is much milder than <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chlorine bleach</ENAMEX>. It works
by releasing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hydrogen peroxide</ENAMEX> to break up or remove the color from organic
materials but is gentle enough that it won't affect most fabric dyes. That
stuff about brightening brights generally just means the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">detergent</ENAMEX> has some
dye-transfer <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX>, which help to stop bleeding dyes from staining other
clothes. There's nothing in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">detergent</ENAMEX> that can make your clothes brighter,
other that its inherent ability to get <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dirt</ENAMEX> out of them.

            Of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">detergents</ENAMEX> with color-safe bleaches, I tested
All and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wisk</ENAMEX> (both in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">powder form</ENAMEX>), setting them against Liquid <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tide With</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Bleach Alternative</ENAMEX>, which was rated the most effective detergent overall by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Consumer Reports</ENAMEX> , but which made no claims to color safety or
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">brightening</ENAMEX>. I hit the infantwear section of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kmart</ENAMEX> and picked up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> cheap
sets of clothing. Each included a tiny red T-shirt, a blue turtleneck, pink
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">long johns</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> pairs of socks--one lime green, one vibrant purple. I felt
as if I was the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smurfs</ENAMEX>. I then washed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of the sets <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> times
each, in hot water, with each of the fine household products I mentioned
above.

            After <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">14 washings</TIMEX>, the
washed sets of clothing had lost significant amounts of color as compared with
the unwashed control set. The socks that started out a deep royal purple were
now lavender and covered with whitish fuzz. The differences among All, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wisk</ENAMEX>,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tide</ENAMEX> were not great, but they were noticeable and surprising. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tide</ENAMEX>, which
made no claims to color holding, actually resulted in the least fading. All
came in <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wisk</ENAMEX> just a shade behind. These differences were only
noticeable under bright light and on close inspection--indicative of the
general irrelevance of the claims on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">detergent</ENAMEX> labels. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> way to prevent this
type of color loss is to wash clothes in colder <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, but all <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">detergents</ENAMEX> work
poorly in cold <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, and many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bleaching agents</ENAMEX> are completely ineffective in
cold temperatures. So while the colors may fade less, your <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">detergent</ENAMEX> is also
cleaning less.

            S tain 
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Removal Test</ENAMEX>: For the stain
removal I needed a way of getting the clothes to be tested as dirty as
possible, and what is dirtier that the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>? I figured I'd throw
the test <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> and let <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> run over them. But this presented
a new testing challenge, namely that anything in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York City</ENAMEX> is
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fair</ENAMEX> game. I was faced with either standing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guard</ENAMEX> over the clothing and shooing
away would-be <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">thieves</ENAMEX>, or picking as my test <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> attire that was a
natural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> repellent. I picked underwear, both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>'s and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>'s, in the
most gargantuan sizes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kmart</ENAMEX> carried and, with the help of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX>, threw <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>
pairs into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Second Avenue</ENAMEX> under cover of darkness. Unfortunately, while no one
wanted the clothing, the act of tossing it into the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> drew no little
attention. Questions from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX> that gathered included "What the hell are
you doing?" "Are you <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys artists</ENAMEX>?" "Can I have your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">number</ENAMEX>?" "I'm in a band
called <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">'Bag of Panties</ENAMEX>.' Will you take a picture of us with the underwear for
our album cover?"

            It was all very
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">diverting</ENAMEX>, but it wasn't getting our underwear any dirtier. So we dragged each
pair through the gutter (which was still full of street runoff from a rainstorm
earlier in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX>). This combined with the occasional big <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rig</ENAMEX> and regular
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> taxi traffic did quite a number on the briefs. After an hour
they were gray and covered with skid marks and street custard.

            But they still weren't dirty enough. So into a plastic sack
they went, and into a cab we hopped, headed for the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Cowgirl Hall of Fame</ENAMEX>, a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Western</ENAMEX>-themed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Greenwich Village</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cooks</ENAMEX> there were kind
enough to donate a large platter and a vat of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spicy barbecue sauce</ENAMEX>, but balked
at putting BBQ-Brief <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sandwiches</ENAMEX> on the menu. Even sitting on the platter
thoroughly sauced, the briefs still looked like they needed one more good
stain. So off we went to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Krispy Kreme</ENAMEX> for a dozen raspberry <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">jelly</ENAMEX> doughnuts to
squirt all over them. With that final abuse, we called it a night, and I sealed
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> in a large plastic bag and left them to fester in the corner of my
room for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two days</TIMEX>.

            After dividing the briefs
into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> equally soiled piles, I washed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> set in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cheer</ENAMEX>, one in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tide</ENAMEX>, one in
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dynamo</ENAMEX>, and one in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Fare</ENAMEX> (a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kmart</ENAMEX> store <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">brand</ENAMEX>). After one wash and a
spin in the dryer, I compared the results. Cheer worked the best overall: It
removed the road grime the best, and there was little trace of the orange
grease left in the waistband by the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">barbecue sauce</ENAMEX>. There was no visible
raspberry jelly doughnut filling remaining at all. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tide</ENAMEX> did a good job on the
grease but was not quite as effective as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cheer</ENAMEX> on the road grime, which was
still visible in patches. It also completely removed the jelly stains. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>
place went to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dynamo</ENAMEX>, which did a poor job on the jelly, and whose heavy scent
couldn't completely mask the odor of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">barbecue sauce</ENAMEX>. Worst of all was Kmart
brand: When I opened the dryer, the spicy smell of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">barbecue sauce</ENAMEX> almost
knocked me over, and the briefs were still covered in splotches of orange
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">grease</ENAMEX> and jelly stains.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> dor 
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Removal Test</ENAMEX>: For this test I
enlisted the help of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> who is a fitness <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">instructor</ENAMEX>. She was kind enough
to donate <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> loads of sweaty, crusty clothes to my cause. Using my
incredibly sensitive nose, I divided her clothing into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> piles of equal
stink factor (and threw in the still-spicy undies from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kmart</ENAMEX> detergent
load). I then washed each in a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">detergent</ENAMEX> marketed as odor removing: <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Gain, Surf</ENAMEX>,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fab</ENAMEX>. Aside from just having more fragrance than other varieties (which the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> admit), could they actually remove serious stink from clothing?

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fab</ENAMEX> and Gain both did a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">great</ENAMEX> job and removed the odors completely. There was no difference in
stink-removal effectiveness between these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>, aside from the perfume left in
the clothing. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fab's</ENAMEX> was plain--a light, clean scent--while Gain's was vaguely
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vanilloid</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Surf</ENAMEX> came in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last</TIMEX>. It did not completely remove pit stink, and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">perfume</ENAMEX> was a cloying grape scent. Worst of all, the toxic underwear from the
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">barbecue sauce</ENAMEX> ordeal still smelled <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spicy</ENAMEX>.

            My conclusions? Tide faded colors a bit less, but it was
not enough to make me want to switch brands. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cheer</ENAMEX> did a great job removing
dirt and grease, but how often are my clothes run over by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> and slathered in
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">barbecue sauce</ENAMEX>? About once a year.

            The differences among the name brands were
negligible. The various claims on the packaging are not so much false as true
of all the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">detergents</ENAMEX>: With the exception of the cheap store brands, they all
remove odors, stains, and dirt <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">well</ENAMEX>. You're better off picking your detergent
by its scent (or, if you ask me, lack thereof) than you are judging it by
what's on the label. But among the top-shelf brands, it doesn't really matter
which one you choose: It'll all come out in the wash.
