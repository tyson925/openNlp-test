Wrap-Up
            

            When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspan</ENAMEX> speaks,
everyone listens because we have money riding on his remarks. Whether through a
mutual fund, mortgage, or credit card, we've each placed a bet on the economy,
and it's a lot more exciting to watch the game when you have a little something
on it. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A few years ago</TIMEX>, I watched an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCAA</ENAMEX> basketball playoff game at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caesar</ENAMEX>'s
sports book in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vegas</ENAMEX>. It was the most intensely engaged <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> I'd ever seen
at any dramatic production. And that's the basis of my election reform plan.
Forget motor-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voter</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> will go to the polls if you let them bet on the
outcome. You can already do it legally in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX> and, except for royal
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">marriages</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin Amis</ENAMEX> book advances, their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">society</ENAMEX> is intact. Here's how it
would work. When you vote, you get a ticket that allows you to legally bet on
the election at any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OTB</ENAMEX>. Try it next time in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Hampshire</ENAMEX>, and turnout will go
up by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">at least 50 percent</NUMEX>. I'd bet on it.

            Addressing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Banking Committee</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspan</ENAMEX> was referring to the current wave of mergers.
While some will undoubtedly fail, he said, there will be no bailouts using
public money. Asked if he was concerned about the increased concentration of
economic power, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspan</ENAMEX> replied, "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">No.</ENAMEX>"

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Valentine</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Day</ENAMEX> is past,
but if you still need handcuffs, evidence kits, radar <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX>, battering rams, and
some very attractive clothing, try the catalog from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gall's Inc.</ENAMEX>, "<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>'s
largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">supplier</ENAMEX> to public safety <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX>." I use the print version, but

               "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ThunderwearÂ® Holster</ENAMEX>. This unique design allows you to hide your weapon
inside the front of your trousers. <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$42.99</NUMEX>."--No fancy symbolism, no easy irony,
no dime-store <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Freud</ENAMEX>, just straightforward gun underwear. Oh yes, my cynical
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">friend</ENAMEX>, that is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pistol</ENAMEX> in my pants and I am glad to see
you.

               "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">StabPro Vests</ENAMEX>. Because <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">They Have Nothing To Lose</ENAMEX>. It can happen anywhere:
in the yard, in cell extraction or transporting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prisoners</ENAMEX>. Suddenly, they
attack you with razor blades, shanks, picks, shivs, or sharpened rebar. They
swing chair legs, pipes and mop handles. And when nothing's left, they use
their fists and their feet. Because what are you going to do? Toss them in
jail? <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$459.99</NUMEX> and up."--I'll never complain about those <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seventeen</ENAMEX>
magazine editorial meetings ever again.

               "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Trico's Transport Cell</ENAMEX>. Transporting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prisoners</ENAMEX> can be tough on your
vehicle interior. Blood stains on the carpet and seats, torn headliners, marred
door panels, not to mention broken windows all add to your frustration.

combination-lock briefcases in less than a minute without damaging the locks.
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$14.99</NUMEX> each."--Only slightly more expensive than a legally obtained search
warrant.

               "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Polycarbonate Riot Batons</ENAMEX>. This virtually indestructible baton is great
for use in riot & <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX> control situations and comes with a lifetime

warp, dent, or splinter. <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$49.95</NUMEX>."--It's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giuliani</ENAMEX>-tough,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giuliani</ENAMEX>-affordable.
