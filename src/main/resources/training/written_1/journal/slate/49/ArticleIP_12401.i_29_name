Wrap-Up
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Caricature</ENAMEX> is so
reassuring and so rare. It's not often you meet a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cow</ENAMEX> that says "moo," a bird
that says "tweet," or an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> special <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> that says "The perp got his kick."
But when it happens, you know where you are--in front of the television, dozing
contentedly, while <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> say "stat" and cops say "dirt bag" and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Brokaw</ENAMEX>
says "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drug lords</ENAMEX>" and "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX>," and "I want that stat, you dirt bag!" to
some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poor</ENAMEX> production <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assistant</ENAMEX> who's doing the best he can. No, wait, it was
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cow</ENAMEX> who said that; she's so much crankier in real life than in the cartoon
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">barnyard</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brokaw</ENAMEX> is, by all accounts, an amiable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fellow</ENAMEX>, who can be found of an
evening swapping <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX> stories with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maureen Dowd</ENAMEX>. What a great time!
Love that part about the sense of national purpose and the black market tires
and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of dead <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russians</ENAMEX>. OK, not the tires. Who brought that up,
anyway? Probably that damn cartoon <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bird</ENAMEX>, if by "tweet, tweet," she meant
"<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> bund" or "internment <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camp</ENAMEX>." But maybe she didn't. Maybe she
just meant "Sleep tight, you morons!" Happy <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">New Year</TIMEX>, everyone.

            As <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deb Stavin</ENAMEX> knew (click ), phoning in a bogus
anthrax scare is the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX> version of phoning in a bogus bomb scare.

            "It just seems to be the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">wacko</ENAMEX>'s flavor of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the month</TIMEX>," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scafidi</ENAMEX> says, of what has become a particularly
vexing genre of prank phones call in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>, as well as in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colorado</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kentucky</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tennessee</ENAMEX>. And although hazardous materials <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> know that most
calls are hoaxes, "You always have to treat a threat as real," says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark</ENAMEX>

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. "I have shifted things to be more family
targeted, because we're already bringing in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>."

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. "It's easier to see the evidence of the money
they spent in froufrou on the plate--swirls, complexity, multiple
