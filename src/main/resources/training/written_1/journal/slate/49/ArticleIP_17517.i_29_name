Killer
            

            Even those of you who never met him, and possibly
didn't appreciate his e-mail missives urging you to subscribe, are going to
miss our retiring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">publisher</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rogers Weed</ENAMEX>, if for no other reason than his name.
Where could we possibly find a better named <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">publisher</ENAMEX> than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rogers Weed</ENAMEX>? (Now
that he's leaving, the full drama can be revealed: It's actually <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alonzo Rogers</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">Weed</ENAMEX>.)

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rogers</ENAMEX> was <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">publisher</ENAMEX> of 
                  Slate
                for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two</TIMEX>
and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a half years</TIMEX>, in other words almost since the beginning. With business
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">savvy</ENAMEX>, personal charm, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>-style hard-nosed determination, he
mastered the horrors of magazine economics, learned to tolerate the
eccentricities of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalists</ENAMEX>, and set 
                  Slate
                on the path to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">success</ENAMEX>. He is leaving us to become marketing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Windows CE</ENAMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> operating system for pocket computers and other small appliances. We
don't blame him. We're not bitter. The appliances may be small, but the
business is large. At least potentially. And we at 
                  Slate
                are not
ones to sneer at potential. We do like to think that small appliances lack the
glamour and social importance of magazine journalism, but then small appliances
themselves probably feel otherwise. And <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rogers</ENAMEX> will be hanging out with small
appliances from now on, so he can give us a report. Maybe we'll even sign him
up for a "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dialogue</ENAMEX>" with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PalmPilot</ENAMEX>.

            Good luck, Rog!

            Our new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publisher</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scott Moore</ENAMEX>, who joins us from
his previous job as advertising <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Expedia</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> travel site. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scott</ENAMEX> also has many
fine qualities, and the entire 
                  Slate
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">team</ENAMEX> looks forward to
straining them to the limit.

            Good luck, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scott</ENAMEX>!

            
               And <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Don't Call Me</ENAMEX>
Surly!
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Commentators</ENAMEX>, including

                  Slate
               's own , have accused a few <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">surliness</ENAMEX> and worse for boycotting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State</ENAMEX> of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Union</ENAMEX> address <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> or for sitting there looking ostentatiously
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unenthralled</ENAMEX>. This is puzzling. It's the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX> who are supposed to be
pretending that we can conduct business as usual during an impeachment trial.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> are supposed to be pretending that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Clinton</ENAMEX> has committed
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">offenses</ENAMEX> so heinous that he should be the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> ever forcibly evicted
from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>. If they really believe this, of 
               course they
shouldn't sit there respectfully and applaud the items they approve of on his
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">endless</TIMEX> wish list. Most <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX>, though, did precisely that, reflecting the
official party line that you can impeach the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> and reform <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Security</ENAMEX> (and, no doubt, walk and chew <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gum</ENAMEX>) at the same time. This may be a
wise strategy for minimizing public annoyance at the whole impeachment thing.
But it makes a mockery of the whole thing too. If congressional <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX>
aren't going to act as if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Flytrap</ENAMEX> is as serious as the result they seek, why
should anyone else?

            
               Inside
Debunker
            

            We'll soon be launching a new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> called
"<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Debunker</ENAMEX>," noting interesting errors of fact, logic, or mathematics in the
news. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> will be <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jonathan Chait</ENAMEX>, who is conversing with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jodie T. Allen</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</TIMEX> at "." Suggestions are welcome at debunker@slate.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">com</ENAMEX>. It's too bad <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Debunker</ENAMEX> (someone
suggested we call it "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">CrapShoot"</ENAMEX>) isn't up and running now, because there were
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> of nice examples in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State of the Union</ENAMEX> .

            Take <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s
proposal to invest part of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> revenues in the stock market.
Characteristically splitting the difference with conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX>
privatization <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enthusiasts</ENAMEX>, he does not propose to let <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> invest the money
for themselves or to make benefits contingent on how well the investment
performs. These are terrible ideas ( to find out why), but without them the
notion is simply empty.

            There's a pile of money called the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security Trust</ENAMEX>
Fund. (Is there really a pile of money? Well, leave that aside.) Money comes in
through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> (FICA) tax and goes out in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX>
benefits. Someday, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boomers</ENAMEX> retire in hordes, more will go out than will
come in. Right now, though, more comes in than goes out, and the excess is
invested in government bonds. The stock market historically has a higher rate
of return than government bonds do. So the argument is that putting some of the
money in stocks will make the trust fund more profitable and avoid, or at least
put off, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> it runs out of money.

            Leaving aside the rate of
return question for a moment, consider the whole transaction. When the trust
fund puts <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1</NUMEX> into private markets instead of into government bonds (i.e., the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">national</ENAMEX> debt, which is still here although the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> deficit is not), the
general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">treasury</ENAMEX> must then borrow <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1</NUMEX> more from those same private markets. If
you believe that the trust fund is an accounting fiction (the government
borrowing from itself, paying itself interest, and writing checks that are
government commitments irrespective of the fund), then the transaction is a
total wash. If you believe that the trust fund exists, then the transaction
amounts to a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1</NUMEX> increase in both the trust fund and the national debt--sort of
a pre-emptive bailout.

            How does the higher rate of return on private stocks change
things? Well, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> is now supposedly borrowing each of these dollars
from the private sector for, say, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4 percent</NUMEX> and investing them in the private
sector for a return of, say, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 percent</NUMEX>. Nice deal! Too nice. If arbitrage were
so simple and foolproof, why shouldn't we invest the whole trust fund in
private stocks? And why stop there? Why not issue <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">hundreds of billions</NUMEX> in
government bonds and plow the money into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fidelity</ENAMEX> Magellan? (OK, that would be
irresponsible. So make it an index fund.)

            Come to think of it,
what is wrong with all these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who own government bonds? Don't they
realize that selling a bond is just like issuing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>? You get cash, which you
invest in stocks for a higher return. Why aren't the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heritage Foundation</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al.</ENAMEX>, advocating this? It's the ultimate: privatizing privatization.

            Obviously, there's a catch. Government bonds have a lower
historic return than stocks because stocks are riskier--and the market has
decided exactly how large a premium that risk is worth. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> win <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Nobel Prizes</ENAMEX>
for figuring out how to minimize the risk of investing in stocks. But even
these geniuses aren't <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alchemists</ENAMEX>: They can't make something out of nothing, and
they can't produce a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Garrison Keillor</ENAMEX> financial world where everybody does
above average--or (same thing) where everybody enjoys a risk premium without
taking a risk.

            Ask yourself: If the
government gets more money as a result of investing <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">billions</NUMEX> in the private
sector, where does that money come from? Not from higher capital investment:
The net effect of investing <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1</NUMEX> and borrowing <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1</NUMEX> is zilch. And not, presumably,
from any management improvement because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> owns large chunks of
private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>. Indeed, to ease fears of government meddling, the plan is to
make these investments as passive as possible. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Passive</ENAMEX> investment--money that
settles for an average return--on balance reduces that average, because active
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX>, who are constantly acquiring, processing, and acting on information,
make the economy more efficient.

            So the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>'s windfall, if it exists, would have to
come at the expense of rival private <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX>. For this to happen, the
government would not merely have to match the average return on stocks but
would have to beat it--regularly, guaranteed, forever. Unlikely--wouldn't you
say?--even if the plan weren't expressly to hit the average. So the
windfall would not come from private <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> and would not come from economic
expansion. It also wouldn't come from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreigners</ENAMEX> or the moon. Conclusion: This
windfall would melt away.

            How? Good ol' supply and
demand. When the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> wants to borrow an extra dollar and put it in the
stock market, someone else must be enticed to sell a dollar's worth of stock to
buy government bonds. The interest the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> must pay on its borrowing
goes up, and the return it can expect on the stocks it buys goes down (because
it must pay more for the same shares). Since these changes would affect all
government borrowing and investment, not just this particular program, the gap
would not have to close completely for the whole exercise to end up a wash. The
math is beyond us, but we're willing to bet that--on some reasonable
assumptions--that's precisely what happens.

            
               At
Home
            

            A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> logical fallacy is easier to explain but
harder to believe. In his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</TIMEX> address, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> also called for a
tax credit for "stay at home <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>." Family values <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enthusiasts</ENAMEX> have long
claimed that the tax credit for day care unfairly discriminates against stay at
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home moms</ENAMEX>. Some even maintain that the credit is an exercise in liberal social
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">engineering</ENAMEX>, intended to pry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> away from their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and into the
workplace. If all it takes is another tax credit to pacify <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> of the
original one, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> is happy to oblige.

            However, the truth is
that even with the current credit, the tax code discriminates in favor
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> who stay home with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> and against those who get a
paying job and pay in turn for day care. That's because there's no tax on the
imputed income of taking care of your own <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>.

            Now wait, now wait. I told you it was hard to believe. But
before you dismiss it as everything-belongs-to-the<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">-government</ENAMEX>,
my-goodness-they'll-want-to-tax-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">farting</NUMEX>-next liberal nonsense, consider an
example. Suppose I am taking care of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> and you are taking care of your
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>. No tax on that. But suppose I pay you to take care of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> and you pay
me to take care of yours. Suppose the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> are equally adorable and/or
troublesome and we pay each other the same amount. It's a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wash</ENAMEX>, in terms of
effort and cash. But suddenly we both owe taxes.

            When a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> decides to
work for pay and to buy services she might otherwise provide for herself, she
is bringing those services into the money economy, where they are subject to
the same rules as other economic activity. Day care is just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> example;
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">restaurants</ENAMEX> and prepared <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> are another. An analogous principle applies to
how you put your money to work. (You'll really hate this one.) If you buy a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">house</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$100,000</NUMEX>, you get to live in it without paying any income tax for the
privilege. But if you bank that <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$100,000</NUMEX> and use the interest to pay rent, you
have to pay income tax on the interest. (You pay property tax as an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owner</ENAMEX>, of
course, but you pay it implicitly as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">renter</ENAMEX> too.)

            Don't worry, no one is proposing to make you pay a tax on
the implicit <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$4.95</NUMEX> you paid yourself <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> to open up a can of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">tuna fish</ENAMEX> and
toast <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> pieces of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bread</ENAMEX> rather than buying a sandwich from the local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">deli</ENAMEX>.
And no one is going to tax you on the salary you're not paying yourself for
child care. The purpose of the child care credit is to correct, only partially,
the tax code's prejudice against working <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>.

            If you want to give yet another tax break to stay at
home <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> because you want to encourage <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> to stay at home with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>
or just because you love tax breaks for anything at all, fine. But it's not a
matter of fairness or government neutrality. The opposite, in fact.
