            The true irresponsibility
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth Starr</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> who turned an innocent affair
into a national crisis is only now becoming clear. Yes, our <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> month
distraction is now over, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> can return to discussing education
reform and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> as they claim to prefer. Yes, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Clinton</ENAMEX> was not
evicted from office. But that doesn't mean our long national nightmare is over.
In fact, it is just beginning.

            Already there are hints
of the trouble ahead. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past year</TIMEX>, our former-peacenik <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> has
launched missile attacks on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Osama bin Laden</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX> at the oddest of
times. The surest-footed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politician</ENAMEX> of our era held a crass partisan pep rally
smack in the middle of the impeachment process. And on the eve of his acquittal
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX>, he allegedly let slip that his next major policy initiative is
retaliating against impeachment foes. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> strongly denies the last
item. But let's face it: It fits a pattern.

            Despite the indignant denials of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>'s pursuers,
we're about to discover that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Flytrap</ENAMEX> is indeed about sex. Or at least that the
post<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">-Flytrap</ENAMEX> era is going to be about lack of sex. Now that it's permissible to
talk about such matters, some big questions arise: With whom is the president
having sexual relations? (Or, to use <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s brilliant euphemism, "not having
sexual relations.") When was the last time? Is he getting any at all?

            This is serious stuff.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>, a k a "the most powerful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> in the world," (and this one is
known for his large appetite, to boot) has been collared. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charismatic</ENAMEX>, suffused
with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Kissinger</ENAMEX>'s ultimate aphrodisiac, and looking fitter than ever, our
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> nevertheless faces odds of scoring that have to be slimmer than
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beavis</ENAMEX>' or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Butt-Head's</ENAMEX>.

            Consider the obvious. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Long-suffering</ENAMEX>, yes. But a
return to the crime scene any time soon? Doubtful. Out of respect for the first
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lady</ENAMEX>, enough said. Any other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX>? Equally doubtful. With all eyes on the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>, both inside and outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>, where is there even a
trysting place, now that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oval Office</ENAMEX> has been discovered? And would
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>, hanging so tenuously to his legacy, risk what's left by working back
channels with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Secret Service</ENAMEX> to bring in concupiscent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conscripts</ENAMEX> while
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary</ENAMEX>'s out of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>? Well, one hesitates to say with certainty that this
particular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> ever learns from experience on this particular subject,
but surely, surely , at this point ... after all that's happened ...
knowing what's at stake. Well, I guess the most we can say is: probably
not.

            So, outside of some safe
phone sex, it's a reasonable bet to conclude that the most powerful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">world</ENAMEX> has to be, well, testy. And if so, that sure explains a lot. Missile
strikes against his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enemies</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Hello</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Freud</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Carville</ENAMEX>, his personified
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">id</ENAMEX>, declaring war on political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foes</ENAMEX>. This isn't rational behavior. It's more
befitting a hormonally unbalanced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teenager</ENAMEX> who is acting out.

            This is very different from the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Wag the Dog</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypothesis</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> isn't engaging in military action to distract public
attention from his sexual activity. He's engaging in military action to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">distract</ENAMEX> himself from his lack of sexual activity.

            And the notion of a hormonally unbalanced national
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX>, with the world's most powerful <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">arsenal</ENAMEX> and fighting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> at his
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">command</ENAMEX>, is profoundly frightening.

            What to do? First, as a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nation</ENAMEX>, we must accept that our very human and virile <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> has very human
and virile needs that aren't being met. Denial is not an option. Believe me,
I've run this by a high-school "health education" <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, rechanneling
this energy has its limits. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> can save <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX>, protect the
environment, improve public schooling, and help elect <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Gore</ENAMEX> but, at the end
of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX>, the problem hasn't gone away.

            <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, we need to cut the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> some slack. If the
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX>'s job description no longer includes being first, then let's lobby
to create a new post, the last <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX>--or the latest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX>. Unconstitutional? Then
how about more conventional remedies? Road trips. Prostitution is legal in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vegas</ENAMEX>. Or how about offshore <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R & R</ENAMEX>? Visit <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Subic Bay Naval</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX>, rally
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX>, or salute their memory, whatever, as long as there's time for
off-base socializing.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> way or another, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>'s needs must be
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ministered</ENAMEX> to (to borrow another terrific <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Flytrap</ENAMEX> euphemism). We will all sleep
better at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> knowing that our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commander in chief</ENAMEX>'s libido is
compartmentalized, and that he's not bombing <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Sudanese</ENAMEX> pharmaceutical plants
just to get his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iraqs</ENAMEX> off.
