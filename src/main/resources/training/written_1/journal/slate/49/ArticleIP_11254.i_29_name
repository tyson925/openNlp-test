<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> headed home to face his own." That's the caption to a grim
front-page photo in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> . <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Participants</ENAMEX> are invited
to submit a caption sure to appear on the front of any paper <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> after the

"<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> : An emotional but poised <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">first lady</ENAMEX> announces the death

<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>'s injuries as 'small puncture wounds in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> and chest, roughly

            I'll say it directly:
Read the directions. The question called for a photo caption, not a headline.
Believing a firm response was demanded, I've relegated such inapt answers to
Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Click</ENAMEX> for some quite amusing if not entirely germane replies.) My
actions came without warning but not without repeated provocation. Indeed, as
recently as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November</TIMEX>, I refrained from this course only at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the eleventh hour</TIMEX>.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Eleventh and a half</TIMEX>. Undoubtedly my timing will be questioned. So let me assure
you that this is in no way intended to deter any proceedings under way in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House of Representatives</ENAMEX>, no matter how idiotic. May God bless the brave men
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNN</ENAMEX> who will be working so hard and with such pleasure in the
coming <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>. God bless <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>.
