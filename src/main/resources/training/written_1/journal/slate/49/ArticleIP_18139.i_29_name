Wrap-Up
            

            While many of you made fat jokes, sedentary is not
synonymous with portly. It can also mean frail, although it is tougher to mock
the weak and physically ineffectual, unless you're <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leni Riefenstahl</ENAMEX> or an
old-school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gym teacher</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1968</TIMEX>, all sports were square and right-wing, unless
you considered <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Frisbee</ENAMEX> a sport instead of its traditional designation,
"nuisance." There were exceptions: <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harry Edwards</ENAMEX> inspired <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> track stars
to raise the black power fist at the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Mexico City Olympics</ENAMEX>. But the contemporary
meaning of athletics was reiterated on every <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Hope</ENAMEX> TV special, when he
trotted out a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">herd</ENAMEX> of college <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">football</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stars</ENAMEX> to boost the war in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vietnam</ENAMEX>.

            Now there are hip <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">athletes</ENAMEX>--snowboarders, sullen
teen skateboarders, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rollerbladers</ENAMEX>, dirt <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bikers</ENAMEX>--fighting for public space
across barriers of age, class, and hairstyle. This is not merely the triumph of
individual over <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> sports. Figure skating and gymnastics remain square; just
listen to the music, if you dare.

            It's easy to overstate the new athletics as a force
for social change, but don't count on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">surfers</ENAMEX> opposing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ludicrous</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX>-revival anti-missile plan. And while mountain <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bikes</ENAMEX> and rock
climbing are terrific, they've already been appropriated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTV</ENAMEX> as mass market
rather than mass movement.

            If sports hasn't turned
into progressive politics, at least it has been demilitarized, rejecting the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">boot</ENAMEX> camp model of recreation, and that means more fun for more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. Not so
bad. So if you want me, I'll be on my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bike</ENAMEX>, pedaling past <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leni Riefenstahl</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">house</ENAMEX>, tossing rocks. See if <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s Star Wars system can block that.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal of the American Medical Association</ENAMEX> . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> newly published studies
suggest that performing "lifestyle" exercise--raking <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">leaves</ENAMEX>, climbing
stairs--can improve heart and lung fitness as much as a vigorous workout. The
studies (noncontroversial, nonpolitical, and in no way intended to affect the
impeachment process) found that while moderate exercise does not burn many
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">calories</ENAMEX>, it is beneficial to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> who spend most of their
