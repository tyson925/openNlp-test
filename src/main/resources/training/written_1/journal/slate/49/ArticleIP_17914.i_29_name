Wrap-Up
            

            Many responses listed
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">deft</ENAMEX> and amusing <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">oxymorons</ENAMEX>, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lamar Alexander</ENAMEX> sought something more insidious
than mere self-contradiction. He was invoking the vicious and sinister
qualities that make weasels (along with stoats and ferrets) such satisfying
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">villains in Kenneth Grahame</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Wind in the Willows</ENAMEX> , and such pleasingly
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">greasy</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stooges</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">David Letterman</ENAMEX>'s epithet "record industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">weasels</ENAMEX>." (Not
half so much contempt could be squeezed from "record industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">squirrels</ENAMEX>.") That
toothy, ruthless carnivore shows up in this familiar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX>:

            

               <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Hamlet:</ENAMEX>
Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel?

               
Polonius: By the mass, and 'tis like a camel, indeed.

               <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Hamlet:</ENAMEX>
Methinks it is like a weasel

               
Polonius: It is backed like a weasel.

            

            A few lines later, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Hamlet</ENAMEX>
says, "They fool me to the top of my bent." Indeed they do, those weasels. It
makes you wonder why anyone could name a product the "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Garden Weasel</ENAMEX>" or why
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lamar Alexander</ENAMEX> thinks he has a shot at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>.

Answer
            

            "Compassionate conservative."

            <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> presidential
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hopefuls</ENAMEX> and their myrmidons are carping about the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George W. Bush</ENAMEX> catch phrase.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Religious nut Gary Bauer</ENAMEX> took it out on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush Sr.</ENAMEX>: "The last <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> talked about
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">kinder</ENAMEX> and gentler, and that resulted in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">an election</TIMEX> loss." <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan Quayle</ENAMEX> demurred
typographically, writing "I have ordered my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> to never--EVER--utter the
words 'compassionate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conservative</ENAMEX>!' " <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Forbes</ENAMEX> objected manfully,
declaring: "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mealy</ENAMEX>-mouthed rhetoric and poll-tested clich√©s are no substitute
for a muscular substantive agenda," then he took a swing at a poor person
bequeathed to him in his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>'s will. Or maybe he didn't.

            Uncanny ability to keep a straight face while saying
"Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Manager Graham</ENAMEX>" means she'd have no trouble buttering up my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX>.

            Her assertion--"Mere repetition no matter how

               Ambiguous
            

            No visible wedding ring could imply availability for
dating or recklessness at the poker table or that it's time to break down and
buy a decent television.

            Mysterious white bauble on lapel could be pale and
delicate cameo, membership pin in pernicious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>, or perhaps a dab of
