            Many <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX>
of this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX>, who was then the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Republic</ENAMEX> , coined an
aphorism for political influence <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peddlers</ENAMEX> who defended their shady methods on
the grounds that they didn't violate the law. The scandal, he observed, isn't
what's illegal, but what's legal. Since then, politics has stagnated, science
has exploded, and the art of moral rationalization has mutated to suit the new
environment. In this world, the game is redesigning human beings, the stakes
are ownership of the fountain of youth, and the scandal is what passes as
"ethical."

            Last
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arlen Specter</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pa.</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Harkin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iowa</ENAMEX>, convened a
hearing to examine the moral implications of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> recent experiments.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Researchers</ENAMEX> funded by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Geron</ENAMEX>, testified that they had taken "stem
cells" from human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">embryos</ENAMEX> and fetuses and had grown them into neurons, muscle
cells, and other tissues. Meanwhile, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">CEO</ENAMEX> of another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Advanced Cell</ENAMEX>
Technology, testified that by putting the nucleus of an adult human cell into a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cow</ENAMEX>'s gutted <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">egg</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>, his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> had converted it into an embryonic human
cell, which presumably could be manipulated in the same way. "As we learn to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> the pathways that take stem cells down the road to neurons, blood
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">vessels</ENAMEX>, and heart <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX>," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Geron</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Okarma</ENAMEX> testified,
"we can immortalize them by telomerase gene transfer, so that sufficient
quantities of these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> can be grown for transplant applications." Old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX>'
"degenerating organs" would be repaired "with young, healthy, and fully
functional cells." And <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> organs to be repaired in this way, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> promised, would be the brain.

            All this sounds wonderful. We can cure <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX>,
immortalize cells, and theoretically live forever without the nasty old moral
problem of "harvesting" fetuses. But the prospect of a human spare parts
industry modeled on cooking, farming, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> repair raises a new moral
problem. Human ingenuity--a grand synthesis of agriculture, manufacturing, and
information technology--is dissolving human nature.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ethicists</ENAMEX> who advise
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> and biotech <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX> can't comprehend the gravity of this step. Like
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX>, they dwell on details instead of the big picture. While taking care
never to cross the line, they ignore anything short of crossing it, and they
don't notice that the line is gradually receding. They look for moral problems
in costs but never in benefits. And they quarrel over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX>'s issues while
being overrun by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX>'s.

            For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>,
biotechnology ethics has been mired in the politics of abortion. Since federal
law restricts research on fetal tissue and human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">embryos</ENAMEX>, the debate over stem
cells has focused on whether they are embryos and, if not, whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX>
are killing embryos to get them. The token biotech <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critic</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX>'s
hearing, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Doerflinger</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Conference of Catholic Bishops</ENAMEX>,
ignored the novel implications of the latest experiments, complaining instead
that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> had destroyed embryos in the process. Conversely,
pro-biotech <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witnesses</ENAMEX> argued that the stem cells in the experiments were only
"pluripotent" (capable of forming many tissues), not "totipotent" (capable of
forming an entire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>), and therefore weren't organisms or embryos. "The issue
that we're dealing with," said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harold Varmus</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of the National
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institutes of Health</ENAMEX>, "is complying with the law, knowing the legal definition
of an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX>."

            
But this lawyerly parsing misses the larger
moral challenge: The distinction between <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> and nonorganisms is
collapsing. In embryonic development, totipotent cells (ostensibly organisms)
divide into pluripotent cells (ostensibly nonorganisms), which in turn divide
into cells that are "committed" to become specific tissues. The differences in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> and in degree of versatility can be subtle. Moreover, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cow</ENAMEX>-egg
experiment, like the previous cloning of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sheep</ENAMEX>, proved that the cycle is
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">reversible</ENAMEX>: "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Committed</ENAMEX>" adult cells can be restored to embryonic
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">totipotency</ENAMEX>.

            The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ethicists</ENAMEX> who testified at the hearing were obtuse to this conundrum. The
executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Bioethics Advisory Committee</ENAMEX> confessed that
in the course of discussing the stem cell experiments, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBAC</ENAMEX> hadn't got around
to the question of defining an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Doerflinger</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catholic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX>,
was so intent on asserting the unique personhood of totipotent cells that he
dismissed pluripotent cells, by contrast, as nonorganisms. Rather than confront
the new moral questions raised by stem cell technologies, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witnesses</ENAMEX> praised
them for abolishing the old moral questions. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Banks</ENAMEX> of stem cells, Varmus
observed, would reduce the need for "fetal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX>." (The biotech <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX>'
comments on "ethics" were even more diversionary. Click for an example.)

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>'s discussion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cow</ENAMEX>-<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">egg</TIMEX> experiment was
equally shallow. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harkin</ENAMEX> quoted from a letter in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> had
said he was "deeply troubled by this news of experiments involving the mingling
of human and nonhuman <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>." The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senators</ENAMEX> joined <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michael West</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">CEO</ENAMEX> who
had supervised the experiment, in debunking this "misinformation" (the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cow</ENAMEX>'s
genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> was never mixed with the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>) and deriding the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-bovine,
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">monsters</ENAMEX> drawn by editorial cartoonists as "science fiction." West
explained that he had used the cow egg only to "reprogram" the human cell,
making it "young again" and restoring its ability to "become any cell type."
The fake issue of mixing species thus obscured the genuine issue of
"reprogramming."

            The other
overhyped controversy that distracts ethicists from the real action is cloning.
The notion of replicating whole human beings transfixes biotech alarmists. This
concern, like <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> mixing, is easily dispelled. "We are not cloning human
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">beings</ENAMEX>," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">West</ENAMEX> testified at the hearing. Indeed, why manufacture whole people
when there's more money in the parts <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX>? The horror movie
scenario--cloning your whole <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>, freezing the clone, and "harvesting" its
liver and kidneys when you need them--diverts scrutiny from the real scenario:
"banking" your stem cells and growing them into new organs, including brain
tissue, a la <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">carte</ENAMEX>.

            
This erosion of the distinction between whole
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> and their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parts</ENAMEX>--<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">technicians</ENAMEX> will be able to tweak your cells either
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX>--brings into question the moral privileges we attribute to whole <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>,
such as personhood and bodily integrity. But no one broached these questions at
the hearing. Instead, as with abortion, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">panelists</ENAMEX> praised the new
techniques for solving the old questions. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Doerflinger</ENAMEX> happily argued that by
demonstrating other ways of deriving stem cells, the new experiments had proved
that the cloning of whole embryos could be banned, as <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catholic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX> have
proposed, without disrupting biotech research.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ethicists</ENAMEX> also have trouble
recognizing the new issues because they're trained to look for moral problems
in technology's costs, not in its benefits. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arthur Caplan</ENAMEX>, the only
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ethicist</ENAMEX> at the hearing who betrayed any awareness of the new issues, focused
instead on the morality of "trade-offs." "We should seek to achieve the most
good or benefit, with the least harm and destruction of things that we value,"
he argued. But the benefits of the new technologies--ultimately, immortality
and the rewriting of the recipe for human beings--are precisely what
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">philosophers</ENAMEX> ought to ponder. Where are we going? What are we becoming?

            The
immediate threat posed by the unraveling of the old physical and moral
distinctions--between human beings and human parts, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> and nonorganisms,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX>--is that private interests will come to own the stuff of
which we're made. As the hearing ended, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harkin</ENAMEX> expressed alarm that biotech
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> were claiming licenses and patents to human stem cells. He said this
concern had to do with the law, "not with ethical and moral implications." But
if ethics is relegated to peripheral and obsolete questions while industry
deconstructs, redesigns, and manufactures human components just like any other
commodity, laws that exempt these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">components</ENAMEX> from patenting, licensing, and
other property rights will lose their moral basis. And <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> who object that
human life is sacred won't have a leg to stand on.
