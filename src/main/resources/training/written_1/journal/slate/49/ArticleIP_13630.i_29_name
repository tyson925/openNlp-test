            Once upon a time there was
a densely populated island <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>, which, despite its lack of natural
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX>, had managed through hard work and ingenuity to build itself into one
of the world's major industrial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">powers</ENAMEX>. But there came a time when the magic
stopped working. A brief, overheated boom was followed by a slump that lingered
for most of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a decade</TIMEX>. A <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> whose name had once been a byword for economic
prowess instead became a symbol of faded glory.

            Inevitably, a dispute
raged over the causes of and cures for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s malaise. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observers</ENAMEX>
attributed the economy's decline to deep structural factors--<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX> that
failed to adapt to a changing world, missed opportunities to capitalize on new
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">technologies</ENAMEX>, and general rigidity and lack of flexibility. But a few
dissented. While conceding these factors were at work, they insisted that much
of the slump had far shallower roots--that it was the avoidable consequence of
an excessively conservative monetary policy, one preoccupied with conventional
standards of soundness when what the economy really needed was to roll the
printing presses.

            Needless to say, the "inflationists" were dismissed by
mainstream opinion. Adopting their proposals, argued central <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bankers</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">finance</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ministry</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>, would undermine confidence and hence worsen the
slump. And even if inflationary policies were to give the economy a false flush
of artificial health, they would be counterproductive in the long run because
they would relax the pressure for fundamental reform. Better to take the bitter
medicine now--to let unemployment rise, to force <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> to purge themselves
of redundant capacity--than to postpone <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> of reckoning.

            OK, OK, I've used this
writing trick before. The previous paragraphs could describe the current debate
about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>. (I myself am, of course, the most notorious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocate</ENAMEX> of inflation
as a cure for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>'s slump.) But they could also describe <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Great Britain</ENAMEX> in the
1920s--a point brought home to me by my vacation reading: the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> volume of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Skidelsky</ENAMEX>'s biography of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Maynard Keynes</ENAMEX>, which covers the crucial
period from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1920 to 1937</TIMEX>. (The volume's title, incidentally, is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">John</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maynard Keynes</ENAMEX>: 
               The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Economist as Savior</ENAMEX> .)

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Skidelsky</ENAMEX>'s book, believe it or not, is actually quite
absorbing: Although he was an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keynes</ENAMEX> led an interesting
life--though, to tell the truth, what I personally found myself envying was the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> he managed to change the world without having to visit quite so much of it.
(Imagine being a prominent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> without once experiencing jet lag, or
never taking a business trip where you spent more time getting to and from your
destination than you spent at it.) And anyone with an interest in the history
of economic thought will find the tale of how <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keynes</ENAMEX> gradually, painfully
arrived at his ideas--and of how his emerging vision clashed with rival schools
of thought--fascinating. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Click</ENAMEX> for an example.)

            But the part of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Skidelsky</ENAMEX>'s book that really resonates with current events concerns the great
debate over <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> monetary policy in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1920s</TIMEX>. Like the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> experienced an inflationary boom, fed by real estate speculation in
particular, immediately following <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">I.</ENAMEX> In both <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> this boom was
followed by a nasty recession. But whereas the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> soon recovered and
experienced <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a decade</TIMEX> of roaring prosperity before the coming of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Great</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Depression</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>'s slump never really ended. Unemployment, which had
averaged something like <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4 percent</NUMEX> before the war, stubbornly remained above <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
percent. There is an obvious parallel with modern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>, whose "bubble economy"
of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late 1980s</TIMEX> burst <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eight years ago</TIMEX> and has never bounced back.

            Almost everyone who thought about it agreed that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>'s
long-run relative decline as an economic power had much to do with structural
weaknesses: an overreliance on traditional industries such as coal and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">cotton</ENAMEX>,
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX>-ridden educational system that still tried to produce <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gentlemen</ENAMEX> rather
than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX>, a business culture that had failed to make the
transition from the family <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX> to the modern <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporation</ENAMEX>. (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keynes</ENAMEX>, never one
to mince words, wrote that "[t]he hereditary principle in the transmission of
wealth and the control of business is the reason why the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> of the
Capitalist cause is weak and stupid. It is too much dominated by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">third-generation</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>.") Similarly, everyone who thinks about it agrees that
modern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> has deep structural problems: a failure to move out of traditional
heavy industry, an educational system that stresses obedience rather than
initiative, a business system that insulates big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> from market
reality.

            But need structural
problems of this kind lead to high unemployment, as opposed to slow growth? Is
recession the price of inefficiency? <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keynes</ENAMEX> didn't think so then, and those of
us who think along related lines don't think so now. Recessions, we claim, can
and should be fought with short-run palliatives; by all means let us work on
our structural problems, but meanwhile let us also keep the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">work force</ENAMEX> employed
by printing enough money to keep <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> spending.

            One objection to that proposal is that it will directly do
more harm than good. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1920s</TIMEX> the great and the good believed that an
essential precondition for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> recovery was a return to the prewar gold
standard--at the prewar parity, that is, making a pound worth <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$4.86</NUMEX>. It was
believed that this goal was worth achieving even if it required a substantial
fall in wages and prices--that is, general deflation. To ratify the
depreciation of the pound that had taken place since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1914</TIMEX> in order to avoid
that deflation was clearly irresponsible.

            In modern times, of
course, it would, on the contrary, seem irresponsible to advocate deflation in
the name of a historical monetary benchmark (though <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> is currently
following a de facto policy of deflation in order to defend the fixed exchange
rate between its currency and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> dollar). But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">orthodoxy</ENAMEX> continues to
prevail against the logic of economic analysis. In the case of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>, there is
a compelling intellectual case for a recovery strategy based on the deliberate
creation of "managed inflation." But the great and the good know that
price stability is essential and that inflation is always a bad thing.

            What really struck me in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Skidelsky</ENAMEX>'s account, however, was
the extent to which conventional opinion in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1920s</TIMEX> viewed high unemployment
as a good thing, a sign that excesses were being corrected and
discipline restored--so that even a successful attempt to reflate the economy
would be a mistake. And one hears exactly the same argument now. As one
ordinarily sensible <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> said to me, "Your proposal would just
allow those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> to keep on doing the same old things, just when the recession
is finally bringing about change."

            In short, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>--and perhaps in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">States</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX>--behind many of the arguments about why we can't monetize our
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> out of a recession lies the belief that pain is good, that it builds a
stronger economy. Well, let <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keynes</ENAMEX> have the last word: "It is a grave criticism
of our way of managing our economic affairs, that this should seem to anyone
like a reasonable proposal."
