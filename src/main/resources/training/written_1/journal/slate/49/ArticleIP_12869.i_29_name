            The major premise of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pieter de Hooch</ENAMEX>
retrospective in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hartford</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Conn.</ENAMEX>, incredibly the first show ever to be devoted
to this <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">master</ENAMEX>, is that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Hooch</ENAMEX> is the supreme <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painter</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dutch</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">domesticity</ENAMEX>. "Most of his art expresses a clear moral point of view," writes
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Sutton</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wadsworth Atheneum</ENAMEX> and the world's leading
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">authority on de Hooch</ENAMEX>, "above all of the values of patriarchal <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> society
and their celebration of domestic virtue." <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sutton</ENAMEX> quotes liberally from the
"flood" of domestic conduct books of the period, including some rhymed couplets
from the wildly popular manual of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacob Cats</ENAMEX>, such as (in my translation): "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> obeys the law of the land; a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> obeys the will of her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>." Pictures
such as <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A Woman Nursing an Infant With a Child</ENAMEX> (circa <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1658-60</TIMEX>) are, in
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sutton</ENAMEX>'s view, compendiums of family values. The little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> feeding the dog is
practicing for the nurturing rituals of motherhood. The birdcage above the
contented <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> may well symbolize, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sutton</ENAMEX> suggests, the "sweet slavery
of marital love" (another proverb from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Cats</ENAMEX>).

            Little is known of his
life, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early or late</TIMEX>, and his pictures (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">37</NUMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wadsworth</ENAMEX> show, carefully
culled from a total of perhaps <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">170</NUMEX>) are the sole evidence of his
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">preoccupations</ENAMEX>. Born in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1629</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rotterdam</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Hooch</ENAMEX> apprenticed himself to a
Haarlem landscapist called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nicolaes Berchem</ENAMEX> before making his way to Delft
around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1652</TIMEX>. There he married and had several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> before changing his base
of operations to the burgeoning <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX>, where he died in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1684</TIMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">De Hooch</ENAMEX>'s paintings can be easily divided in subject and
style among his <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> geographical locales, as his own life ascended from
working <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> to middle class to high bourgeois. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Haarlem</ENAMEX>, he painted shadowy
lowlife scenes of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX> and barmaids carousing in vaguely rendered brothels
and dives. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Delft</ENAMEX>, his art snapped suddenly into focus, with a few figures
deployed in sunlit interiors or courtyards, their architectural surroundings
meticulously evoked with dazzling tricks of perspective. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX>, his
palette darkened; marble <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floors</ENAMEX> replaced earthenware tiles, satin supplanted
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">homespun</ENAMEX>, and a dream--it cannot have been more than that for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Hooch</ENAMEX>--of
luxury reigned.

            The short stay in Delft
resulted in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">de Hooch</ENAMEX>'s greatest paintings, and these dominate the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hartford</ENAMEX>
show. It was in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Delft</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Hooch</ENAMEX> mastered the expressive balance of
architectural setting and human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX>, as in his ambitious <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A Family</ENAMEX> in
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Courtyard</ENAMEX> (circa <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1657-60</TIMEX>). Visible through the arched entrance of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hartford</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">installation</ENAMEX>, the picture displays many of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Hooch</ENAMEX>'s signature
details: the ubiquitous <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX>, the bewilderingly complex perspective and, above
all, the recession down a corridor, often with a door ajar in the distance. In
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Swann's Way</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marcel Proust</ENAMEX> compared the little phrase of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">composer</ENAMEX>
Vinteuil, the "national anthem" of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Swann</ENAMEX>'s love for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Odette</ENAMEX>, to one of "those
interiors by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pieter de Hooch</ENAMEX> which are deepened by the narrow frame of a
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-opened door, in the far distance, of a different color, velvety with the
radiance of some intervening light."

            "Velvety radiance" actually sounds more like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jan Vermeer</ENAMEX>
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Swann</ENAMEX>'s obsession) than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Hooch</ENAMEX>, and the precise relationship between the two
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painters</ENAMEX> still elude <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX>. No document links them, but shared motifs (a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> weighing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX>, a trompe l'oeil curtain drawn just so) in their
paintings--especially from a magic moment around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1658</TIMEX>--suggest an intimacy akin
to such famous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partnerships</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vincent Van Gogh</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Gauguin</ENAMEX>, or Pablo
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Picasso</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Georges Braque</ENAMEX>. Current critical consensus is that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Hooch</ENAMEX> was the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">innovator</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vermeer</ENAMEX> the perfecter, while current taste (as evidenced by the
overwhelming attendance at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vermeer</ENAMEX> show in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three years ago</TIMEX>)
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">prefers Vermeer</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">De Hooch</ENAMEX> cannot match the sheer glamour of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vermeer</ENAMEX>, the
meditative inwardness of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vermeer</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, the pearly mystery of their moods as
they mull over love letters or listen to music.

            If we compare the two
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">painters on Vermeer</ENAMEX>'s terms--mystery, glamour, serenity, simplicity of
design--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Hooch</ENAMEX> is the inevitable loser. If we accept the view of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Hooch</ENAMEX>
advanced by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hartford</ENAMEX> show and catalog, as a propagandist for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> family
values, it's hard to explain the peculiar hold that his paintings have, or
ought to have, on us. I think the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hartford</ENAMEX> show overemphasizes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Hooch</ENAMEX>'s
praise of domesticity--clean tiles and contented <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX>--while underplaying
his alienation.

            Here's another way to look at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">de Hooch's</ENAMEX> pictures: Where
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vermeer</ENAMEX> is serene and transcendent, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Hooch</ENAMEX> is edgy and ill at ease. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">De Hooch</ENAMEX>,
in marked contrast to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vermeer</ENAMEX>, is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painter</ENAMEX> of this world, with all its social
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">precariousness</ENAMEX> and unavoidable melancholy. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vermeer</ENAMEX>'s single shaft of luminosity
from window or door evokes an otherworldly reality. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">De Hooch</ENAMEX> deploys several
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of light casting shadows every which way. His windows and doors relieve
the claustrophobia of his interiors, but they imply no other realm. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enigmatic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">figure</ENAMEX> with his back turned to us that we see down so many of de
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hooch</ENAMEX>'s recessions may suggest an escape route, but there's no promise that
where he's headed is any different from here.

            Once we're tuned to this
unsettling frequency in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">de Hooch</ENAMEX>'s work, we notice how many hints of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">confinement</ENAMEX> and escape there are in his work. All those birdcages may imply
something less comforting than love's "sweet slavery." The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> prowling
around, stand-ins perhaps for the observant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX>, give an unruliness to
family gatherings. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affectionately</ENAMEX> painted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">servants</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">de Hooch</ENAMEX>'s paintings,
such as the housemaid in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Woman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Child</ENAMEX> in an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Interior</ENAMEX> (circa <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1658</TIMEX>)
handing a mug of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beer</ENAMEX> to an elegantly clad little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX>, suggest an affinity with
the lower orders of society. During his <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> period, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Hooch</ENAMEX> includes
black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">servants</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">entertainers</ENAMEX> in his festive gatherings--another indication
of his sympathy for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> on the margins of society.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">De Hooch</ENAMEX> is at his most appealing when he is poking fun at
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> mania for cleanliness. In the wonderful <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A Woman Drinking with Two</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Men</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Serving Woman</ENAMEX> (circa <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1658</TIMEX>), carousers from his drab <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rotterdam</ENAMEX>
pictures have entered the finely nuanced space of his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delft</ENAMEX> interiors. A
slim-waisted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>, closely resembling the figure down the corridor in A
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Courtyard</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Delft</ENAMEX> , raises her cup to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>, one of whom pretends to play
a fiddle with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> pipes. Another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lovingly</ENAMEX> rendered serving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> stands by the
mantle, above which hangs a painting of the traditional theme of the education
of the Virgin. Not only does <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Hooch</ENAMEX> play with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> ways--secular and
sacred--of "educating <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">virgins</ENAMEX>," but he deliberately desecrates, with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">bits</NUMEX> of a
smashed pipe and rolling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>, that immaculate expanse of floor.

            After his move to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">de Hooch</ENAMEX> painted ever
more luxurious interiors, probably as bait for wealthy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patrons</ENAMEX>. He set several
pictures in the palatial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Amsterdam Town Hall</ENAMEX>, completed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1665</TIMEX> and regarded as
the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">eighth</NUMEX> wonder of the world. These pictures--including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> depicting a party
held, incongruously, in one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Town Hall</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chambers</ENAMEX>--have a dreamlike aura.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">De Hooch</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> addresses were in the poor outskirts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, outside
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> gates, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Town Hall</ENAMEX> may have been the only swanky interior he had
access to. At a time when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Holland</ENAMEX> was experiencing a surfeit of
prosperity--what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simon Schama</ENAMEX> calls its "embarrassment of riches"--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Hooch</ENAMEX> was
apparently left out in the cold. The last <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12 years</TIMEX> of his life are a blank. All
we know is that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pieter de Hooch</ENAMEX>, one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">masters</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> painting, was
buried in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cemetery</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX>, his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> having been carried directly from
the dolhuys , the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> for the insane.
