            In the movies, the past is
indeed a foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>; they dress differently there. The clothes on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>,
particularly, create foreignness in different ways. Depending on what era the
movie is set in, clothes can conjure a unfamiliarity that is soothingly
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adorable</ENAMEX> or uneasily alien. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Twenty years back</TIMEX>, and the gaze is nostalgic. But
go <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45 years back</TIMEX>, and the fashions cross into a mist that renders them faintly
dangerous--they are feared because their truth has finally been let go. Instead
of indulgence, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40-year-old</TIMEX> fashion seems to need taming. How else to explain
the way movies use ridicule and easy clich√©s when re-creating the clothes of
the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">1950s</NUMEX>?

            You can see how it works
in the recent movie <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Pleasantville</ENAMEX> , in which a pair of modern <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teens</ENAMEX> are
transported back <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45 years</TIMEX>--not into real life, but into a black-and-white
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Ozzie and Harriet</ENAMEX> -style TV sitcom. The movie's conceit is that sitcom
conventions of that time--no color, no sex, no <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bathrooms</ENAMEX>--delimit the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX>' reality. The extrademanding female underwear and extrasilly big
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">skirts</ENAMEX> also confirm our sense of the foreignness then, when painful situations
could be resolutely ignored and awkward facts kept under wraps while in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>'s clothes in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pleasantville</ENAMEX> , with all their ridiculous
exaggerations, show us a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> now alien indeed. They remind us that there
was a time when the line between the personal and the public was
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">impassable</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> leasantville suggests that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">'50s</ENAMEX> fashions for women
have now come to mean what female <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Victorian</ENAMEX> clothing used to mean in the
1920s--not just clothes in a different style, but a metaphor, a compendium of
ridiculous and unnatural devices invented to dishonor female life and liberty.
The actual clothes of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the '50s</TIMEX> are now <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost half</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a century</TIMEX> gone, most of them
vanished. We only see them in old films, old television, and old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazines</ENAMEX>,
just the way 1880s fashions were understood, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40 years later in the 1920s</TIMEX>, from
ancient fashion plates and daguerreotypes.

            The transition from the
1880s to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1920s</TIMEX> was severe. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the second half of the 1920s</TIMEX>, female fashion
and female life had been totally transformed. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Women</ENAMEX> had adopted short hair and
short skirts; they wore the easy-fitting sweaters and dresses appropriate for
modern female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX>, who by that time had acquired effective means of
contraception, gainful employment, and the vote. Too young to remember the
ordinary clothes of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the previous era</TIMEX>, they regarded huge bustles, sweeping
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">trains</ENAMEX>, lofty coiffures, and tightly laced waists with a ferocious derision
born of dread.

            Now, at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the 1990s</TIMEX>, with the evidence drawn
mainly from old movies and old sitcoms, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">'50s</TIMEX> fashion is similarly ripe for
reductive contempt. Those big, pointy breasts; useless hats; and lampshade
skirts look so creepy on the screen--and hardly a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> now alive can remember
what the great range of real clothing was like at the time.

            Yet this phenomenon
mysteriously rights itself the further we recede in time. Go back <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> more
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, and all our social perceptions become romantically transformed. Clothes
in historical movies can show the really distant past as a friendly foreign
land, perhaps even a lot like the here and now. All <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ancient Historical Drag</ENAMEX> is
morally and visually neutral, apt for inventive play with the styles of a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">century</ENAMEX> back, or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five centuries</TIMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">20</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Victorian</ENAMEX> fashion, for example, wholly
redeemed, is often treated with great respect in movies such as <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Portrait</ENAMEX>
of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lady</ENAMEX> . The high hair and big bustles have been assimilated to all the
other harmless customs of antiquity; they've become the equivalent of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Egyptian</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">breastplates</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Elizabethan</ENAMEX> padding.

            Historical films are usually kind to the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">olden days</TIMEX>,
updating the principal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>'s clothes so the actresses look attractive by
modern standards. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> recent releases deal with the Elizabethan
age-- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elizabeth</ENAMEX> , the bloody tale of the Virgin Queen's rise, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare in Love</ENAMEX> , a romp through <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Elizabethan</ENAMEX> theater. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> shows
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late 16 th century</TIMEX> fashion looking ridiculous only on the aging queen
herself, as if no other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> at the time ever wore a rigid farthingale and
stuffed sleeves, a tightly frizzed wig and a bushel of pearls, or painted her
face with white paste. The young court <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ladies</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Elizabeth</ENAMEX> appear in
their natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hair</ENAMEX> and skin, wearing modern-looking Renaissancey garments that
run to becomingly <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mobile</ENAMEX> and flowing silk dresses with smoothly boned bodices.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare in Love</ENAMEX> has authentic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Elizabethan</ENAMEX> dress for everybody, but
there's a good deal of extra emphasis on the way the period corsets flatten the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">breasts</ENAMEX> and strictly encase the ribs--and on how thrilling it is when the
corsets come off. In <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">'50s</TIMEX> movies set in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Elizabethan</ENAMEX> times, of course, everybody
wore big, molded, and pointy breasts with their Renaissancey garb--no
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">flattening</ENAMEX> was permitted and certainly no exposure.

            Even though corseted
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> are authentically <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elizabethan</ENAMEX>, they are used so freely in both these
films because they're modish once more. Modern <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designers</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Christian</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lacroix</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Galliano</ENAMEX>--and especially <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jean-Paul Gaultier</ENAMEX>--<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">overthrew</NUMEX> '60s
ideology to reinstate the corset, using them as sexy accents in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early '90s</TIMEX>.
Such recent use has decisively transformed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the standard 20 th century</TIMEX>
emblem of female oppression back into the erotic device it always was.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corseting</ENAMEX> has stopped looking dishonorable and started looking chic again, both
as a feature of recent ball gowns and wedding gowns and as a costume component
that can give a modern frisson to movies set in ancient <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">'50s</ENAMEX> aren't quite ancient yet, but they're getting more
so. By contrast to the condescension of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pleasantville</ENAMEX> , genuine
tenderness for the time could be seen in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Last Picture Show</ENAMEX> , a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1971</TIMEX>
film about real life in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1951</TIMEX>. Nostalgia could still be evoked after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 20</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, and many remembered when. The movie was beautifully restrained and
accurate with respect to clothing--the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peasant blouses</ENAMEX>, the swinging skirts,
the smooth, side-parted hair, the garter belts and capacious underpants from a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> before spandex were all deliciously heartbreaking, never exaggerated for
laughs. The film's evocation of the style of the time was marred only by
insufficient attention to movement. The young jeans-wearing actresses of the
'70s failed to walk in the correct '50s style while wearing long narrow skirts.
(The secret: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Knees</ENAMEX> together, and don't try to stride.)

            Today, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the '90s</TIMEX>,
right on schedule, fashions of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the '70s</TIMEX> are being given a nostalgic,
sympathetically accurate whirl in such movies as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hilary</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackie</ENAMEX> and
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ice Storm</ENAMEX> . A genial gaze is being cast on them just as flared
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">trousers</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">square-toed</NUMEX> shoes, and long male hair are once again looking normal
in the real-life fashion universe. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">another 20 years</TIMEX>, no doubt, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">'70s</TIMEX> fashion
will be in for its share of cinematic contempt (once the square toes are truly
gone) just as the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">'50s</NUMEX> finally achieve true antiquity.

            The modes of any period can easily be made to look stupid.
Even in its own day, fashion needs a lot of enhancement to make it look great.
Whereas fashion photography--in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the '50s</TIMEX> as always--aimed to arouse active lust
for new goods, the clothes in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">'50s</TIMEX> movies were so thoroughly surreal as to look
quite unfit for normal wear, even if they were waitresses' uniforms or
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX>-next-door dresses. Movie <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">garb</ENAMEX> was automatically read as part of the
tradition that stretched back to silent <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>, with everything made
specially for the stars and uniquely worn by them. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cat</ENAMEX> on a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hot Tin</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roof</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designers</ENAMEX> fit <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elizabeth Taylor</ENAMEX> into a form-fitting,
made-to-measure, boned-and-stayed, built-in-bra sort of slip, unobtainable by
anybody else, an inspired collaboration between <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Taylor</ENAMEX>'s unbelievable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> and
the costume <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX>. Real '50s slips had no relation to it at all. They were
like the ones in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Last Picture Show</ENAMEX> , with wrinkles around the middle
and unreliable straps that slid around on the shoulders, uneasily contending
with the bra straps. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the '50s</TIMEX>, nobody wanted the movies to show all that
except for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> ones, where the sexiest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> all wore ill-fitting slips
and had hairy armpits, too. That was really foreign.

            But equally strange was
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Doris Day</ENAMEX>, whose many movie <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outfits</ENAMEX> were conceived as musical-comedy
costumes--bright, smooth, and jaunty, every blue and yellow clear and true,
every neat hat perfectly matching, and every outline eternally crisp--even if
she was supposed to be working in an office or teaching in a journalism <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>.
Nobody ever wanted to emulate this effect; it was hers alone.

            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> we cede our vision of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">'50s</NUMEX> female fashion to the
movie version, as if that were the real mirror of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the decade</TIMEX>--everything
blatantly cleansed of error, willfully idealized into unreality, odorless,
effortless, affectless. Those excruciatingly clean-cut and perfectly clad
cinematic female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> can seem to suggest a world unwilling to acknowledge
the existence of adultery, homosexuality, racial strife, female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lust</ENAMEX> and rage,
political and cultural revolution, family dysfunction, or messy passion of any
kind, not to mention irreparable loss, unbearable pain, and death.

            In fact, many '50s movies were about all these
things and more, the most intractable aspects of human life. But they were
always careful to suggest that none of that could affect the time-honored
conventions for the cinematic female wardrobe. Those conventions had an
important meaning at the time. They stood for the notion that private life was
private.
