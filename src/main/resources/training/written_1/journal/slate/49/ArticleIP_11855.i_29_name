Wrap-Up
            

            In this <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Christmas season</TIMEX>, when tasty sweaters
and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">snuggly cheeses</ENAMEX> are on everyone's gift list, it's traditional to reflect on
where it all began. That's why, at our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>, I read aloud from that holiday
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">classic</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eric Foner</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Story of American Freedom</ENAMEX> . The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> throw
another <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">SimuLog</ENAMEX> on the fire, and I tell them about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1950s</TIMEX> when, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Foner</ENAMEX> says,
the noble ideas of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Revolution</ENAMEX> at last evolved from old-fashioned
political freedom to the modern freedom to shop in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mall</ENAMEX> of your choice.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Foner</ENAMEX> quotes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Lilienthal</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atomic Energy Commission</ENAMEX> who, in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1952</TIMEX>, wrote: "By freedom, I mean essentially freedom to choose to the maximum
degree possible. It means a maximum range of choice for the consumer when he
spends his dollar." Here was an idea <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intellectuals</ENAMEX> might also embrace.
"Industrial society," wrote <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clark Kerr</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">California at Berkeley</ENAMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1960</TIMEX>, "might undermine freedom 'in the workplace,'
but the compensation was the greater range of 'alternatives in goods and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">services</ENAMEX>,' and thus 'a greater scope of freedom' in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>' 'personal
lives.' "

            Then we all go outside
for a look at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the holiday</TIMEX> figures arranged on the front lawn--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Khrushchev</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX>, the floor-sweeping robot--why, you'd almost believe you were back in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moscow</ENAMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1959</TIMEX>, at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American National Exhibition</ENAMEX>. There, in the model
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen</ENAMEX> of a suburban <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ranch house</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX> proclaimed the true
spirit of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>, what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Foner</ENAMEX> sums up as "freedom of choice among colors,
styles, and prices." God bless us, every sweater!

Answer
            

            These are among the items
on which the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> will impose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100 percent</NUMEX> tariffs unless the European
Union opens its market to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bananas</ENAMEX> shipped by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chiquita</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dole</ENAMEX>. While the
banana sanctions violate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Trade Organization</ENAMEX> rules, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> vigor in this
matter seems to derive from the hefty contributions <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chiquita</ENAMEX>'s major
shareholder, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carl Linder</ENAMEX>, makes to both political <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX>. Referring to the
paucity of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>-grown <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bananas</ENAMEX>, former <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Trade Representative</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mickey Kantor</ENAMEX>
noted, "If you drive north on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pacific Coast Highway</ENAMEX>, I think there's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
acres of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bananas</ENAMEX> on the right-hand side."

            It's a wonderful magical
land, and it's not on any map: You must find it in your heart or on your
television. But who are the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who live there? Answer these questions based
on a just released study of prime-time network TV conducted by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Gerbner</ENAMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple University</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Screen Actors Guild</ENAMEX> and noticed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adam Bonin</ENAMEX>.

            
               Questions
            

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. What demographic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> is portrayed as most

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. What is the most underrepresented <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>?

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Characters</ENAMEX> portrayed as suffering from mental
<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX> are depicted as the most dangerous of demographic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60%</NUMEX>
shown to be involved in crime or violence (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times the actual rate)."

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Foreigners</ENAMEX>. And they don't do so well as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX>,
either. "A disproportionate number of ill-fated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> comes from the ranks
of poor, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Latino</ENAMEX> and foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>, and both young and old <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African-American</ENAMEX> and
poor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>."

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanics</ENAMEX> appear on <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">prime-time</TIMEX> TV at about
one-quarter their rate in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.6 percent</NUMEX> vs. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10.7 percent</NUMEX>.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. They begin
disappearing: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nine</ENAMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> on television are <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">under age 46</TIMEX>. And they
turn to crime. "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Women</ENAMEX> age faster than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>, and as they age, they become more
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">evil</ENAMEX>."
