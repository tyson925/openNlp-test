Goes Free
            

            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Almost a year ago</TIMEX>,

                  Slate
                began charging a subscription fee for access to most of our
contents and services. Effective <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, all current editorial content will be
free. E-mail deliveries, our <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekly</TIMEX> print-out edition, "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Fray</ENAMEX>," and "The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Compost</ENAMEX>" (the 
                  Slate
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">archive</ENAMEX>) will still be available to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subscribers</ENAMEX> only, and we will be adding new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subscriber</ENAMEX> benefits. Current
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subscribers</ENAMEX> will get a special offer for continuing under the new arrangement.
If you're not satisfied with it, we will happily refund the balance of your
subscription. Well, happily is an exaggeration. But we do appreciate the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX> who've put their <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$19.95</NUMEX> on the line, and we don't want anyone to feel
cheated or abused by this new subscription policy.

QUESTIONS
            

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Q</ENAMEX>: "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">New subscription policy" my Aunt Sally</ENAMEX>.
Who are you trying to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX>? You're obviously backing down.
            

            A: No, no, you see
there's always been a mix of free and paid stuff ... we're just
changing the mix ... OK, OK, sure: We're backing down.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Q</ENAMEX>: Why?
            

            A: In a nutshell, it now
looks as if it's going to be easier to sell ads but harder to sell
subscriptions than we thought <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year ago</TIMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Ten</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> visit our free areas
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every month</TIMEX> for each one paying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subscriber</ENAMEX>. (That's counting a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> just once
no matter how often he or she visits.) It's painful to think of turning away so
many 
                  Slate
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> from so much of our content--not to mention
the potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> who don't come in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> place. The spreadsheet
wizards figure that ad revenue from the increased traffic will more than
compensate for the lost subscriptions.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Q: Well</ENAMEX>, duh! Everybody said you
can't charge for content on the Internet. Information wants to be free! Unless
it's about sex or stocks. But oh no, you knew better. You'd show the world.
You'd charge for news digests, for political analysis, for cultural
discussions, for poetry <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">f'r Chrissake</ENAMEX>. Don't you feel like
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">jerks</ENAMEX>?
            

            A: Not really. OK, maybe
a bit. But look: This is terra incognita. We never claimed to have found the
one true path. We tried one thing, now we're trying something else, and we'll
keep trying until we figure it out. Although we are owned by a rich <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>,
becoming financially self-sustaining remains a crucial goal. And it's not as if
anyone else has figured it out either. Let him or her with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Webzine</ENAMEX> that's
breaking even cast the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stone</ENAMEX>. (And "going to break even <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</TIMEX>"
doesn't count. Every money-losing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> in history is going to break even
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</TIMEX>.)

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Q</ENAMEX>: But clearly, at least in hindsight, you
got something wrong. What was it?
            

            Clearly, yes. It may just have been that we were too
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early</TIMEX>. There is too much free stuff out there, the process of paying and
accessing what you paid for is too clumsy and unfamiliar, and so on. Some of
this may change. But we also may have missed a couple of more fundamental
truths about the Web. One concerns <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concerns advertisers</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Web</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> surf . They go quickly from site
to site. If they really like a particular site, they may visit it often, but
they are unlikely to devote a continuous <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">half-hour</TIMEX> or more to any one site the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> you might read a traditional paper <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> sitting. This appears to
be in the nature of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Web</ENAMEX> and not something that is likely to change. And it
makes paying for access to any particular site a bigger practical and
psychological hurdle.

            Web <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">advertisers</ENAMEX>, meanwhile, don't seem to place any
special value on reaching paying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subscribers</ENAMEX>. That was a bit surprising, since
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">traditional</ENAMEX> magazine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">advertisers</ENAMEX> usually require paying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subscribers</ENAMEX>.
Even profitable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazines</ENAMEX> often spend more money finding and signing up
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subscribers</ENAMEX> than those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subscribers</ENAMEX> will ever pay. But if they just gave the
magazine away, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">advertisers</ENAMEX> would lose interest.

            Why doesn't this apply on
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Web</ENAMEX>? Probably because Web <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">advertisers</ENAMEX> pay on the basis of ads served. If
you buy an ad in a print <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> with a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500,000</NUMEX> circulation, you have no way
of knowing how many of those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> actually saw your ad. But if they paid for
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX>, you at least have some assurance that they picked it up. On the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Web</ENAMEX>, that assurance is unnecessary. If you buy <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500,000</NUMEX> ad <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">impressions</ENAMEX> on

                  Slate
               , you know that your ad has been put on someone's computer
screen <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500,000</NUMEX> times. This is a great selling point for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Web</ENAMEX> advertising, but it
radically changes the economics of charging for subscriptions.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Q</ENAMEX>: Isn't this change a sign that you're
getting desperate, that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> is losing interest, that you're about to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fold</ENAMEX>, that the end is nigh, strange and dreadful <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> are about to ravage
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, the stock market is going to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tank</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Linda Tripp</ENAMEX> will get her own
TV talk show, and so on?
            

            A: For heaven's sake,
you made the same sort of dire predictions when we started charging for
content <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year ago</TIMEX>. We have had nothing but support from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>, both in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">general</ENAMEX> and for every stage of our ongoing experiment. One benefit of making
our current content free is that 
                  Slate
                will be able to
participate more fully in the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> "portal" site, msn.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">com</ENAMEX>.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Q</ENAMEX>: Do you promise this is the last big
change in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate</ENAMEX> that you'll put us through?
            

            A: Absolutely not. This
is an adventure. Thanks for joining us on it.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Q</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">One</ENAMEX> final question. What does <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill</ENAMEX> have
to say about this?
            

            A: It's true we approached the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">CEO</ENAMEX> with some
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">trepidation</ENAMEX>, and his initial reaction was not encouraging. He turned to his
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">guard dogs</ENAMEX> and said, "Neukom! Herbold! Kill!" But then he said, "Wait. What
will happen to that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Emily Yoffe</ENAMEX> who writes the column about the tabloids<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">?</ENAMEX>"
She'll get many new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX>, we explained. "And 'Dear <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudence</ENAMEX>,' and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edelstein</ENAMEX>'s movie reviews, and all those e-mail back-and-forths?" <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ditto</ENAMEX>, ditto,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ditto</ENAMEX>, we replied.

            "OK," he said, turning to his canine
physiotherapist, "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ballmer</ENAMEX>, call off the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX>. Give them some print <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> to
eat instead. They just love the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Economist</ENAMEX> ."
