            Let's give <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">President</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinton</ENAMEX> credit for attempting, in this darkest <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hour</TIMEX> of his presidency, to
revive a worthwhile if unpopular idea: stronger federal control over the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nation</ENAMEX>'s public <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State of</ENAMEX>
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Union</ENAMEX> proposal to semi-privatize <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> may be getting most of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">press</ENAMEX>, but his plan to penalize <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> with the loss of federal education
dollars if they fail to enforce strict academic standards was by far the most
interesting policy initiative unveiled in his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> speech. If <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> sticks
to his rhetorical <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX> (and hangs onto his job), it could become one of the
most important initiatives of his presidency. If he doesn't, or if the bill
fails to clear a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> that's sure to be hostile to it, it will rank with
the health care bill as one of the more significant policy disappointments of
his presidency.

            The proposal reaches the table at a time when education
reform has all but disappeared from the national political agenda. Remember
education reform? Back in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1983</TIMEX>, a blue-ribbon <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> on elementary and
high-school education declared "the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> at risk," and in response states
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">legislated</ENAMEX> reforms such as merit pay to boost <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> performance. The cry for
better public <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> reached a crescendo in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Bush</ENAMEX>, the
"education <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>," convened an education summit in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Charlottesville</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Va.</ENAMEX>,
which defined national education goals to be reached by the Year <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>,
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more</NUMEX> reform-minded <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governors</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Charlottesville</ENAMEX> conference,
tried to establish national standards to help achieve the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Charlottesville</ENAMEX> goals
when he became <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>-authored grant program inspired by the
conference did become law in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX>. But the standard-setting portion was watered
down by congressional <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> who perceived it as a liberal plot to create
a national <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> of education, and by some congressional <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX> who saw
tougher school standards as a threat to the self-esteem of black and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanic</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>. It was all but gutted after <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> took over <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>.
(A special place in hell should be reserved for perpetual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Republican</ENAMEX>
presidential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lamar Alexander</ENAMEX>, who as education <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX> during the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> promoted national standards only to oppose them when they
were put forth by a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democratic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>.)

            Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past few years</TIMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">education</ENAMEX> has receded as a subject of national <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX>. A large part of the
impetus behind the education reform movement had been panic over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
competitiveness in the international economy. Today, of course, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
position in the world economy is very strong. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lester Thurow</ENAMEX>
recently observed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">as recently as 1990</TIMEX> the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX> had only one of the world's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> most valuable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>. Last
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>, it had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX>. Unfortunately, the resurgence of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> economic dominance
(much of which has less to do with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> might than with financial turmoil
in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX>) was not accompanied by much improvement in the performance of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Education Week</ENAMEX> recently pronounced the chances were
"practically nil" that the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Charlottesville</ENAMEX> goals would be met by the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">target year of 2000</TIMEX>. An accompanying chart shows that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 percent</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX>-
and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">eighth</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">-graders</ENAMEX> met the goals <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>'s performance standard in reading in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>, only one statistically insignificant percentage point greater than in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX>; for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">th -graders</ENAMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">36 percent</NUMEX> who met the performance
standard was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> percentage points less than in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX>. Math achievement
did show significant improvement, especially for <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX>- and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">eighth</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">-graders</ENAMEX>,
but <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three-quarters of the fourth-</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eighth</NUMEX>-, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">th -graders</ENAMEX>
surveyed continued not to meet the goals <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>'s math performance standard.
High-school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">seniors</ENAMEX> were bested by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> surveyed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> on math
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">achievement</ENAMEX>, and by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> on science achievement.

            The outlines of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s education proposal are still a
bit vague. They will be sketched in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later this year</TIMEX>, when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">drafts</TIMEX> reauthorization language for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Elementary and Secondary Education Act</ENAMEX>.
But at least as conceived at the moment, the plan is to empower the federal
government to withhold funds to state education <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">administrators</ENAMEX>--<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">roughly 1</NUMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">percent to 2 percent</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$11 billion</NUMEX> that the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> spends
annually on public elementary, junior high, and high <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> through this
law--if the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> are not taking steps to end certain harmful
practices. (If the feds got really mad, they could also withhold the actual
funds that go to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>, although that is an unlikely "last resort," according
to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gerald Tirozzi</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assistant secretary</ENAMEX> for elementary and secondary education.)
Among these practices are "social promotion," whereby unqualified <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> are
kicked up to the next grade level; persistent low academic performance; poor
discipline; and the assignment of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> for which they are
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">unqualified</ENAMEX>. (This last, aimed mainly at eliminating the issuing of "emergency"
teaching certificates, appears to be a concession to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unions</ENAMEX>, but
it will be accompanied by stricter requirements for testing new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX>.) The
plan also requires <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> to issue, in addition to report cards on individual
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>' performance, report cards on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>'s overall academic
performance.

            Howls of protest about
the plan's usurpation of local prerogatives have already begun. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chester Finn</ENAMEX>, a
senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fellow</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manhattan Institute</ENAMEX>, who formerly worked in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Education</ENAMEX>, and who is sympathetic to many of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s
goals, insists, "The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> are the constitutional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> in education."
Such complaints already seem to have cowed the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>. At a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX> briefing on the plan <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier this week</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House Domestic Policy</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Council</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce Reed</ENAMEX> said, "I think the headline <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> for the New
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">York Times</ENAMEX> got it wrong--we're not for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> control, we're for state and
local control." Actually, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> headline, one hopes, got it right:
"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Clinton To Urge More U.S. Control on Aid to Schools</ENAMEX>." Given that the aid in
question comes from the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> to begin with--and, when combined
with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $9 billion</NUMEX> in additional federal spending, accounts for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 6</NUMEX>
percent of all money spent on public education from kindergarten through
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">12 th</NUMEX> grade--doesn't the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> have a
responsibility to make sure the money is well spent? Any state bent on
keeping its "constitutional authority" unmolested is always free to buy back
its sovereignty by refusing federal education aid.

            In fact, the whole notion that education should be purely a
local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> has long reflected Jeffersonian nostalgia more than it has
reality. As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nicholas Lemann</ENAMEX> observed in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atlantic Monthly</ENAMEX> ,
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> public <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> are "rhetorically committed to decentralization" but in
fact are "centralized in a patchwork, undeliberate way. We have national
standardized tests, national <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unions</ENAMEX>, national textbook <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publishers</ENAMEX>,
and national laws, regulations, and funding programs for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>." And also, he
might well have pointed out, a national economy: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jobs</ENAMEX> are not parceled out
equally according to school districts. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> being educated in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mississippi</ENAMEX>
needs to be educated sufficiently to allow him to prosper in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Jersey</ENAMEX>,
or wherever his future employment may be. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandra Feldman</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Federation of Teachers</ENAMEX>, which has lent its support to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s plan,
says, "There has been too great a difference between school districts and
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>."

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Will Clinton</ENAMEX>'s plan be radical enough to have much
effect? As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Finn</ENAMEX> rightly points out, a similar but narrower penalty provision in
the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX> reauthorization of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Elementary and Secondary Education Act</ENAMEX> has
never been used; although some <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> have received warnings, none has lost
funds, as is permitted under the law. There's some real danger that cosmetic
reforms at the state level--more programs, no results--will be enough to stave
off penalties under the new law. Like most major education reforms in recent
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, this one eschews testing of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> who are already on the job as the
price for union support of testing for new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Finn</ENAMEX> may be right when he
argues that "to say we're only going to deal with the new ones is to say we'll
solve the problem <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20 years from now</TIMEX>." (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Feldman</ENAMEX> counters that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two-thirds</NUMEX> of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nation's</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> will be retiring during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next decade</TIMEX>.) Another
cause for disappointment is that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> plan will not impose a national
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">curriculum</ENAMEX>, which, regrettably, remains beyond the pale in any practical
discussion about education reform because of the ongoing culture wars among
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fundamentalists</ENAMEX>, mainstream <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">educators</ENAMEX>, and multicultural
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">leftists</ENAMEX>.

            Still, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bully</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hail Mary</ENAMEX> pass, if that's
what he intends it to be. As a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lame-duck president</ENAMEX> who'll count himself lucky
to inhabit the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oval Office</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two more years</TIMEX>, this is no time to play it
safe.
