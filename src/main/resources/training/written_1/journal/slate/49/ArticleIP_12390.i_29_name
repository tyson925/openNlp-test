            Is it possible to write
in rhyme and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">meter</NUMEX> more gracefully and plainly than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ben Jonson</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1573-1637</TIMEX>) does
in "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">His Excuse for Loving"</ENAMEX>? In couplets and the "beheaded" (<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> syllable
omitted) <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">four-foot</NUMEX> iambic line, familiar from "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Twinkle</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Twinkle</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Little Star</ENAMEX>,"
he speaks his mind directly and eloquently about feeling love ardently when no
longer a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youth</ENAMEX>. The closing lines of the poem, with the sentence dancing
eagerly over and across the ends of the lines, suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Butler</ENAMEX>
Yeats read <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jonson</ENAMEX> closely--and indeed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeats</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ezra Pound</ENAMEX> did study Jonson
during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the months</TIMEX> when they shared a cottage in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>.

            
               --<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Robert</ENAMEX>
Pinsky
            

            Let it
not your wonder move,
Less your laughter, that I love.
Though I now write <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fifty years</TIMEX>,
I have had, and have my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Peeres</ENAMEX>;
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Poets</ENAMEX>, though divine are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>:
Some have loved as old again.
And it is not always face,
Clothes, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fortune</ENAMEX> gives the grace;
Or the feature, or the youth:
But the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Language</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Truth</ENAMEX>,
With the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Ardor, and the Passion</ENAMEX>,
Gives the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lover</ENAMEX> weight, and fashion.
If you then will read the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Storie</ENAMEX>,
First, prepare you to be sorry
That you never knew till now,
Either whom to love, or how:
But be glad, as soon with me,
When you know, that this is she,
Of whose <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beautie</ENAMEX> it was sung,
She shall make the old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> young,
Keepe the middle age at stay,
And let nothing high decay,
Till she be the reason why,
All the world for love may die.
