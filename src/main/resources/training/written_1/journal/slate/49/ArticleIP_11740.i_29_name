            If you have a job like
mine, in which a reasonably broad swath of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> society presents itself to
you without any clothes on, this question no doubt has popped into your head:
Why are the poor so fat? That obesity is a characteristic problem of affluent
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> surprises no one. But why is it also characteristic that obesity
increases so dramatically as you go down the social scale?

            This, of course, is not
the case in developing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nations</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>, where my parents
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">emigrated from</ENAMEX>, being overweight is directly related to wealth and status and
is regarded as attractive. Thus, my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>'s rural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX> is thin
and wiry, while the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elders</ENAMEX> in my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>'s urban <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clan</ENAMEX> of higher caste and
wealthier stock are as plump as can be. When my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> and I, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> scrawny
specimens of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> "upper-middle <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX>," visit, we always evoke a good
deal of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX>.

            The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> report I found to document the effect class has
on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">obesity</ENAMEX> was a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1965</TIMEX> study of midtown <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manhattan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX>
found obesity was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> times more common among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> in the bottom <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">social</ENAMEX> scale than among those in the top <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX>. Subsequent studies, orginating
from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Zealand</ENAMEX>, confirm these findings. In a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> study in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Minnesota's Twin Cities</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> earning <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">under $10,000</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> weighed, on
average, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20 pounds</NUMEX> more than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> earning <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">over $40,000</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX>. In advanced
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nations</ENAMEX>, low income is a more powerful predictor of obesity than any single
factor except age, though this relationship is weaker in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> than in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. In
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>, height is associated more strongly with status. On average, in developed
and undeveloped <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> alike, richer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> are taller.

            You'd think weight would be like height. More money
means more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX>. So more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> should mean more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fat</ENAMEX>, just as it means more
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">height</ENAMEX>, right? And, in fact, in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> this is exactly the case--at young
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ages</ENAMEX>, certainly <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">under age 6</TIMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, lower-income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> are less
likely to be obese than higher-income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>. By the time they are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>,
however, the relationship has inverted.

            What's going on? As my
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">epidemiologist friends</ENAMEX> point out to me, when <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> things correlate, there are
always <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> possible explanations. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> leads to the other. The other leads to
the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>. Or some <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> thing is driving both.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> he downward mobility hypothesis. One
possibility is that obesity leads to lower income. Certainly the obese,
particularly obese <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, face severe disadvantages in both the job and
marriage markets. And the evidence that this produces downward mobility is
distressingly strong. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Almost half</NUMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1965</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manhattan</ENAMEX> study
belonged to a different social class than their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>, and those who had
moved down were significantly fatter than those who had moved up. More
recently, a landmark national study led by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven Gortmaker</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researcher</ENAMEX>, tracked <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 8,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 18 to 25</TIMEX>. It found the heaviest
<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 percent</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> as likely to get married and twice as likely to
become impoverished as others. Obesity affected a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>'s economic prospects
more than even chronic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>, however, shortness led to downward
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mobility</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> foot less of height doubled a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>'s likelihood of poverty. But as
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Gortmaker</NUMEX> points out, downward mobility explains only a small part of the
observed relationship of income to obesity. That makes sense. After all, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gap</ENAMEX> also exists in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>, where social class is more rigid
than it is here.

            

               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>
               he genetic explanation. Could genetics be an
outside factor driving both obesity and poverty? The so-called "<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Danish</ENAMEX> adoption
study" lent some credence to the idea, finding that the obesity and social
status of adoptees depended on the social status not only of their adoptive
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> but also of their biological <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>. The study inferred that parents
can give their offspring genetic traits that tip the scales toward both heavier
weight and lower status. Even so, inheritance accounted for at most a small
part of the stark effect of income on obesity.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> he gluttony and sloth hypothesis. So downward
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mobility</ENAMEX> and genes matter somewhat but, ultimately, we're left with the obvious
explanation that in affluent societies the lower the income, the more people
eat unhealthily, sit around, or both. Unfortunately, measuring this directly is
notoriously difficult. Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>--especially the obese--fib about diet and
exercise and, when observed, tend to change their behavior. The differences
you're looking for are also quite small--a single calorie of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">extra</NUMEX> daily intake
starting in childhood can translate into <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 extra pounds</NUMEX> by the time you're 25.
Nonetheless, there's a good deal of indirect evidence--for example, TV watching
is linked to eating more and exercising less, and rises substantially as income
lowers. Given the weakness of other explanations, few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> doubt that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lifestyle</ENAMEX> is the most important one.

            The question is why. It's
as if avoiding obesity were enormously expensive. But it's not--exercise is
free, and eating less junk food and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meat</ENAMEX> and more produce saves money. Rather,
for the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 percent to 70 percent</NUMEX> with a genetic predisposition to obesity, it's
just horrendously difficult. Being motivated is vital, and motivation is what
seems to differ by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX>.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">1996 Twin Cities</ENAMEX> study, for example, found marked
differences in weight <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX>. Although <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> earning <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">under $10,000</NUMEX> were no
less successful when they dieted than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> earning <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">over $40,000</NUMEX>, they were
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one-third</NUMEX> less likely to diet in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> place. They had a greater tolerance
for weight gain, saying it would take a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20 pound</NUMEX> gain before they took action,
as opposed to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> pound gain that would trigger action in higher-income
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. They even weighed themselves less often (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a month</TIMEX> vs. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX>
times <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a month</TIMEX>).

            This cultural-differences explanation certainly
accounts for why anorexia nervosa is mainly a disease of higher-income girls
and young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. Since obese <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> are less stigmatized, it may also explain why
wealthier <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> are not that much less obese than poorer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>.

            Still, if thinness really becomes the ideal in
every affluent culture--the way plumpness is in poor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">societies</ENAMEX>--it's curious.
Is this simply the nature of status--the rich will always find a way to
distinguish themselves from the poor? Or does richness breed an instinct for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">longevity</ENAMEX>? Whatever the case, I'll know <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> has finally risen from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Third</ENAMEX>
World status when I go back to visit my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX> and the first few words they
say are not "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eat</ENAMEX>, eat, skinny <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX>."
