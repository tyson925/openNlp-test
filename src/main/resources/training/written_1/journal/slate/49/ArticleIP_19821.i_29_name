            The majority of newspapers
around the world disapproved of the impeachment trial of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> and
hoped for his acquittal. The exception was the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> press, which divided
along predictably partisan lines. Following the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> votes, the conservative
Daily
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Telegraph</ENAMEX> said, "a decent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> would have resigned when his public lying
had been revealed," whereas "Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> hung on, correctly calculating that a
mixture of brazenness, legal equivocation and personal charm would see him
through." But the paper pronounced him "the lamest of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ducks</ENAMEX>," which, it said,
is "a loss not only to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>, but also to their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> around the
world."

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times of London</ENAMEX>, another
anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> paper, splashed the headline "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Great Escape</ENAMEX>" across
its front page and said in an editorial (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">"Suspended Sentence"</ENAMEX>) that a "revival
in Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s standing can only be achieved through foreign policy," which
will require a huge investment of his time for uncertain returns. "Some
[foreign policy initiatives] would invite internal opposition and risk damaging
his precious poll numbers," the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> said. "That should not be an
excuse for inaction. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Greenspan</ENAMEX>'s financial decisions have been the making
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> presidency. It is time that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chief Executive</ENAMEX> made rather more
of his presidency himself."

            In an editorial it called "The end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zipper</ENAMEX>," the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">liberal Guardian</ENAMEX> said one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">losers</ENAMEX> in the scandal was the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX>, which constantly predicted a national mood swing against the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>, when none was there. "They also compromised some of their own most
cherished ethical standards, a mistake they may live to regret," the editorial
said. It acknowledged, however, that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stars</ENAMEX>" of the affair had emerged
with credit: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monica Lewinsky</ENAMEX> "who showed some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> in her testimony ... and
who refused to surrender to the bullying of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witchfinder-general</ENAMEX>";
the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">U.S. Constitution</ENAMEX>, which "showed it is robust enough to survive even the
madness of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1990s</ENAMEX> puritanism"; and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, who held their nerve
throughout and "were able to distinguish between the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>,
accepting one even as they acknowledged the flaws in the other."

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">liberal Independent</ENAMEX> on
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> , in an editorial headlined "The stained presidency," said that "to
anyone sane it was always obvious that impeachment was a hideously
inappropriate and disproportionate punishment for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s 'low
crimes and misdemeanours,' " but that didn't absolve the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>. "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s
behavior has been contemptible throughout, from his initial offences, to his
legalistic evasions, to his unbearably mawkish and snivelling apologies," the
paper said. "Although <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> has shown again an astonishing talent for
survival, it cannot be pleasant for him to contemplate how his presidency will
be remembered by posterity."

            In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Repubblica</ENAMEX> focused on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s loneliness as he prepared to repay,
against <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> opposition, those who had stood by him for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13 months</TIMEX>--the
black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lobby</ENAMEX>, the women's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>, the left-wing <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX>, and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary</ENAMEX>--who would now be presenting their bills. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s task in his remaining <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18 months</TIMEX> in office is to show that he has
become a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>. His <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step--his apology to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rose</ENAMEX>
Garden on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX>--was "a step in that direction," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">La Repubblica</ENAMEX> said. It
concluded, "Perhaps even <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monica</ENAMEX>, watching him from afar, felt a last shudder of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tenderness</ENAMEX> and regret for her ex-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lover</ENAMEX>, so important and so alone."

            In its editorial <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX>
headlined "The rout of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judges</ENAMEX>," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Le Monde</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s victory in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> impeachment trial "the first serious setback for the crusade led by the
neo-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">conservatives</ENAMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the beginning of the 1980s</TIMEX> to dictate the morality and
sexuality of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>." It said, "A certain <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> has triumphed over the
other: that of humanist good sense has beaten that of the fundamentalist
preachers, that which wants to preserve certain achievements of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s</TIMEX> has
beaten that which wants to abolish them. ... The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> has recognized itself
more in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Clinton</ENAMEX> than in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth Starr</ENAMEX>, and so much the better."

            <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>'s most influential <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toronto</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Globe</ENAMEX> and
Mail , said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX> in an editorial that the reason <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> had
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">forgiven Clinton</ENAMEX> his lies and misdemeanors was that he was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victim</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">entrapment</ENAMEX>--"by a politically motivated independent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecutor</ENAMEX> ... using
information that invaded his privacy and subjected him and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> to
worldwide humiliation." The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> added, "If Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> survives as something
of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victim</ENAMEX> through all this, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monica Lewinsky</ENAMEX> survives as something of a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">heroine</ENAMEX>. Of all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> involved, she is the one who apparently never lied
or knowingly broke a confidence. She never sought publicity about her affair
with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX>, and so far has done nothing to exploit it. ... Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX>
has behaved with admirable restraint and dignity throughout the piece, the only
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">player</ENAMEX> to come out entirely clean."

            In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX>, the
semi-official press was determined not to write off <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lame duck</ENAMEX>. "It
is difficult to concede to the argument that, despite his acquittal, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Clinton</ENAMEX> is likely to be paralyzed through his remaining period
in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ahram</ENAMEX> said in an editorial <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX>. But it pointed out that "some of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s major achievements, such as the peace deal in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ireland</ENAMEX>, the strategic
partnership with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Wye Plantation Memorandum</ENAMEX> between the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Palestinians</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israelis</ENAMEX>, have been attained at the peak of his crisis.
... It does not stand to reason, then, that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who so succeeds while
preoccupied with a moral scandal that could have cost him his seat at the Oval
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Office</ENAMEX>, would be paralyzed and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">disabled</ENAMEX> once the episode is over."

            Following <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madeleine Albright</ENAMEX>'s visit to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rambouillet</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> to inject some momentum into the stalled <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kosovo</ENAMEX> talks,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Le Figaro</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX> that there was a rare unity at the moment among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the "contact <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>"--the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> leading <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">western European</ENAMEX> powers,
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>--despite <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>'s constant temptation to put
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX>, "the unchallenged instrument of its politico-military domination of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Europe</ENAMEX>," at the center of the stage, which, in the view of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moscow</ENAMEX>,
would risk benefiting the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Albanians</ENAMEX> and threatening only the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Serbs</ENAMEX>. The paper
said the most important question remained what would happen if an agreement
isn't reached by the extended <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Feb. 20</TIMEX> deadline, and to that "nobody knows the
answer." <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Libération</ENAMEX> carried a cartoon of a fierce-looking <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albright</ENAMEX>
brandishing a fly swatter and saying, "Make peace or shit!" But it said she had
"broken the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX>" at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rambouillet</ENAMEX>.

            As he prepared to leave
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> to set up an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Shakespeare Company</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>'s most
famous theater <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX>, Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Hall</ENAMEX>, wrote in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mail</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX>
that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prime Minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tony Blair</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> of "<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cool Britannia</ENAMEX>," has in fact
betrayed the arts by refusing them subsidies. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX> said that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> has
enjoyed "a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">half-century</TIMEX> of pre-eminence in this field of endeavor" and that
this could now be destroyed. "Never forget that, in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare</ENAMEX>'s time, we
created the greatest theater culture in the history of the world. ... Some <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> after his death, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">theaters</ENAMEX> had been destroyed, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actors</ENAMEX> dismissed
and the playwrights sent into exile. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roundheads</ENAMEX> had arrived. They seem to
be visible again."
