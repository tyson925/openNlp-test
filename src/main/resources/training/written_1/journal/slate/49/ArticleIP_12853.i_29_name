Wrap-Up
            

            Most replies envisioned a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> of corrupt,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">childish</ENAMEX>, lubricious egomaniacs--much like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lord</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Flies</ENAMEX> , but with
overt sex and more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> who look like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Piggy</ENAMEX>.

            Or, to put it another way, perhaps the reason the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> risked in-office eroticism rather than taking her to a nice <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX> is
that there is no nice <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX>. Not the right kind of nice <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX>. If we live in an
age of rampant infidelity (generally the most popular kind, by the way), it is
in spite of the failure of the free market to provide seductive accommodations.
Oh, there are hot-bed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">motels</ENAMEX> out near the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX>, a lovely thing for those who
can only function sexually in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1972</TIMEX>; the waterbeds and mirrors must be a great
comfort. It's like bad pornography expressed as architecture.

            In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>, there are romantic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> available for
passionate afternoons well away from any flight path. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX>, where the
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartments</ENAMEX> are small, there are "love <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX>" in a goofy and playful variety of
styles. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>, where the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartments</ENAMEX> are small, there is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starbucks</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manhattan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> cater to the business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traveler</ENAMEX>; there are high-resolution fax
machines but low thread-count sheets. And neither is available just for a
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">languorous afternoon</TIMEX>.

            Or to put it another way,
why is there no hotel <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">toothpaste</ENAMEX>? In their restless effort to offer the guest
simulated luxury, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> provide a sewing kit, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">soap</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">shampoo</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> gel, a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bible</ENAMEX>, a robe, and a shower cap, but no <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">toothpaste</ENAMEX>. Why not? Just say you were
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dentist</ENAMEX> seeking a stolen hour of bliss; where would you go? Just say you were
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">congressman</ENAMEX> who looked like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Piggy</ENAMEX> and cared about the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Constitution</ENAMEX>, sensual
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">delights</ENAMEX>, and good oral hygiene; what kind of accommodations would you
want?

Follow-Up
            

            "While
the imagination runs the gamut from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hunter Thompson</ENAMEX>-esque 'Ether ... and a
fax machine' to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Van Halen</ENAMEX>-esque 'no red M&Ms!!!!,' we are reminded of a
real memo we once read, written by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paramount</ENAMEX>, describing the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">accommodations</ENAMEX> demanded by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barry Diller</ENAMEX> in his hotel <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">suites</ENAMEX>. 'A box of fresh

               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EUROPEN FOR</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BUSINESS</ENAMEX>: Now that the money is a different color, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreigners</ENAMEX> will be
able to buy a lot more things, or perhaps a lot fewer.

            
               ON A
EUROLL: With the new international money, everyone finally knows what
everything costs--it's all surprisingly affordable, apparently--and they're
buying it.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EURONLY AS RICH AS</ENAMEX>
YOU FEEL: Buying stuff is making everyone happy, even when it turns
out they'd misread the price tag--they thought it was in <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">pesetas</NUMEX>--so now
everyone is in debt but euphoric.

            
               NO <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PUBLIC</ENAMEX>
EURONATION: A cold splash of reality from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Times</ENAMEX> ,
insisting that poor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> not be made to feel good at the expense of rich
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> feeling better.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EURO, EURO, EURO</ENAMEX>
YOUR BOAT: A lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are sailing those huge <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factory</ENAMEX> trawlers up
to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North Atlantic</ENAMEX> to mock the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Swedes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Danes</ENAMEX> for missing out on all the
shopping. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stupid Danes</ENAMEX>.

            

               ISN'T IT EUROMANTIC: It's tough to explain to the
noneconomist, but wealthy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> turn out to have a lot of fun and some sex, as
predicted by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Maynard Keynes</ENAMEX>. This is good for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>. Or perhaps
bad.
