            seeing
her off
only incense greets him
coming back into the room

            
stretched on the floor
after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a long day</TIMEX>'s talking
rubbing noses with his <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>

            first
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">frost</ENAMEX> whitens grasses,
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">white</ENAMEX> smoke
from his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX>'s cabin

            snow at
night:
deep-sleeping population
comes drifting down

            friend
not seen for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>:
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gray</ENAMEX> whiskers
around the boyish smile

            after
the staid snowfalls
the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rain</ENAMEX> now
splashy as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>

            on and
on
reading a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX>'s new novel
wishing to be more kind

            the
great dead mallow
ready for chopping
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">springs</ENAMEX> purple <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>

            mind
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">wandering,</ENAMEX>
suddenly driving very fast:
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mozart</ENAMEX> in the car

            
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX>' market
carrying <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> carefully
down crowded aisles

            girls
jump rope
in out pepper pepper
old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> wipes his brow

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">evening</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">tea</ENAMEX>
contemplating the great kindness
of everyone

            before
they risk a word
the poets at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">lily</ENAMEX> pond
drink <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> cups of wine

            awkward
moment:
gazing into each other's eyes
a bit too long

            
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">summer</ENAMEX>'s offering
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ants</ENAMEX> on the windowsill
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ants</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>'s dish

            on
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hendry's Beach</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">respectable</ENAMEX>, leashed <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX>, sniffed
by free-ranging others

            
collecting beach stones
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">holes</ENAMEX> and odd edges:
slow artistry

            
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">house</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> scurry
awake from their naps
after the heat of the day

            digging
out the dandelions;
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">readying</ENAMEX> ground
for the next generation

            
throw-aways at the curb:
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inside-out</ENAMEX> umbrella
bed that wouldn't work

            the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">poppies</ENAMEX> sway
the wind looks around
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat licks</ENAMEX> herself

            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">awake,</ENAMEX>
listening:
laughter of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guest</ENAMEX> love-makers
trying to be more quiet

            cooling
evening breeze:
the potted <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> take water
yield back earth-scent

            late
for work
he stands there reading
an old love letter

            patch of moonlight
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rocking</ENAMEX>, rocking,
won't come in with the tide
