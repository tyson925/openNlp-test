            Events
have unfolded so rapidly since this question was posted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last Thursday</TIMEX> that it's
difficult to distinguish the smelly from the lethargic, the lethargic from the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">incoherent</ENAMEX>, the incoherent from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Hyde</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Holocaust</ENAMEX> history. As I understand
it, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Livingston</ENAMEX> announced his resignation, demanded the president
follow suit, and called for those other adulterers, former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Presidents</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kennedy</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eisenhower</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roosevelt</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackson</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jefferson</ENAMEX> to return from the dead and
resign retroactively. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Livingston</ENAMEX>'s rationale seems to be that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> take
government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> as their role <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> (particularly those in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Communications Commission</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bureau of Weights</ENAMEX> and Measures--did I get
that part right?), most of whom now have the shoe deals <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nike</ENAMEX> just canceled with
out of work <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">basketball</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX>. And of course You've got <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mail</ENAMEX> opened,
along with its homosexual pornographic knockoff, You've Got <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Males</ENAMEX> . I'm
exhausted. But I won't resign.

Answer
            

            Someone like this is probably an
inhalant-abusing teenager.

            "Few realize that just one sniff can cause death,"
asserts the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Partnership</ENAMEX> for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drug-Free America</ENAMEX>. To find out which ordinary
household products will get you high, ask your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>. "Half of all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>-15 year
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">olds</ENAMEX> have been offered inhalants." Sorry, I mean "Warn your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> before it's
too late, because we don't recommend the other means of detection. It's called
an autopsy.

            "To learn more about inhalants, what they are, and
where in your <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> they can be found [Oh, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lordy</ENAMEX>, those bastards have been been
poking around my home!], we urge you to call (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">800</ENAMEX>) <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">729-6686</TIMEX>."

            None are sequels, but <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>,
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> are actual movies, although I may have mistranslated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>.
