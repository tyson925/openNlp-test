            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> articles and a photo
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">essay</ENAMEX> chronicle <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX>'s bleakness. The grimmest piece describes how <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russians</ENAMEX>
in a small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> survive without money: They skip rent payments, grow <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> in

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vladimir Nabokov</ENAMEX> reviews his own autobiography. (He wrote the review of
his book in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1950</TIMEX> but never published it.) It is a superb review, though he's a

for having performed a very capable and very necessary job," writes Mr.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nabokov</ENAMEX>. ... A fascinating article tells the real story of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Billy</ENAMEX> the
