            I demand hazard pay. In the
course of researching and writing this article I suffered crippling bouts of
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> and added <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> pounds of blubber around my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">middle</ENAMEX>. I incurred the derision of
my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> by using the microwave in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">communal kitchen</ENAMEX> area to nuke a
Salisbury steak that made the entire floor stink like a middle-school
cafeteria. The stacks of empty <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Swanson Hungry Man and Healthy Choice</ENAMEX> boxes on
my desk still get funny looks. I have poisoned myself in so many ways. But I
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ate</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX> of those dinners just for you, dear <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX>, so that you can navigate the
frozen dinner aisle in your local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">supermarket</ENAMEX> with flair and ease.

            Microwave ovens have
their limitations. Remember that they work by agitating (and thus heating) the
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> and fat molecules in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX>, which means that whatever you cook is pretty
much steamed. This is great for heating up leftovers and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX>, not so great
for baking a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cake</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saucy</ENAMEX> foods work, bready foods don't. But one great thing
microwaves have done is give a new life to an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> classic. What could be
better than a full dinner, including <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dessert</ENAMEX>, that goes from freezer to table
in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">seven minutes</TIMEX> with no dishes to wash?

            The scores of offerings at your average supermarket divide
down to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about four</NUMEX> basic categories: traditional, healthy, budget, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vegetarian</ENAMEX>. I used the same standards in judging all of them: taste, nutrition,
presentation, and ease of preparation. Here's a list of best and worst by
category.

            

               Traditional : Generally high in fat and calories, these dinners
are the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">descendants</ENAMEX> of the TV dinners of old. The main brands are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stouffer's</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Swanson</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marie Callender's</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marie Callender's</ENAMEX> is the gold standard here.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marie</ENAMEX> offers a full plate of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> weighing a whole pound, and there are
separate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sauce</ENAMEX> packets that you heat and add to the dinner when you serve it.
The results are great. The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Breaded Chicken Parmigiana</ENAMEX>, for example, comes out
dry and unsoaked by the marinara <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sauce</ENAMEX>. But they have their drawbacks. First,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fat</ENAMEX> content puts them into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Mac</ENAMEX> territory, generally <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 30 grams</NUMEX>.
Worse, they require a lot of work. You puncture the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sauce pouch</ENAMEX>, toss the
dinner in, pull it out, peel back parts of the film cover, toss the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sauce</ENAMEX> pouch
in, fire up the oven again, take it out again, pour on the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sauce</ENAMEX> ... It all
adds up to a good <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15 minutes</TIMEX> of work from freezer to table. You might as well
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cook</ENAMEX>.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prize</ENAMEX> for best traditional dinner goes to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Swanson</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boneless White Meat Fried Chicken Dinner</ENAMEX>. With <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">430</NUMEX> calories and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">16 grams</NUMEX> of fat
(<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">150</NUMEX> calories from fat), this dinner almost meets the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Heart</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Association</ENAMEX> nutrition guidelines, which recommend <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">no more than 30 percent</NUMEX> of
your calorie intake be derived from fat. It couldn't be simpler to prepare and
is surprisingly tasty. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chicken</ENAMEX>'s not exactly crispy, but it is remarkably
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unrubbery</ENAMEX>. (The most common flaw of microwaved <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> is a gag-inducing springy
texture.) The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meat</ENAMEX> has a grain to it, so you know it's not compressed, and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">meal</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> side dishes are microwave-friendly: <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">corn</ENAMEX>, green <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beans</ENAMEX>, and mashed
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">potatoes</ENAMEX>. The veggies are flavorful with a bit of crunch to them, and the
mashed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">potatoes</ENAMEX> are buttery and smooth. Best of all, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dessert</ENAMEX> is a darn good
brownie: crispy on top, cakey on the bottom, the way they're supposed to be.
And the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">compartmented cardboard dish</ENAMEX> is an elegant homage to the classic TV
dinner's punched metal tray, making for a heady mix of convenience and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">formalism</ENAMEX>. A clear winner.

            But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Swanson</ENAMEX> also takes
home the prize for worst traditional dinner. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boneless Pork Rib Shaped Patty</ENAMEX>
is a shoddy imitation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McDonald's</ENAMEX> much beloved <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">McRib</ENAMEX>. The rib-shaped patty is
studded with visible chunks of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fat</ENAMEX> (reflecting the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">37 grams</NUMEX> listed on the
label), and it sits in a pool of orange grease. (The label calls it barbecue
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sauce</ENAMEX>.) The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beans</ENAMEX>, too sweet and without a hint of tanginess, were also
disappointing. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dessert</ENAMEX> was billed as "apple crumb," but it looked like
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">beige Jell-O</ENAMEX> and was sticky and bland. The dinner had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,440</NUMEX> milligrams of
sodium--<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60 percent</NUMEX> of your recommended <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> intake--and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">750</NUMEX> calories, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">330</NUMEX> of
them from fat. All in all, a heart attack on a cardboard plate.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX> ealthy : The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meals</ENAMEX> that bill themselves as "healthy"
varied widely in nutritional content and--a key point--size. Some carry very
low calorie and fat contents. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Weight Watchers</ENAMEX>' Smart <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Ones Fiesta</ENAMEX>
Chicken has <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only 2 grams</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fat</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">210</NUMEX> calories. Others, such as Healthy
Choice's <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Country Breaded Chicken With Scalloped Potatoes, Garden Vegetables in</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Butter Sauce</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Sour Cherry Compote</ENAMEX>, with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">9 grams</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fat</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">350</NUMEX> calories,
barely qualify as healthy. The diet dinners have controlled portions--9 or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
ounces compared with the traditional dinner's pound or so--and you might be
tempted to eat more than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>, with a corresponding doubling of the fat and
caloric intake. The category <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">winner</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Lean Cuisine's Oriental Beef With</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Vegetables</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Long Grain Rice</ENAMEX>, had combination of great taste and solid
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nutrition</ENAMEX>. Weighing in at <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">9.25 ounces</NUMEX>, the dinner included firm <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meat</ENAMEX>, crisp
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water chestnuts</ENAMEX>, and flavorful <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sauce</ENAMEX>, and it had only <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">240</NUMEX> calories and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.5</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">grams</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fat</ENAMEX>.

            For those watching their weight, microwave dinners
are a better choice than you might think, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis J. Aronne</ENAMEX>, a
weight loss <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialist</ENAMEX> and associate professor of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cornell</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University</ENAMEX>. The portions are controlled and the nutritional information clear.
And compared to other low-effort meals--say, takeout <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX>--these dinners are
far healthier. Add frozen <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">brussels sprouts</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salad</ENAMEX> to one of the smaller
healthy microwave meals, and you have what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aronne</ENAMEX> calls "a very reasonable
dinner."

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prize</ENAMEX> for the worst
healthy dinner goes to <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Lean Cuisine's Salisbury Steak With Macaroni and Cheese</ENAMEX>.
Yep, that's the one that stank when cooking. Surprisingly, the steak itself
isn't bad--it had a nice hint of rosemary--but the macaroni and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cheese</ENAMEX> was
appallingly bland. For <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only 9.5 ounces</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> it had <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">8 grams</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fat</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX>
milligrams of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">590</NUMEX> milligrams of sodium.

            C heap: The most common brands are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Budget Gourmet</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">America's Choice</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Banquet</ENAMEX>. Best of category is a tough <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> here. Cheap
microwave dinners are a mark of humiliation--something you eat while crying in
your <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">studio apartment</ENAMEX>, huddling in front of the space heater, and reading
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bell Jar</ENAMEX> . Interestingly, each brand is awful in its own way. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Banquet Honey-Roasted Turkey Meal</ENAMEX> offered literally a single slice of
cold-cut-style <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">turkey</ENAMEX>--<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about one-eighth</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">an inch</NUMEX> thick--on a sparse bed of
hopelessly damp and chewy stuffing. The gravy formed strings as I lifted the
fork to my mouth. But at least it came on a nice paper plate.

            The worst is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Budget</ENAMEX>
Gourmet. It is the cuisine equivalent of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">landlord banging</ENAMEX> at your door. You
eat the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Chicken With Fettuccini Cream Sauce</ENAMEX> straight out of the ripped-open
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">box.</ENAMEX> The portion is tiny, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chicken</ENAMEX> is in rubbery cubes so uniform they
barely look like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">noodles</ENAMEX> are all clumped together on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> side.
You have to pull them apart with a fork.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V</ENAMEX> egetarian : For overall brand consistency, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amy</ENAMEX>'s is
a solid choice and, as a bonus, most of the meals are organic. In fact, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amy</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cheese Enchilada With Beans and Corn</ENAMEX> was bound for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">winner</ENAMEX>'s circle until
overtaken at the wire by a dark <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horse</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Green Guru</ENAMEX>, a brand I was able to find
in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">supermarket</ENAMEX>. Green <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Guru's Vegetable Gaeng Daeng With Jasmine Rice</ENAMEX>
enchanted my palate. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX> was light and cooked to perfection, and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetables</ENAMEX> were nicely steamed in a complex <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sauce</ENAMEX> that blended the subtle
flavors of curry, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coconut milk</ENAMEX>, and basil. There was enough hot pepper to be
interesting, but not so much that this tenderfoot was scared off. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mushrooms</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">broccoli</ENAMEX>, bamboo shoots, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX> corn all retained good
textures, and the tofu chunks seemed like a stroke of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genius</ENAMEX>. At its best, tofu
is supposed to be springy, and this dish proved how ideally suited it is
to the microwave's wily ways. This dinner was better than many I've had in
actual <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Thai</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>.

            The worst vegetarian
dinner? Well, there's only one way to describe <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Hain's Vegetarian Pepper Steak:</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hainous</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX> was undercooked, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sauce</ENAMEX> was a viscous, grainy gel. And
the whole concept of it seemed misguided: What vegetarian wants to eat
something labeled as "steak," even if it is molded soy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>? The "steak" was
like the worst hamburger you've ever eaten: sticky, tasteless, and just plain
off.

            TV dinners carry a terrible stigma. They conjure up a
flip-flop-clad <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">matron</ENAMEX> in a housedress, cigarette dangling from her mouth,
slapping a metal tray in front of a sullen <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> at the dinner table. But
what most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diners</ENAMEX> don't know is that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">matron</ENAMEX> was on to something. Aronne
notes that because the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetables</ENAMEX> in microwave dinners are frozen, they may
retain more nutrients than those you'd buy fresh. The oxidation of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nutrients</ENAMEX> is much greater in fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX> than in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX> that are frozen quickly
after harvest. Your fresh supermarket broccoli probably had a long journey from
the place it was grown, losing vitamins all the way. Boiling the veggies at
home compounds the problem, as the soluble vitamins get poured down the drain.
Armed with the hard-won discoveries I sacrificed my waistline for, you can go
to your <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">supermarket</ENAMEX> and confidently fill your shopping cart. Once home, you can
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">peel</ENAMEX> back the plastic film covers of our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">winners</ENAMEX> with a steady hand, sure that
the odors that emanate will not offend.
