                  Dear
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudence</ENAMEX>,
               
            

            
               As <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX> has drawn to a close, I have found
myself in evaluation mode and have felt ever increasingly blue and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bluer</ENAMEX>.
            

            
               Though I do long for a permanent relationship,
I also have not been gathering moss till the right one comes along. The result
is I have several ongoing, fairly long-term relationships that are basically
sex and nothing more. All these gents are unavailable for reasons of geography,
marital status, and/or neuroses. The problem is, even though there is no
pressure for me to make any of these relationships permanent, none of these
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> treats me very well. I'm not talking trinkets here, either. I just don't
feel warm and fuzzy--more like cheap and tawdry!
            

            
               Is a big
housecleaning the answer?
            

            

               --<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Confused</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big City</ENAMEX>
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dear Con</ENAMEX>,

            YES!! A big housecleaning is the answer. And <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudie</ENAMEX>
knows you will succeed because you are so cleareyed about what's wrong. It is
not everyone who can be her own <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chorus</ENAMEX>.

            Turn your blue to white: Become a born-again
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">virgin</ENAMEX>. Get your self-respect back. Only <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">truck</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> you decide are
worthwhile. It will be a new beginning. How insightful you are to use the word
"unavailable." And how wise to want to bag relationships in which the other
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> is far away, married, or a filbert. The time has definitely come to say
to all these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chaps</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adios</ENAMEX>, yo-yo. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Translation</ENAMEX>: Farewell ... you're on your
own.)

            Do begin again, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudie</ENAMEX> predicts <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX> will be your <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>. Let us all know how things develop.

                  Dear
Prudie,
               
            

            
               Growing up, I was taught that a gentleman
precedes a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX> when entering a public place (e.g., a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX>), as a sort of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vanguard</ENAMEX>, and follows her upon exiting. Is this behavior still appropriate
and/or useful?
            

            
               Please reply
to
            

            

               --<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anonymous</ENAMEX>, via Internet. Thank you.
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dear Anon</ENAMEX>,

            Your training is still
appropriate. Good manners never go out of style. If <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudie</ENAMEX> could channel Emily
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX>, however, she might suggest that you also precede the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX> upon leaving an
establishment, if only to push or hold the door open.

            
--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudie</ENAMEX>, precedently

            
               
                  Dear
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudence</ENAMEX>,
               
            

            
               What is with all these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who take offense
at social pleasantries? And why are you encouraging them? Salutations such as
"How are you?" and "Have a nice day" are obviously free of malicious intent and
have virtually no semantic content, thus providing no basis for umbrage. Such
pleasantries are clearly intended to be both polite and friendly, and
responding to proffered congeniality with disdain, reproof, or sarcasm is
nothing short of boorish. Rudeness needs dissuasion rather than promotion, as
there is already rather enough to go around.
            

            
               Have a nice <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX> (a
sincere wish, expressing my hope that the reproving tone of my missive will not
tarnish your humor).
            

            

               --<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Douceur</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bellevue</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wash.</ENAMEX>
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dear John</ENAMEX>,

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudie</ENAMEX> is not
anti-semantic. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Au</ENAMEX> contraire , she is so devoted to language, as it
appears are you, that it pains her to hear empty phrases bruited about.
However, your point is taken that well-meaning pleasantries should be accepted
for what they are, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudie</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">New Year</TIMEX>'s resolution is to chill when it comes
to banalities. How's that?

            
--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudie</ENAMEX>, resolutely

            
               
                  Dear
Prudie,
               
            

            
               As for "Have a nice day," it has the same ring
of sincerity as the robot-voiced "Your call is important to us, please continue
to hold."
            

            
               Approaching an
acquaintance I haven't seen in a while I often say, "<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Nice</ENAMEX> to see you" (which is
true). The reply, "<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Nice</ENAMEX> to see you, too," can be completed quickly, sparing
each of us the awkward <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX>-swiveling to which "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">How are you?</ENAMEX>" "Fine ... how are
you?" often leads.
            

            
               Yours,
            

            

               --<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Calculating</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dear Cal</ENAMEX>,

            Do you know what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudie</ENAMEX>
is thinking? <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudie</ENAMEX> is thinking your idea is stellar. Let's both make an effort
to say this in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">'99</TIMEX> and see if we can make any headway with the
"Have-a-nice-day" and "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">How-are-you?</ENAMEX>" <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX>.

            --<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudie</ENAMEX>, hopefully
