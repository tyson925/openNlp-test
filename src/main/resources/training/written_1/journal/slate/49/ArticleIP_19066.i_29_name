            Have you ever set the dials
in your head to register with maximum sensitivity any new encounter with a
particular word or phrase? I put the dials on high alert <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few weeks ago</TIMEX> for
groovy , spurred by a spate of printed sightings. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> magazine
had just referred to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Winona Ryder</ENAMEX> in passing as "the groovy gamine." The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> at about the same time complimented the "groovy
appearance" of the iMac computer. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicago Tribune</ENAMEX> published a list
of Web sites for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> that it had found to be "full of groovy games." A
commentary in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">London Independent</ENAMEX> about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>'s fuddy-duddy
Conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Party</ENAMEX> and its forlorn attempts at image enhancement observed,
"Here they are, doing their best to be a little bit groovy , a little bit
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Labour</ENAMEX>, and what do we do? We snigger."

            Meanwhile, a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">communication</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> of 
                  Slate
                brought my attention not
so much to sightings as to hearings. He wrote:

            
               D----<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S----</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> not given to air quotes,
just told me it was "groovy" that I would call him back later about something.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Young R----</ENAMEX>, a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">summer intern</TIMEX>, used the word constantly but with a smirk. ...
I've heard it used by grown-ups, without apparent irony, within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the past hour</TIMEX>.
I guess it's gone the route of "cool"--revived as quaint and retro by young
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'uns</ENAMEX> and gradually de-ironized. I assume the term originated as a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">'40s</NUMEX> or '50s
hip allusion to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LP</ENAMEX> record. But maybe not.
            

            Well, close. Briefly, the word dates back to jazz circles
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1930s</TIMEX> and ultimately derives from the phrase "in the groove," meaning
"performing or doing exceptionally well." What the "groove" in that phrase
originally referred to is hard to establish definitively, because several
meanings current in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1930s</TIMEX> all permit plausible theories. Many dictionaries
do link the groove of in the groove to the groove of a record.
But groove could also refer to the path between a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pitcher</ENAMEX> and the strike
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">zone</ENAMEX> (and had done so since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the turn of the century</TIMEX>); a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pitcher</ENAMEX> who was
throwing "in the groove" was throwing very well. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Groove</ENAMEX> also had a
vulgar sexual connotation, which could likewise give in the groove the
connotation of high performance and pleasure. And groove could simply
mean a "style," a sense associated with the parallel between being in a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">groove</ENAMEX> and being in a rut . (In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19 th century</TIMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">groovy</ENAMEX> actually meant "to be in a rut" or to be "of settled habits" or
"conventional"; the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Oxford English Dictionary</ENAMEX> citation for this
kind of grooviness is dated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1867</TIMEX>.) In any event, by the 1940s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">groovy</ENAMEX> had expanded beyond the jazz world and--a harbinger of what would
happen in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s and '70s</TIMEX>--was being used by nongroovy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> in a typically
pathetic attempt to seem hip. Here's a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buick</ENAMEX> ad, cited by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Dalzell</ENAMEX>, a
lexicographer of slang, in his terrific book <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Flappers 2 Rappers : "Stand</ENAMEX>
off and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">beam</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buick</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>-ahead style--there's something not only favored
by the old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX>, but termed by the younger idea, definitely groovy !"
The ad appeared in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1946</TIMEX>.

            After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1940s</TIMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">groovy</ENAMEX> went dormant for a time; reference books begin to refer to it as
"archaic" or "obsolete." Then came its re-emergence in Beat and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hippie patois</ENAMEX>,
and its ascension into totemic status, as the primary pop-cultural word that
future <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX> would associate with the youth culture of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s</TIMEX>. (During
the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> presidential campaign, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Letterman</ENAMEX>'s "Top <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> ways <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Dole</ENAMEX> is
trying to appear younger" included the following at the No. 9 spot: "Peppers
his speeches with words such as groovy and outasight .") A nuance
that the future may not always appreciate, though, is how ironic or playfully
self-conscious its usage usually was. I suspect that the word has long existed
in a netherworld between interjectional utility and outright put-on. Perhaps an
ingenuous minority used it innocently in its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hippie</ENAMEX> heyday; but most often one
heard it uttered with a bit of wonderment, as if the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX> couldn't believe
that he or she was really using the word.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Groovy</ENAMEX> continues to thrive, with the same sort of
ambivalence attached to it. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> disagree only about the full extent of
its range. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anne H. Soukhanov</ENAMEX>, who oversaw the most recent (<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX>) edition of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Heritage Dictionary</ENAMEX> and is now the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">North American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Encarta World English Dictionary</ENAMEX> , recalls coming across the word
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these days</TIMEX> mostly in speech, "especially in sardonic and sarcastic replies to
negative-context statements such as 'Dad, I just wrecked your new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>' or 'This
to inform you that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> has targeted you for a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 year</TIMEX> audit,' where its use
as an interjectional reply parallels similar use of standard terms like
'beautiful,' 'terrific,' or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">'great</NUMEX>.' "

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Morse</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX>
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merriam-Webster</ENAMEX> dictionaries, sees groovy less as a bit of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">exotica</ENAMEX> and more as a robust adapter to an ever-changing present. "Often," he
says, drawing on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merriam-Webster</ENAMEX>'s voluminous citation files, "groovy is used
in reference to something from, or reminiscent of, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s</TIMEX> (clothing,
spiritualism, things that glow in black light), but just as often (actually,
more often) the word appears to be used in reference to the contemporary scene.
We have examples of trendy addresses in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Miami Beach</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biker-gal</ENAMEX> sunglasses, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTV</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">videos</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> where hip-hop music is played, and jazz-rap crossover music all
being described as groovy and all without hint of irony." The examples come
from such <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publications</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rolling Stone</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TV Guide</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Elle</ENAMEX> ,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Village Voice</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The New Yorker</ENAMEX> . "The word," says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morse</ENAMEX>,
"appears to live on."

            It lives on, but its evolution seems to be taking different
forms in captivity and in the wild. Such, at any rate, is slang specialist
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dalzell</ENAMEX>'s surmise, and the comments by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Soukhanov</ENAMEX> (about the interjectional
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">groovy</ENAMEX> ) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morse</ENAMEX> (about groovy in printed citations) illustrate
the point. In the wild--that is, in the more freewheeling and inflected realm
of spoken language-- groovy thrives in a largely ironic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>; the use
of the word requires a context of wavelength synchrony between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">listener</ENAMEX>. In captivity--that is, in the more restrained and stylized realm of
written language--examples of the nonironic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groovy</ENAMEX> tend to predominate
heavily.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Groovy</ENAMEX> 's staying power--it has maintained
its meaning and its presence for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than six decades</TIMEX>--points up the
robustness, and even the relative antiquity, of much of what seems like
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">linguistic</ENAMEX> ephemera. Out of sight , meaning "incredibly wonderful" or
"extraordinary," is as current as ever; it goes back not to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the '60s</TIMEX> but to the
'40s--<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1840s</TIMEX>. Cool has experienced a change of intonation in the
1990s, becoming nearly bisyllabic, but it has been widely used over diverse
demographic terrain for most of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20 th century</TIMEX>, and it goes back
as a term of admiration ("That's right [i.e., very] cool ") to the first
half of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19 th century</TIMEX>. Duh , an interjection indicating
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stupidity</ENAMEX> or obviousness, emerged from 1940s animated cartoons, but its period
of greatest efflorescence is probably occurring right now. It enjoys life not
only as an interjection but also as a noun ("The movie's real duh of a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">raison d'être</ENAMEX>"-- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Village</ENAMEX> 
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Voice</ENAMEX> ) and an adjective ("That's so
duh you've got to smile"-- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los Angeles Times</ENAMEX> ). Bummer , one
1960s word that really did get its start in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the '60s</TIMEX> drug culture, is also
proving its hardiness, a testament both to the term's euphony and to the
ubiquity of bummers in the world at large.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cat</ENAMEX> , dig , and hipster are
enjoying a resurgence. So are bitchin' and stoked . Every
generation insists on having its own new words for the most aggressively
up-to-date aspects of life. (Well, duh.) But it's also true, as never before,
that the archives of sound and image constitute a continuous retro loop that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> can--and will--draw on. The situation is oddly appropriate: The idea of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">retro</ENAMEX> in a rut restores grooviness to its original meaning.
