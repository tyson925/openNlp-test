               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> leads with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jimmy Carter</ENAMEX> going public with his thoughts on the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinton</ENAMEX> fund-raising brouhaha. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX>
lead is that the top <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> tax <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> will introduce
legislation to radically alter <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> audit and dispute resolution procedures. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Angeles Times</ENAMEX> leads with state and local attempts at campaign reform.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> goes with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX>'s decision to
permit the extradition of a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17-year-old</TIMEX> back to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maryland</ENAMEX> to stand trial for a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gruesome</ENAMEX> murder, despite his claim that he's an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israeli</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizen</ENAMEX>. This was a
local story that became a national one when <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX>'s earlier pronouncement that
he could not be extradited had appeared to threaten <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israeli</ENAMEX> relations.

            On a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNN</ENAMEX> broadcast, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carter</ENAMEX> said that the investigation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s
fund-raising should be turned over to an independent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counsel</ENAMEX>. According to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAT</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carter</ENAMEX> said the scandal has enforced the "not always erroneous"
impression that getting help from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> requires paying a "legal bribe."
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> also reports that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan Burton</ENAMEX> said on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX>' "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Face the Nation"</ENAMEX> that
he thinks some of the fund-raising videotapes may have been "altered in some
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX>," that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arlen Specter</ENAMEX> said on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fox News Sunday</ENAMEX> that video of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinton</ENAMEX>
describing how <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DNC</ENAMEX> ads were helping him "is proof that he was evading the law,"
and that according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek</ENAMEX> coming out <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> fat
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">cat</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Jenrette</ENAMEX>, has come forward to say <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Clinton</ENAMEX> called him up from
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> to ask for money. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> has both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Burton</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jenrette</ENAMEX> stories, but runs them inside.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> lead explains that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Archer</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ways and Means Committee</ENAMEX>, is seizing on the recent uproar over <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> misbehavior
to put forward a legislative evergreen suddenly considered to have a good shot
at passage: a plan to shift the burden of proof in tax disputes from the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayer</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX>. The move is being strongly opposed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinton</ENAMEX>
administration and many tax <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> on the ground that adopting it would clog
the system, risk a decrease in tax revenues, and force the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> to become even
more aggressive. The paper points out that the number of people likely to be
affected by the change would be quite small--there are only <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 million</NUMEX> audits
annually and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only about 1,500</NUMEX> of them end up in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX>.

            Although the line-item veto had been the darling of several <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">presidents</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> , after surveying <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s targeted
cuts <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX> of federal subsidies to such <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporations</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Westinghouse</ENAMEX> and
3M, complains <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>'s line-item decision process "can
appear often arbitrary and highly vulnerable to politics." The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> says the
new presidential tool creates "post-season budget playoffs."

            A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAT</ENAMEX> front-page story reports that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Honda</ENAMEX> has developed a virtually
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pollution-free</ENAMEX> gasoline engine that will be as powerful as conventional ones,
and yet not more expensive.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> reports on its front page that a high-priority, classified
alert issued by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last August</TIMEX> saying that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> had probably conducted a
nuclear test on an island near the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Artic Circle</ENAMEX>--an alert that resulted in the
formal bawling out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ambassador</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>--was, in all
likelihood, a mistake. What the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> detected, it turns out, was an
earthquake.

            Despite such laws as the new federal anti-stalker statute, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX>
reports that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York State</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inmates</ENAMEX> are able to get home addresses of parties
connected to crimes they were convicted of, as well as crime scene photos of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> via the state <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Freedom of Information Act</ENAMEX>. Civil liberties <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, says
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>, vow to fight any reduction in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prisoner</ENAMEX>'s right to file FOIA
requests.

            Back to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> story on restraining the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX>: There's exactly one
example given of the kinds of cases the revision would apply to, and it speaks
volumes about the sort of people <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> tax <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reformers</ENAMEX> and/or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> most naturally think of: "...cases where the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayer</ENAMEX> and
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> presented conflicting but equally credible evidence--for example, the
value of a painting given to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>..."
