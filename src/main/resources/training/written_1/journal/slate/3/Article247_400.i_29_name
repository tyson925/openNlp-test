            In light of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary of State</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albright</ENAMEX>'s imminent trip to the middle east,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> ,
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Angeles Times</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> emphasize the deteriorating situation
there. But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA Today</ENAMEX> stays with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Princess</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Di</ENAMEX>.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> states that when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albright</ENAMEX> shows up on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX>, she will "read
the riot act" to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yassir Arafat</ENAMEX> about cracking down on terrorism. Her goal will
be to get <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arafat</ENAMEX> to come out decisively and publicly for peace with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX>,
telling him that there can be no more attempts at co-opting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hamas</ENAMEX>, and "no more
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kisses</ENAMEX>" of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX>.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> emphasizes the larger geopolitical context. Given that the
troubles on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Bank</ENAMEX> have not only frosted relations between <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arafat</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX>, but also those between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> and between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saudi</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arabia</ENAMEX>, the paper states that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> is now facing the prospect that the
moderate <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">coalition</ENAMEX> it built after the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Persian Gulf</ENAMEX> war to contain <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> is falling apart.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> focuses on new dissension within the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israeli</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> about
whether or not <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> should continue to maintain <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> in southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lebanon</ENAMEX>,
dissension fueled when an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israeli</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commando</ENAMEX> raid there <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late last week</TIMEX> was
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ambushed</ENAMEX>, with twelve deaths the result. Perhaps the most striking indicator of
a change of mood inside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> reported by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> is the news that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cabinet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ariel Sharon</ENAMEX>, who as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Minister</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1982</TIMEX> got <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX>
entrenched in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lebanon</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> place, is among those urging a
reconsideration of the deployment.

            Several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX> have word that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H and R Block</ENAMEX> has finally wriggled out of its
controlling stake of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Compuserve</ENAMEX>, but it's the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> with the news that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AOL</ENAMEX> is set to take it over.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Outlook</ENAMEX>" observes, "In the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> job
market, the balance of power is shifting to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employers</ENAMEX>," and
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> that "the retention frenzy was triggered in part by previous waves of
corporate downsizing," which left behind <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">survivors</ENAMEX> who took stock of career
options and used Internet job listings and intensified recruiting to land
better offers, which in turn led to counter-offers and higher salaries. This
has led, says the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal</ENAMEX> , to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> compensation rising <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6 percent</NUMEX> a
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>.

            Much of the continuing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diana</ENAMEX> coverage is spinning off into the realm of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">meta</ENAMEX>- and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">meta-meta-pieces</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> , for instance, examines what it
takes to be a new "cuddly-feely" <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> born of the national grief experience.
But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAT</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> also each run pretty newsy <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diana</ENAMEX> pieces as
well. Both reveal that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tony Blair</ENAMEX> had conferred with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diana</ENAMEX> about a goodwill
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ambassador</ENAMEX> job shortly before her death, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAT</ENAMEX> reports that Le
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Figaro</ENAMEX> says a dying <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diana</ENAMEX> gave <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> crash <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witnesses</ENAMEX> a message for her family
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>.

            Give the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> credit for getting Mother <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Teresa</ENAMEX> back on the front page
and a bonus point for including some criticism of her in the story. "Not
everyone in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Calcutta</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> for that matter, is unanimous in praising the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">nun</ENAMEX>, whose <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> was able to raise <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">millions of dollars</NUMEX> worldwide but
made virtually no significant changes in the social structure of this
collapsing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>'s poor neighborhoods. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salvation</ENAMEX>--hers and that of the destitute
she rescued from the gutters--was her aim, not economic or social development
as many others understand it, she said." It's odd, however, that in repeating
this charge, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> didn't interview the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> most closely associated
with it, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher Hitchens</ENAMEX>, or refer to the book where he set it out, The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Missionary Position</ENAMEX> . Hmmm, wanna bet there was a copy of the book on
somebody's desk at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> though?

            What's with the top-of-the-front headline the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> puts over its
picture of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martina Hingis</ENAMEX> standing next to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Venus Williams</ENAMEX> after beating her at
the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">U.S. Open</ENAMEX>--"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Venus Brought Back to Earth"</ENAMEX>? Doesn't that sound like
celebrating a defeat rather than celebrating a victory? How odd--and a good
illustration of how trying to shoe-horn in a "witty" headline can drive you
into an idea that doesn't fit or is undeserved. Given that Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Williams</ENAMEX>'
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> are rather protective of her and that she is a black in a still
pretty-lilly-white sport, don't be surprised if there's a bit of a complaint
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about this</TIMEX>.
