               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> lead with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Janet Reno</ENAMEX>'s decision to continue
her investigation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Clinton</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> campaign fund-raising, while the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX>
and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los Angeles Times</ENAMEX> go with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX>'s okay of
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oregon</ENAMEX>'s assisted suicide law.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reno</ENAMEX>'s decision was predicted by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX>. By contrast,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAT</ENAMEX> had said she was being advised to stop investigating. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAT</ENAMEX> says that her <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">task force</ENAMEX> had indeed been for stopping but
ultimately concluded there were too many unresolved legal questions to do so.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s reaction to the news: "I didn't do anything wrong."

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> turned down an appeal of a lower <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX>'s dismissal of a
lawsuit challenging <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oregon</ENAMEX>'s law, making that state the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> in the country
where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX>-assisted suicide is legal. A wrinkle in all this, reports the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> , is that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oregon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">legislature</ENAMEX> had already decided to put the
question to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> again, so another by-mail referendum currently underway
will probably be concluded before the original law can take effect.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> , more than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> , emphasizes the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX>'s
general stance on assisted suicide laws--that they involve no constitutional
issue and hence are the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX> of the individual <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>.

            It looks like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> is on its way to its <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> counter-reformation
referendum result in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a row</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> runs a front-page story concerning a
poll about a likely ballot measure that would virtually eliminate bilingual
public education in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>. Those surveyed are wildly for it. This
preference of landslide proportions doesn't vary much no matter the race,
income level or age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX>. And here's the big news: Latino
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> polled favored the initiative by an even greater margin than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX>.
Though fascinating, the story does have a defect common to much press poll
reporting--nowhere before the story's "jump" to the inside (where, it is well
known, a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> never tread) does the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> reveal how large the
sample is.

            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last spring</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> reported that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> had adopted a
policy of requiring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazines</ENAMEX> where it advertised to give it advance notice and
pre-publication content summaries of controversial articles. Today, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal</ENAMEX> , following up a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Detroit News</ENAMEX> story from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX>,
reports that, after mounting criticism from magazine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publishers</ENAMEX>,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> reversed itself. There are, however, notes the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal</ENAMEX> ,
other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> who still insist on editorial peeks. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ameritech</ENAMEX>, for
instance.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> gives front-page play to a study by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dartmouth</ENAMEX> medical
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> about the health-care treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> receive at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the end of</TIMEX>
their lives. Their findings: the amount of medical care received varies
tremendously around the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> and is apparently more a function of what's
available than of what's needed. For instance, even though there is no evidence
of major regional health or mortality differences, on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Coast</ENAMEX>, people
are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than two</NUMEX> times as likely to die in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are on the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Coast</ENAMEX>. The upshot: <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> preference about final care still isn't heeded
much, and much government medical spending on the elderly is unnecessary.

            There are fascinating details from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spy</ENAMEX> arrests on the
Times front. After the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Berlin Wall</ENAMEX> came down, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spies</ENAMEX>--a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX>, her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>, and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX>--who had sold secrets to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East Germany</ENAMEX> for
many <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, felt at loose ends and were anxious to get back in the game. And in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> wrote a very personal letter (the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> calls it an
"ideological come-on") to a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Communist</ENAMEX> in the post-apartheid <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South African</ENAMEX>
government indicating her availability to continue the old struggle. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>,
who had been monitoring this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> based on spotty information from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">East German</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intelligence</ENAMEX> files, intercepted the letter and forged a reply inviting her to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spy</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Africa</ENAMEX>. Eventually the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> met with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> she thought was a
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">South African</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> and for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1,000</NUMEX>, gave him a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> spending document and a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> memorandum on the international arms market. He was an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX>. Similar
traps were set for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>. The story contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> suggestion that
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> had a deep need to get caught: they named their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> after the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founders</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Communist Party</ENAMEX>.
