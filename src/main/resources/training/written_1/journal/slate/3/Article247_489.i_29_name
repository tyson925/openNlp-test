               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> leads with a look at the new federal and state tax breaks coming
in with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> leads with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s decision to
shut down his legal defense fund. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX>
goes with the ban on smoking in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bars</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> puts in place <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX>,
mentioning the possible advent there of "smoke-ins" and "smoke-easy's." The
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Angeles Times</ENAMEX> leads with word that a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">task force</ENAMEX> appointed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gov.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pete</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> will call for increased state oversight of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HMOs</ENAMEX> to make them more
patient-oriented.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> reveals that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s decision to shut down his defense fund was
prompted by controversy over the fund's implication in shady <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DNC</ENAMEX> fund-raising
practices and by dwindling contributions.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clintons</ENAMEX>, says the paper, now have nearly <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$3 million</NUMEX> in legal bills. And
the real story, which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> buries deep and leaves out of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">headline</ENAMEX>, is that they are actively looking for a better way to raise the cash.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> , in its front-page coverage, does more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">justice</ENAMEX> to this
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">angle</ENAMEX>, mentioning it in the headline and in the story lead. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Yesterday</TIMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> reports, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> said he'd asked the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counsel</ENAMEX> to study the
ethical and legal requirements governing future fund-raising efforts. (Thereby
exemplifying one dubious but legal cost-saving device he's making good use of:
getting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers</ENAMEX> to pay for research into what is essentially his private
legal problem.) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sources</ENAMEX> tell the paper the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clintons</ENAMEX> have approved a new vehicle
that, it is hoped, will avoid the restrictions that kept the old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">trust</ENAMEX> from
soliciting money for their use--by having it "independently" set up by some
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX>. (Isn't it amazing how this triangulation can be discussed so
openly and still be legal?)

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAT</ENAMEX> (in its off-lead) say the lapsed defense fund
had not been used to pay for any legal expenses arising from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paula Jones</ENAMEX>
case. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> says it had been used for some.

            The LAT front reports that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Latinos</ENAMEX>' longstanding
reluctance to vote--a trend that has consistently kept them politically
under-represented there--appears to be changing.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> passes along word that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">millionaires</ENAMEX>
continue to proliferate. According to the latest available tax stats, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>
there were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">87,000</NUMEX> seven-figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">earners</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>, an increase of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">24 percent</NUMEX>
over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX>.

            Both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> run stories on a development sure to be cited in
this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">libertarians</ENAMEX> chafing against proposed Internet regulation:
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>'s imposition <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> of stiff fines and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prison</ENAMEX> sentences for distribution
or consumption via the Net of "harmful information," defined as that which
"defames government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>," "impedes public order," or "damages state
interests." Both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> can be held in violation.

            Just in time, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> seems to have come up with the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Most Amazing</ENAMEX>
Headline of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>. Amazing because true: "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">D.C. Woman Who Killed Daughter Is Awarded Custody of Young</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Son</ENAMEX>." The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>, despite having been convicted of smothering her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX>
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX> to stop her from crying, and who is still in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prison</ENAMEX> after violating her
sentence of probation (!) by engaging in credit card fraud, was nonetheless
awarded custody by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> citing the need of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> for his biological mother
and his belief that because the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> is black, he'd be better off with his black
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> than with the white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> who filed papers to adopt him. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dear Reader</ENAMEX>,
this is why judicial recall procedures were invented.
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maureen Dowd</ENAMEX> adieus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">'97</NUMEX> with an interesting jeremiad against the 90s version
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice</ENAMEX>. She notes that there now seems to be much more emphasis on say, being
seen drinking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">martinis</ENAMEX> and smoking cigars than in actually enjoying the
activities themselves. "Once," she notes, "martinis and cigars were stylish
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">vices</ENAMEX>. Now they're <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice-ish</ENAMEX> styles." And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dowd</ENAMEX> repeats a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX>'s observation:
"The only reason they light up a cigar is because their mouths are too small to
light up a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Porsche</ENAMEX>."

            But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dowd</ENAMEX> must have had a little trouble making her word count: she hits
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nexis</ENAMEX> (aka "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Columnist Helper"</ENAMEX>) pretty hard, filling out her wicked but simple
point with quotes from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander Woolcott</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">P.G. Wodehouse</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Gigot</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mary</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McGrory</ENAMEX>.

            Back to that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT California</ENAMEX> cigarette ban story: The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX>
headline <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> missed a big chance: "<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Smoke Bar Bars Bar Smoke</ENAMEX>."
