            At the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> ,
the lead story is the strongest indication yet from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> administration
that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> may remain in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bosnia</ENAMEX> past the originally stated pull-out date.
At the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Angeles Times</ENAMEX> , it's the announcement (made while <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Gore</ENAMEX> was in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moscow</ENAMEX>
on a state visit) that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> has promised to stop making weapons-grade
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plutonium</ENAMEX>. Both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA Today</ENAMEX>
lead with new prospects for a campaign finance reform bill.

            The bi-partisan <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain-Feingold</ENAMEX> campaign reform bill, which would ban
unregulated "soft money" donations, and which has been languishing in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> for quite a while, got a new lease on life <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">President</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> threatened in a letter to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Majority Leader</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trent Lott</ENAMEX> to force <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>
to stay in session to vote on the measure. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> elaborates a bit on
the presidential power to keep <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> in session, and points out that it
hasn't been exercised since <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harry Truman</ENAMEX> called back the "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Do-Nothing</ENAMEX>" <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1948</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> also illustrates <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trent Lott</ENAMEX>'s aggravation at the gambit,
quoting his warning: "The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> has lots of conferences, legislation,
appropriations and fast-track [trade <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">authority</ENAMEX>] that he wants to get through.
Threats don't serve him very well." <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">USAT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> letter
was one of several moves "trying to deflect attention from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>'s own
fund-raising role in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> election," and quotes bill opponent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitch</ENAMEX>
McConnell as saying, "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> calling for campaign-finance reform is
like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bonnie</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clyde</ENAMEX> calling for bank regulations.''

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> reports that national security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandy Berger</ENAMEX> said
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> and its <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">allies</ENAMEX> must be prepared for an extended stay
in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bosnia</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> says the comments were designed to counter congressional
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> who want to cut off spending for the mission, and to calm the fears
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">allies</ENAMEX>, who don't want to station their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bosnia</ENAMEX> without ours.
Uncompleted tasks <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX> mentioned include supervision of the repatriation of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">refugees</ENAMEX> and the apprehension of war <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">criminals</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> 's lead feature reveals plans by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toyota</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Honda</ENAMEX> to expand their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly operations</ENAMEX>. The paper points out
that such moves help insulate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> from currency fluctuations, exempt
them from tariffs, and help in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> domestic politics because they create
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> jobs.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> reports that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> have just agreed formally to
expand their security <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">alliance</ENAMEX>, resulting in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>'s highest military profile
in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX> since <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War</ENAMEX> II. The new defense guidelines, announced formally in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madeleine Albright</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William S.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cohen</ENAMEX> and their <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterparts</ENAMEX>, mean that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> would, for the first
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> since the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific</ENAMEX> war, engage in military activities outside its borders
in conflicts involving the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> The activities would, however, be primarily
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">logistic</ENAMEX> rather than active fighting.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> reports that a surprising <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witness</ENAMEX> appeared before a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYC City</ENAMEX>
Council hearing on police reform: former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYPD</ENAMEX> whistleblowing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cop</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Serpico</ENAMEX>,
who called for an independent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> monitoring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> to investigate police
wrongdoing and "create an atmosphere where the crooked <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cop</ENAMEX> fears the honest
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cop</ENAMEX>, and not the other way around."

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> media column points out that coverage of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marv Albert</ENAMEX> trial
seems to be filling journalism's OJ void. For everybody, except, the column
reports, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Enquirer</ENAMEX> . The tab's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> is quoted as saying,
"We've left it to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> to cover."
