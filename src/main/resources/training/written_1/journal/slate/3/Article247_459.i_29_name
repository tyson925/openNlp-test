            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA Today</ENAMEX> ,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX>
all lead with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> situation. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>
Times goes with the latest changes in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Colombian</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug cartels</ENAMEX>, which nowadays do business with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mafia</ENAMEX>, and avoid
giving a big cut to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">distributors</ENAMEX> by relying more on "mules" coming
directly to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> and less on <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX>. This change is possible, says
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> , because the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Colombian</ENAMEX> trade has shifted towards <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">heroin</ENAMEX>, which
is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> times more valuable by weight than <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocaine</ENAMEX>, and hence needn't be
shipped in the same quantities.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAT</ENAMEX> reports that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> is seeking to broaden support for
military action against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> emphasizes diplomacy too, stating
that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> sent signals it did not want a military confrontation with
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>, and that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> had persuaded <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> to have a go at pressing
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hussein</ENAMEX> diplomatically to back down. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> refers to an official
Iraqi dispatch stating that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam</ENAMEX> is not seeking a confrontation with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> also quotes a senior <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> saying, "When we feel we've
exhausted all diplomatic options, you'll know it."

            Many of the same diplomatic details are mentioned in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> story,
but it instead emphasizes the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>'s making the case for
military action by graphically depicting the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Iraqi</ENAMEX> threat, quoting senior
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> talking about the amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">anthrax</ENAMEX> and nerve gas <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hussein</ENAMEX> has. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAT</ENAMEX> has some of this too, but puts it at the bottom and doesn't
headline it.

            Both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> have the same front-page picture of
mega-hatted <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madeleine Albright</ENAMEX>--who spent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> shuttling between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arab</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> trying to drum up anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hussein</ENAMEX> support. Apparently, now whenever
she's in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Middle East</ENAMEX>, she carries a complete <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-</ENAMEX>chemical, anti-biological
warfare system on top of her head.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAT</ENAMEX> each carry front-page stories
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about just</NUMEX>-released <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dissident</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wei Jingshang</ENAMEX>, now hospitalized in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Detroit</ENAMEX>. But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> puts the story inside.

            In the wake of a similar story <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> , the USAT
news section cover story details how local <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> are scheming to
legally sidestep <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Prop. 209</ENAMEX>. "We're going to stretch the envelope as far as we
can and chip away at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">209</NUMEX>," is the word in the story from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nate Miley</ENAMEX>, city
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">councilman</ENAMEX> and vice <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mayor</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oakland</ENAMEX>.

            A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> editorial makes the point that
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">press</ENAMEX> consistently overlooks that some of the most thoughtful reassessments
of affirmative action come from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal</ENAMEX> notes, for instance,
that a data base search of newspaper coverage of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Lann Lee</ENAMEX> nomination
fight reveals that not <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> article interviewed or even quoted <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ward Conerly</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howard Kurtz</ENAMEX>, in his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> media column, reports that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Brock</ENAMEX>, the
darling of the rabid right when he went after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anita Hill</ENAMEX> in his first book, but
who then fell out of favor when he didn't do a similar number on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> in his <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> one, has been fired from his staff <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> job at the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Spectator</ENAMEX> .

            The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> had a piece that came as quite a shock to the huge
numbers of those who bought cell phones for their <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> primarily as an
emergency communications device--in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> at least, the phones aren't very
reliable at reaching anybody when you dial 911.

            And a full-page ad in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sunday NYT</ENAMEX> introduced a truly frightening
phenomenon: The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ralph Lauren</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Barbie</ENAMEX> doll. "She's the most sophisticated <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Barbie</ENAMEX>
ever, a perfect model of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ralph Lauren</ENAMEX> style, with long brown <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hair</ENAMEX>, a crested
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">navy blazer</ENAMEX>, navy knit turtleneck bodysuit, grey flannel pleat-front pants and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">lined camel-</ENAMEX>hair overcoat--plus the perfect accessories." What's next: Versace
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ken</ENAMEX>?
