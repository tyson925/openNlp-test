               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> and the New York
Times lead with the continuing furor over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX>
videos. The top story at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> is a major espionage arrest. And the
national lead at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los Angeles Times</ENAMEX> is the awarding of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Nobel Prize</ENAMEX> in
Medicine.

            What's driving the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> videos story forward is the news (first
reported by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX>) that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> is now admitting
there are still more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX> tapes. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAT</ENAMEX> reports that campaign finance
hearing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fred Thompson</ENAMEX> calls this episode a deliberate effort to
"delay and obstruct." The paper quotes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lanny Davis</ENAMEX> as
saying the omission was "an honest overlooking of materials." And, says
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAT</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> couldn't reach anyone at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX> on
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> to discuss the tape issue because it was a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> holiday. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> has this explanation as well. (Question: Is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Janet Reno Orthodox</ENAMEX> or
is she merely <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reform</ENAMEX> and hence could have lifted the receiver if she'd been
called at home?)

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> tapes story runs next to a picture from one of the videos
showing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> with a bunch of unidentified <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, presumably fat
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX>. Question: If, as we're told, these films were shot by the military office
in charge of archiving such <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> events, wouldn't those names be
recorded somewhere? And if so, isn't not making them available along with the
videotapes a clear case of stonewalling?

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> spy story, which also is on the front at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAT</ENAMEX> ,
departs somewhat from the pattern of recent espionage cases. For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> thing, the
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> accused of long-term spying for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East Germany</ENAMEX> are said by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> to have
acted out of ideological rather than material motives. For another, one of the
ring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> had once held a somewhat high-level <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> job (and even, says
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> , applied for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> job.) The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX>' headlines reflect
these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> strands of the story. USAT : "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Attorney</ENAMEX> Among Those
Arrested on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Espionage Charges</ENAMEX>." WP : "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Onetime Campus Radicals Held in Spy</ENAMEX>
Case." Both will get plenty of attention in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the days</TIMEX> ahead.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> continues to work a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinton</ENAMEX> fund-raising scandal it broke and
still has all to itself: the news that a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991 10-day</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asian</ENAMEX> trip taken by
then-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DNC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ron Brown</ENAMEX> was designed to raise funds for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DNC</ENAMEX> from
foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lobbyists</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX>'s story focuses on a memo written to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brown</ENAMEX> by a party <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aide</ENAMEX> pitching the trip, which contains such tidbits as that
"<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Huang</ENAMEX> has offered to host an event in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong King</ENAMEX> with a goal of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$50,000</NUMEX>,"
and "if we take the trip as proposed, we will raise <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">at least $100,000</NUMEX>."

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> reports that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys general</ENAMEX> from
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Connecticut</ENAMEX> have joined the antitrust
probe into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> already occupying <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Massachusetts</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>. The paper
reports that the focus of the investigation is whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> is trying to
prevent personal computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturers</ENAMEX> from shipping new machines loaded with
the Windows operating system from also being factory loaded with any non-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MS</ENAMEX>
Internet browser. State law <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> have become emboldened in the matter, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal</ENAMEX> says, by the recent <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX>-state tobacco settlement.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> front reports that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Benjamin Netanyahu</ENAMEX> has put up a defiant
defense of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israeli</ENAMEX> assassination attempt against a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hamas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX>, saying, "I
take the responsibility on myself." There's also a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> editorial today
calling for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israeli</ENAMEX> to foreswear assassination as a policy tool. But
responsibility was the last thing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Netanyahu</ENAMEX> was hoping to take, and his goal
was far more than assassination. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hamas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> was not shot (and the agents
were close enough to have done that) nor taken to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> to stand trial.
Instead the plan was for the target to get sick and die when the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israelis</ENAMEX> were
long gone. None of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX> seem to have noticed that what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Netanyahu</ENAMEX> wanted
was the result without the responsibility.

            
               Some conditions improved immediately. According to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WSJ</ENAMEX> ,
Former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Labor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lynn Martin</ENAMEX>, hired by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitsubishi</ENAMEX> to improve plant
conditions for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, says in a deposition that she is being paid <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2.2 million</NUMEX>
for her work.
