            The cover editorial and a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48</NUMEX>-page survey of the world economy
reject the conventional wisdom that the era of big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> is over. The
share of government spending in the gross domestic product of industrial
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> has risen steadily throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the century</TIMEX>, up to the current <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46</NUMEX>
percent. Exceptions: <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Singapore</ENAMEX>, which got rich with small
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bureaucracies</ENAMEX>. A story on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Weld</ENAMEX>'s blocked nomination blames not <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesse Helms</ENAMEX>
("now in his <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX> rumbustious term") but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> itself. Archaic rules let
one passionate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senator</ENAMEX> win out over reasoned argument. Also, an article says
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>'s new military cuts are in troop size, not spending. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>, like most of
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Asia</ENAMEX>, seeks high-tech weaponry.

            One
reason <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Republic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Kelly</ENAMEX> was fired is that his "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">TRB</ENAMEX>"
columns were too tough on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Gore</ENAMEX>. But <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TRB</ENAMEX>, headlined "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Impeach</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX>," is not as harsh as it seems. It argues that an independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">counsel</ENAMEX> lets
both sides hide behind legal technicalities. Impeachment hearings would never
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">oust Gore</ENAMEX>, but they would reveal the truth. The cover story on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Sweeney</ENAMEX>
advises the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AFL-CIO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> to be more militant. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sweeney</ENAMEX> is too often

relevant, labor must take risks and build its membership (current growth rate:
less than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2 percent</NUMEX> per year). Also, an article says <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">right-wingers</ENAMEX> are becoming
socially conscious, establishing conservative-minded mutual funds and
boycotting products. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cheerios</ENAMEX> are out: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Mills</ENAMEX> gives to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Planned</ENAMEX>

            The cover
story on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harold Ickes</ENAMEX> compares the former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aide</ENAMEX> to his FDR-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aide father</ENAMEX>.
Each <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ickes</ENAMEX> kept absurdly copious notes, and was doggedly loyal to his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boss</ENAMEX>.
Despite the fact that he was dismissed and abandoned by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>, and despite
the fact that he turned his notes over to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thompson</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committee</ENAMEX>, the younger
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ickes</ENAMEX> maintains "unshakable" faith in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>. An article on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oliver Stone</ENAMEX> says
he has eschewed political diatribe in his forthcoming film U-Turn and
his planned sequel to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mission</ENAMEX>: Impossible . Instead, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stone</ENAMEX> seeks
mainstream clout. Also, a story refutes the notion that learning-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">disabled kids</ENAMEX>
get too much attention. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Schools</ENAMEX> that are looking for places to save money are
tossing most LD-diagnosed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> into regular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX>, where they are not
assigned the rote drills they need if they are to learn how to read.
