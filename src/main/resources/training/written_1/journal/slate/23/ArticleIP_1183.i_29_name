            Last
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Republic</ENAMEX> declared that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX> is "dying." <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">This week</TIMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Economist</ENAMEX> says that it is "emerging." The cheerful cover story and
editorial observe that economies are growing across <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">sub-Saharan Africa</ENAMEX>, commend
the tough fiscal and free-market policies of new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX>, and urge the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> to lift tariffs on <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> exports. There's a bit of bad
news, too. An essay by development-economics <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guru</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeffrey Sachs</ENAMEX> rates the
importance of geography and climate to economic growth: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tropical</ENAMEX> regions (e.g.,
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Africa</ENAMEX>) are enormously handicapped by their high rates of infectious disease
and their low soil fertility. An <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>-page survey predicts the globalization of
the defense industry. Only international megacontractors such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> have
the economies of scale necessary to build expensive high-tech <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX>. It also
notes that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>'s defense industry is more primitive than recent publicity
suggests.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">son James</ENAMEX> is the boldest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">thinker</ENAMEX>. The cover story gushes about gay divorc√©e

            The cover

Instead of finding scapegoats, they now encourage <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurses</ENAMEX> to admit
mistakes (no punishment attached) in order to prevent future ones. Problem:

before <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Native Americans</ENAMEX>, who migrated from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Native Americans</ENAMEX> insist that

they may be ineffective.

            Computer
databases make too much data available too easily, so the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> must
intervene to protect Internet privacy, argues the cover

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX>, see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate</ENAMEX>'s "Such a
