            <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>'s
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">50 th</NUMEX> birthday is celebrated, ambivalently, as the cover package praises the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>'s democracy and condemns
its history of socialism. Recent economic liberalization has started to improve
living standards, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> urge the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> to privatize and
deregulate faster. A piece commends <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madeleine Albright</ENAMEX> for her "splendid
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bluntness</ENAMEX>" and her belief that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> must act as the world's moral
(and actual) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">policeman</ENAMEX>. But even she may not be able to force peace on the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Middle East</ENAMEX>. Also, an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Economist</ENAMEX> obsession: The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> advises <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>
to legalize <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>, at least marijuana and ecstasy (MDMA). A related article
describes, lovingly, the many medical benefits of pot smoking.

            The cover
story marvels at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lanny Davis</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> who does spin control for
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> campaign-finance investigation. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>'s "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minister</ENAMEX> for
scandal," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Davis</ENAMEX> brilliantly defused the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thompson</ENAMEX> hearings by convincing
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witnesses</ENAMEX>' testimony was old news. "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heil Harvard</ENAMEX>" describes
how <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Austria</ENAMEX>'s far-right <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX>, the repellent <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jorg Haider</ENAMEX>, is polishing his
reputation by attending <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard</ENAMEX> conferences and schmoozing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX>. Haider, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> reminds us, praised the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SS</ENAMEX> and has proposed
expelling all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreigners</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Austria</ENAMEX>. A biography of efficiency
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">expert Frederick Winslow Taylor</ENAMEX> is reviewed. The conclusion: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Taylor</ENAMEX> was a
terrible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>, and he should be blamed for the dehumanization of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
workplace.

            An
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">article</ENAMEX> calls <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> primary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> the best in the world. Why? <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Kids</ENAMEX>
cooperate on everything, are encouraged to think creatively, and learn
responsibility from chores. (They clean the school <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> because there are

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> undo the primary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>' good work. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> interviews <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">CEO</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philip Condit</ENAMEX>, who defends the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>'s safety record, its acquisition of

likens the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rodney King</ENAMEX> beating to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Tiananmen Square</ENAMEX> massacre. The cover

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple-Microsoft</ENAMEX> deal
takes both covers. The shared conclusion is that the agreement is a win-win:
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX> buys some needed time, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> locks up the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macintosh</ENAMEX> applications
market and wards off antitrust <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> 's behind-the-scenes package follows <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Jobs</ENAMEX> through the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week</TIMEX> leading up to the fateful speech. Funniest moment: When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gates</ENAMEX> asks <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jobs</ENAMEX>
what he should wear during the announcement, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jobs</ENAMEX> answers, a white shirt.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek</ENAMEX> publishes a short interview with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jobs</ENAMEX>, who says that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX> will
concentrate on the education and "creative content" markets. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek</ENAMEX>
also argues that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX> will fail to hire a strong <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">CEO</ENAMEX> because nobody wants to
work in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jobs</ENAMEX>' shadow.

            Both newsweeklies celebrate

privatized services, challenged employee <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unions</ENAMEX>, and supported school vouchers.
Singled out for praise: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Goldsmith</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indianapolis</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Norquist</ENAMEX> of
