            The
cover editorial cheers the ascendancy of democracy and the free
market in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latin America</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> is now an equal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX>, not a dependent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cousin</ENAMEX>. The editorial predicts a hemisphere-wide
free-trade region within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20 years</TIMEX>. A piece
pegged to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tuskegee</ENAMEX> apology insists that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> improve its
rules for scientific research on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>: There are too many cases where
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> don't really consent to experimental treatments. An article claims that sly telecom <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX> have figured out how to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">collude</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> spectrum auctions. The result: A recent auction raised <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">only $14</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">million</ENAMEX>--<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $1.7</NUMEX> 
               billion less than expected.

            The
mammoth cover essay denounces human cloning as morally repugnant. Among the
many objections cited are that cloning: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) dehumanizes procreation by
separating it from sex and love; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) commodifies <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) distorts
relationships between "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>" and "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>"; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) denies <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> their own
identity; and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>) turns <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> into slaves of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>. The author
rejects the technological determinists who say that because human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cloning</ENAMEX> is
possible, it should be done. Also, an article contends that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tony Blair</ENAMEX>'s
legislative proposals (to adopt a bill of rights, abolish hereditary rights in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House of Lords</ENAMEX>, impose proportional representation, assign interest-rate
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> to a central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX>, and establish parliaments for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Scotland</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wales</ENAMEX>)
will change <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> as much as Thatcherism did.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">photography</ENAMEX> (pictures that show models <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">warts</ENAMEX> and all). Another describes
Corbis, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Gates</ENAMEX>' digital photo archive: It's not making much money because
the market for digital images is growing so slowly.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek</ENAMEX> answers its own cover line with an optimistic "yes." A poll of
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> finds them sanguine about the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>'s future. An <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX>
lists <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> factors for worried <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> to watch. Chief among them:
Will <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> preserve the rule of law and free speech, which are essential for
business prosperity? <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven Spielberg</ENAMEX> takes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> 's cover as he ends a
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three-year</TIMEX> absence from the screen with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> new movies, including <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Lost</ENAMEX>
World , a sequel to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jurassic Park</ENAMEX> . The article concludes the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spielberg</ENAMEX> has grown up since <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">E.T.</ENAMEX> , but not too much: He's

               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek</ENAMEX> describes
the controversy over sex-corrective surgery for "intersexual" <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">babies</ENAMEX>--<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
born with the wrong--or incomplete--sex organs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Doctors</ENAMEX> have given a generation
of such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> "normal" sex organs (i.e., they have transformed boys'
incomplete penises into vaginas, then treated the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with female
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hormones</ENAMEX>). Now the intersexuals are fighting back, arguing that the surgery
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inflicts</ENAMEX> vast physical and psychological damage. A story chronicles Fidelity
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Investments</ENAMEX>' continuing troubles. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fidelity</ENAMEX>'s funds are lagging and the best
fund <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> are leaving, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX> is thriving as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> of corporate

            Also in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> , a package of stories celebrates <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> prosperity, saying that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> is in better shape than it's been in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX>: The economy is humming,
crime and divorce rates are falling, etc. An article warns that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> is
losing control of its nuclear weapons: Its early warning system is
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">disintegrating</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX> who man the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missiles</ENAMEX> aren't being paid, raising

his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX> financial collapse, though he exaggerates his wealth. He is now
divorcing his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Marla</ENAMEX>, largely because under the terms of their prenuptial

<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX> because they have more genetic variability: According to statistical
laws, more variability means that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> are disproportionately represented
among both the best and the worst <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">athletes</ENAMEX>. A piece says that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Timothy McVeigh</ENAMEX>'s

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> that really need funds. Also, Arianna
