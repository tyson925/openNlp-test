            The
cover editorial takes a dim view of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>'s giddy stock
market. In order to justify <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s stratospheric share prices, profits and
productivity must grow at improbably high rates for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">an impossibly long time</TIMEX>.
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">For Slate</ENAMEX>'s similarly pessimistic take, see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Kinsley</ENAMEX>'s "The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stock Market</ENAMEX>
Chicken-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Counting Orgy</ENAMEX>.") A related article notes that the skyrocketing stock market is
a worldwide phenomenon: Equity markets are booming in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX>, too,
thanks to low interest rates. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Economist</ENAMEX> celebrates the
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">th</ENAMEX> birthday of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX>, the world's first synthetic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> and
still one of the best. Latest bit of good news: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aspirin</ENAMEX> now seems to prevent
<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">bowel cancer</ENAMEX>, in addition to relieving pain, quelling inflammation, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">preventing strokes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart attacks</ENAMEX>.

            The cover
story deplores the overdiagnosis of learning disabilities: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocates</ENAMEX> say
that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as many as 50 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> are learning-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">disabled</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> say that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> claim impairment to extract special treatment from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> (extra
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tutoring</ENAMEX>, extra time on tests, etc.). The disabilities include such dubious
afflictions as "dysgraphia"--that is, bad handwriting. A piece argues that
black <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> espouse paranoid myths (that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> sells crack in the inner
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>, for example) because it's easier for them to believe that white <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>
is trying to destroy them than to believe that white <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> doesn't care about
them. The "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">TRB"</ENAMEX> column suggests that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Weld</ENAMEX> could revive the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Republican</ENAMEX>
Party and position himself as a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> presidential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contender</ENAMEX> by fighting Jesse
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helms</ENAMEX> over <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weld</ENAMEX>'s nomination as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ambassador</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">For Slate</ENAMEX>'s less
