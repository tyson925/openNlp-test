            <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>
retains an unhealthy attachment to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mao</ENAMEX>, argues the cover story. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Great</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Helmsman</ENAMEX> is still widely revered; his crimes have been forgotten; and his
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">muscular</ENAMEX>, anti-Western brand of nationalism is making a comeback. Also, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Newt</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gingrich</ENAMEX>'s dilemma: Echoing a recent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek</ENAMEX> article, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNR</ENAMEX> claims
that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gingrich</ENAMEX> hasn't paid his <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$300,000</NUMEX> ethics fine because he fears his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>
might leave him if he uses their savings to clear the debt. If, on the other
hand, he pays the fine with campaign funds, the political backlash would almost
certainly cost him the speakership. In Heaven's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gate</ENAMEX> news, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">columnist</ENAMEX> writes
sympathetically about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cult</ENAMEX>'s theology: "What is a cult but a collection of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">believers</ENAMEX>, like the early <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christians</ENAMEX>, who have not yet achieved dominant
status?" (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">For Slate</ENAMEX>'s similar take, see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter Kirn</ENAMEX>'s "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Heaven Can't</ENAMEX>
Wait.")

            The
cover editorial regrets the collapse of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Republican revolution</ENAMEX>.
Fearful of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voter</ENAMEX> backlash, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GOP</ENAMEX> has become "a sad collection of drifters,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bickerers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX> manqu√©s ." With the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GOP</ENAMEX> going soft, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> will
retreat from necessary deficit-reduction and entitlement reform. A related
story says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Newt Gingrich</ENAMEX> was right to postpone tax cuts and does not
deserve the blame that's being heaped upon him.

            The
opening feature in a special issue devoted to "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Store</ENAMEX>" asserts that the

            The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> newsmagazines
reconstruct the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Heaven's Gate</ENAMEX> suicide, trace the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cult</ENAMEX>'s history, and link it to
burgeoning New Age spiritualism. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek</ENAMEX> 's meaty package explains
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Heaven</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Gate</ENAMEX>'s daft cosmology and catalogs <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>'s other doomsday sects.
(The weirdest is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Brotherhood</ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oregon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cult</ENAMEX> that eats garbage.)
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek</ENAMEX> also hints that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> Heaven's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>--the "ground

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marshall Applewhite</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bonnie Lu Nettles</ENAMEX> (then "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bo</ENAMEX>" and "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Peep"</ENAMEX>). A <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
News column describes the attractions of cults, and compares the

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> agree that the Internet was an ineffective <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cult</ENAMEX>-recruiting tool,
and certainly not the cause of the suicides.

            Also, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> reports

<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX>. An article says that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GOP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Reps.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dick Armey</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bill</ENAMEX>

these principles will combine liberalism and communitarianism: "a right to a
