            The
cover story and editorial conclude, albeit unenthusiastically, that morality and
human rights have a place in foreign policy. Outside pressure often civilizes
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">undemocratic</ENAMEX>, inhumane <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nations</ENAMEX> (i.e., <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Africa</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Soviet Union</ENAMEX>). But
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Economist</ENAMEX> is uncertain whether <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Western</ENAMEX> pressure can persuade <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>
to mend its ways. A gloomy
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">article</ENAMEX> details the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">obstacles</ENAMEX> that will face <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Zairian</ENAMEX> rebel <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laurent</ENAMEX>

piece on biological weapons cautions that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> still has them;
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) they are easy to hide; and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) they are phenomenally dangerous.

<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> hesitate to dump <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Newt Gingrich</ENAMEX> because his potential successors
would be worse, argues the cover story, "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Men Who Would Be Newt</ENAMEX>." Each of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heirs</ENAMEX> apparent is
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dissected</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dick Armey</ENAMEX> is too dull, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom DeLay</ENAMEX> is too volatile, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Boehner</ENAMEX> is
too treacherous. All are too conservative. An article about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Labor</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary-designate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexis Herman</ENAMEX> labels her the "least-qualified--and certainly most

confirmation because <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> prefer an ineffective labor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX> to a
fighter like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Reich</ENAMEX>. An article lambastes medical ethicists for being ill-trained. The most
damaging claim: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HMOs</ENAMEX> hire <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ethicists</ENAMEX> who then justify the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HMOs</ENAMEX>' decisions to
deny expensive treatment. Also, a piece claims that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jerusalem</ENAMEX> is not really a
holy <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Islam</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslims</ENAMEX> claim it only to score political points off
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX>.

            The cover

the "harvesting" of her new heart to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX> itself. (The highlight is a

               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> scoops
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ellen DeGeneres</ENAMEX>. Both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazines</ENAMEX> report that her sitcom

("<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Now</ENAMEX> I feel comfortable with myself and I don't have to be fearful about

TV coming out is a milestone because it's the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time a show will have a

but a concoction of lemonade, cayenne, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">maple syrup</ENAMEX>; they communicated with
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cult leader</ENAMEX> only in writing; they were not allowed to have their own

suicide <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">as long ago as 1994</TIMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> has put up a new Heaven's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gate</ENAMEX>
Web page containing messages from the "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Away Team"</ENAMEX> (the suicides). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX>

               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> warns that

how to get into them. The cover

<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX>; being an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alum</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX> does not guarantee admission. Also, an article illustrates the influence that political donations can

given <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$300 billion</NUMEX> worth of new licenses for nothing. Credit-card <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>,
also big <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX>, blocked legislation that would lower late fees. A story claims that the illegal-immigrant-smuggling business is

            "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">American</ENAMEX>

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> bigwigs, used these political ties to buy an <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oklahoma</ENAMEX> gas
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>, and earned a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$9 million</NUMEX> profit on the deal without lifting a finger.
The conclusion: All this was sleazy but probably legal. A warm profile of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">playwright Wendy Wasserstein</ENAMEX>, whose new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Broadway</ENAMEX> play opens <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this month</TIMEX>, depicts
her as an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">establishment figure</ENAMEX> who still thinks of herself as an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">outsider</ENAMEX>.
