            The
cover story criticizes <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>'s favorite <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> prevention
program, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drug Abuse Resistance Education</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX> behind <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DARE</ENAMEX>, TNR
says, suppress studies showing that it doesn't work and harass <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">academics</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalists</ENAMEX> who criticize it. An editorial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">slams</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s budget for papering over the
entitlement crisis with "rosy scenarios." An article asserts that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> are supporting the budget in
exchange for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s acquiescence to a capital-gains tax cut. The "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">TRB"</ENAMEX> column calls for the appointment of an independent counsel
to investigate the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democratic</ENAMEX> fund-raising scandal. And <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Brustein</ENAMEX>
continues his brawl with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">August Wilson</ENAMEX> over race and theater.

            The
cover story and an editorial predict trouble for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helmut Kohl</ENAMEX>,
who's presiding over a weakening <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> economy. An article suggests that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> economy's troubles might
postpone the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> currency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">union</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madeleine Albright</ENAMEX>
contributes an article about why <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX> should expand into <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eastern Europe</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan Coats</ENAMEX>' idea of a tax credit for anti-poverty <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">charities</ENAMEX> wins the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX>'s
praise. And a long article summarizes research on circadian
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rhythms</ENAMEX>. Most interesting fact: <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">City</ENAMEX>-dwelling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> lose the ability to adapt
to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seasons</TIMEX>. They don't sleep longer in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> than they do in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX>, but they
should.

            The
smuggling of exotic and endangered <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> takes the cover. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madagascar</ENAMEX> and
elsewhere, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">snakes</ENAMEX>, primates, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">turtles</ENAMEX> are being destroyed by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locals</ENAMEX>. The First World is blamed: A <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">turtle</ENAMEX> worth <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">30 cents</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madagascar</ENAMEX> can
fetch <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$10,000</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. Also, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Garry Wills</ENAMEX> says
multiculturalism, not conservatism, is fueling the revival of classical
literature. "The ancient texts have become eerily modern in what they have to
say about power relationships between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, gay <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and war, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">superiors</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subordinates</ENAMEX>." And the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> visits <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actress</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vanessa Redgrave</ENAMEX>,
who is more self-righteous and obsessive than ever about her causes. She's keen

               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O.J.</ENAMEX> cover goes inside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brown/Goldman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camp</ENAMEX>, revealing
evidence that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">plaintiffs</ENAMEX> didn't use, including a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witness</ENAMEX> who saw <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O.J.</ENAMEX>
demonstrate how to kill someone with a knife. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fred Goldman</ENAMEX> says he doesn't care
about the money, only about the vindication. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek</ENAMEX> 's cover considers
"The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O.J. Legacy</ENAMEX>," predicting that he will keep custody of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> but lose
his appeal of the civil decision. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">columnist</ENAMEX> says that the
case did not divide <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX>; it merely revealed a breach that already
existed.

theory.

            Also in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> , a

               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek</ENAMEX> sings the praises of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michelle Kwan</ENAMEX>, "<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>'s next great
figure-skating <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">queen</ENAMEX>." And an article tries to explain why the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Euro</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>'s

            The
cover story excerpts <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Confessions of a Spy</ENAMEX> , a new book
about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aldrich Ames</ENAMEX>, calling the convicted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spy</ENAMEX> the "most destructive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traitor</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> history." The piece claims that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ames</ENAMEX> exposed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> assets" to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KGB</ENAMEX>--more than twice as many as had been reported. He also crippled <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozens</NUMEX> of
covert operations, including a wiretap on a private communication line in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KGB</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX>. Also, an article demystifies love (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">just</NUMEX> in time for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Valentine</TIMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Day</ENAMEX>), explaining that a chemical called oxytocin, triggered by breast-feeding,
makes <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> love their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mates</ENAMEX>. (To learn more about familial love

<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">article</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whitewater</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Stewart</ENAMEX> examines <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Susan McDougal</ENAMEX>'s
refusal to cooperate with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth Starr</ENAMEX>'s investigation. She says she won't
testify because <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX> is engaged in a political witch hunt; the piece

A story describes the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Indian</ENAMEX> island of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montserrat</ENAMEX>, where a long-dormant
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">volcano</ENAMEX> is threatening to erupt. If it does, it will probably bury the island
(and the few <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousand</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhabitants</ENAMEX> who remain) in lava and ash. Also, an article
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">praises House Budget Committee</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Kasich</ENAMEX> as one of few <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX>
brave enough to offend big business for the sake of a balanced budget.

            The conservative magazines
savage the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Bar Association</ENAMEX> as a tool of big-government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">liberals</ENAMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Nearly</NUMEX> identical articles condemn the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABA</ENAMEX>'s recent endorsement of a
death-penalty moratorium and denounce the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABA</ENAMEX>'s judicial rating system for its
left-wing bias. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Standard</ENAMEX> 's cover story, "The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Truth</ENAMEX> vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry Flynt</ENAMEX>,"
echoes similar pieces in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Republic</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Nation</ENAMEX> by
arguing that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Flynt</ENAMEX> is much scummier than his movie persona. The piece does

allegedly admits telling his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> to strip so he could look at

"macho bullshit" integral to military culture.
