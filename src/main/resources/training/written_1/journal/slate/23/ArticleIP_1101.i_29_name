               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek</ENAMEX> 's cover story predicts a recession. The failure of so many foreign
economies will soon hurt <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>, crushing both the stock market and consumer
confidence. Higher unemployment may follow. Remedies: The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Reserve Board</ENAMEX>
must drastically cut interest rates, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Monetary Fund</ENAMEX> must
continue to aid foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> must reform its banking system.

               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> 's cover package: a week in the life of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>. Following
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurses</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">administrators</ENAMEX> around the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Duke Medical Center</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX>
offers vignettes of modern hospital life. General theme: It's hard to balance
belt tightening and effective health care.

            

               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tabloids</ENAMEX> such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Enquirer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Globe</ENAMEX>
are losing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX>. Why? "Mainstream" <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> have taken over their turf by
covering <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Princess</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Di</ENAMEX>'s death, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Flytrap</ENAMEX>, and other tablike stories. Tabloids are
now more prudish than network television, refusing to discuss the specifics of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Flytrap</ENAMEX> sex acts. (To read

            The
cover story says <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> have been in the New World for much
longer than previously assumed. "Clovis-first" theories (named for an
archaeological site in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX>), which hold that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> appeared here about
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12,000 years ago</TIMEX>, have been supplanted by evidence of seaside <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chile</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific Northwest</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30,000</NUMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more years ago</TIMEX>. ... A story exposes a wave of kidnappings in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Small-town Chinese</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> who migrate to bigger <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> for work are often shanghaied at the train
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">station</ENAMEX>. Sold to "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husbands</ENAMEX>" for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a few hundred dollars</NUMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> spend <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> as
captive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">breeders</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> is only now cracking down on the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trade</ENAMEX>.

            More
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">celebrity writers</ENAMEX> praise <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> and bash <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth Starr</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">E.L.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Doctorow</ENAMEX> compares <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph McCarthy</ENAMEX>: "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX> has shown us how a
conscienceless, ideologically vindictive use of the investigative privilege can
undercut the legitimacy of any duly elected <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>." <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bobbie Ann</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mason</ENAMEX> claims, "[<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX>]e eviscerated the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> because a middle-aged
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man dallied</ENAMEX> with a young, willing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> and then tried to hush it up." <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Styron</ENAMEX> argues that "a complicity between the public and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> has generated
an ignoble voyeurism so pervasive that we have never permitted a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> like
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Clinton</ENAMEX> to proclaim with fury that his sex life, past and present, is
nobody's business but his own." ... A story describes the breakthrough
period of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Muhammad Ali</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ali</ENAMEX> (then <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cassius Clay</ENAMEX>) created his persona knowingly
and from nothing, and his defeat of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sonny Liston</ENAMEX> marked a turnaround in our
culture. Older sports <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fans</ENAMEX> hated the brash, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">loudmouthed</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clay</ENAMEX>; younger ones knew
he was a revolutionary.

               The 
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nation</ENAMEX> 's cover story proposes a "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX> holiday," <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Ã  la FDR</ENAMEX>, to pre-empt
further catastrophe in the global economy. Among proposals: close <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX> for one
day to allow them to reorganize; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institute</ENAMEX> emergency tax cuts; sack the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMF</ENAMEX>'s
failed leadership; and place emergency controls on capital flows. A related
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">article</ENAMEX> says that all <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nations</ENAMEX> can't emulate the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, so
it was a given that capitalism as a single global paradigm would fail. Thus,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> should reverse its "imperial laissez-faire" policies and take
an active hand in the global economy.
