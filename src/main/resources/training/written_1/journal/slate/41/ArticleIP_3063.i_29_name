            There is simply to the
influence the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Octavio Paz</ENAMEX> enjoyed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>. I lived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico City</ENAMEX> from
the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fall of 1989 through the following spring</TIMEX>. Those were <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">heady days</TIMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paz</ENAMEX>.
For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, he had challenged the uncritical left-wing rhetoric that dominated
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>'s intellectual life, and now <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eastern Europe</ENAMEX>'s abandonment of communism
was proving him correct. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carlos Salinas de Gortari</ENAMEX> was renegotiating
the national debt, getting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreigners</ENAMEX> to invest again, and in general becoming
an international darling (this was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four years</TIMEX> before he would be unmasked as a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">criminal</ENAMEX> and thrown out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>). Paz was one of his biggest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fans</ENAMEX>.

            I
remember a TV commercial that seemed to appear every <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three seconds</TIMEX>. (At this
point there was still for all practical purposes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> network, owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Emilio</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Azcárraga</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rupert Murdoch</ENAMEX> with whom <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paz</ENAMEX> was rumored to be friendly.)
The commercial advertised an exhibit at the contemporary art <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>. The show
was of, basically, things <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Octavio Paz</ENAMEX> found interesting. I looked in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the day</TIMEX>
before I left <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> and was fascinated and appalled. The first thing you saw
was a gallery of pre-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Colombian</ENAMEX> artifacts that had sparked his imagination.
There followed a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> hung exclusively with colonial-era portraits of Sor Juana
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Inés de la Cruz</ENAMEX>, the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17 th century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poet</ENAMEX> whose life <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paz</ENAMEX> told in a
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">superb 1982</ENAMEX> biography. And so it went, with <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> after room displaying whatever
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">caught Paz</ENAMEX>'s fancy. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">nook</ENAMEX> devoted to playful gewgaws by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marcel Duchamp</ENAMEX>, whom
Paz adored. A painting given to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paz</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jasper Johns</ENAMEX>. But the most amazing
feature of the exhibit was in the lobby: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Dozens</NUMEX> of TV <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">monitors</ENAMEX> were stacked to
create a giant image of the great <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> as he discoursed on this and that.
The whole thing looked like a homage to some ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emperor</ENAMEX>. It was a creepy,
discouraging display.

            An ironic <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>, too, given <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paz</ENAMEX>'s record as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critic</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>'s addiction to patriarchal power. All his life, he had seen the
temptations up close, and many times he had resisted. His <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandfather</ENAMEX>, a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">publisher</ENAMEX>, was allied with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the turn of the century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dictator</ENAMEX> whose highhanded
rule provoked the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Mexican revolution</ENAMEX>. Late in life he switched <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sides</ENAMEX> and took
up the doomed cause of liberal democracy. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paz</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> worked in turn with the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anarchist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peasant</ENAMEX> guerrilla <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Emiliano Zapata</ENAMEX>, who wanted <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> to return
to its pre-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanic</ENAMEX>, agricultural roots. When that cause, too, failed and,
after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a decade</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX>-spilling, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> ended up with a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Byzantine</ENAMEX>
coalition of interests presided over by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">strongman</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paz</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> went into
exile in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>. So before he was even a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teen-ager</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paz</ENAMEX> had experience in
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">liberalism</ENAMEX>, anarchism, revolution--not to mention the loneliness of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX> in inhospitable <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>.

            Enthralled
by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marx</ENAMEX> and socialism (even in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later years</TIMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foes</ENAMEX> called him conservative,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paz</ENAMEX> would insist he was a socialist at heart), the young <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paz</ENAMEX> went to fight
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Franco</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>. But it was the idea of instantaneous action by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that
he loved, not the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish Communists</ENAMEX>, with their rigid principles and ugly
totalitarian tendencies. He went to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> and hung out with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Surrealists</ENAMEX>,
deepening his sense that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX>'s job is to reveal what society tries to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">repress</ENAMEX>. Like many well-connected, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artistically</ENAMEX> inclined <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexicans</ENAMEX>, he got into
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cushy</ENAMEX> work that supplied living expenses and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> for the imagination:
diplomacy.

            It was while working as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diplomat</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> that he wrote
the book he'll be remembered by. In <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Labyrinth of Solitude: Life and</ENAMEX>
Thought in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paz</ENAMEX> drew on his reading of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Freud</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marx</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nietzsche</ENAMEX> to
explore the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cult</ENAMEX> of death, the phenomenon of the macho, and explosive
rituals such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">fiesta</ENAMEX>. His conclusion: <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> customs were a kind of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mask</ENAMEX>, a defensive camouflage worn to hide the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>'s unresolved past. "The
whole history of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>, from the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Conquest to the Revolution</ENAMEX>, can be regarded
as a search for our own selves, which have been deformed or disguised by alien
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX>," he wrote. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Revolutionary Institutional Party</ENAMEX> that took power
after the revolution had promised <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> a new beginning. But instead of
providing <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexicans</ENAMEX> with an idea they could organize a modern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX> around,
it was a touchy compromise that preserved backward attitudes toward power
leftover from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aztecs</ENAMEX> and colonial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>:

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patriarch</ENAMEX> protects, is
good, powerful, wise. The macho is the terrible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>, the chingon , the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> who has left, who has abandoned a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>. The image of
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">authority</ENAMEX> is inspired by these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> extremes: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Señor Presidente</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caudillo</ENAMEX>.

            Much of
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Labyrinth</ENAMEX> now feels dated. It's infused with a mournful <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1950s</NUMEX>-era
Existentialism, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paz</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> influence pushes him into abstraction. In
places, his indictment of certain aspects of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> character is so
harsh--he accuses his fellow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">countrymen</ENAMEX> of pathological passivity and a love of
lying--that it verges on masochism. But the book single-handedly invented the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> think about modern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>, and it has a tough truthfulness that's
still palpable <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>. Never academic, it proceeds from a simple, urgent
question: "What are we, and how can we fulfill our obligations to ourselves as
we are?" This is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poet</ENAMEX>'s or a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">philosopher</ENAMEX>'s approach to history that could
fruitfully be applied to any <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> in the world. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Click</ENAMEX> to see, for example,
how he applies it, with not very flattering results, to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>.)

            Paz cemented his reputation for integrity in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1968</TIMEX>, when the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> government murdered <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>, and he resigned his post as
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ambassador</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> in protest. But gradually, it has to be admitted, he came
to suffer a mild case of the very power sickness he had diagnosed. He set up a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">magazine, Vuelta</ENAMEX> , to pursue intellectual inquiry free of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX>
left's more overblown rhetoric. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> was and is serious and fresh and
distinguished. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paz</ENAMEX>'s omnipresence was sometimes unhealthy. From high up on
his throne, he conducted feuds with those--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carlos Fuentes</ENAMEX> was one--who
disagreed with him. For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX>, too much of what was published in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> was
written either in argument with him or to court his favor.

            That said,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paz</ENAMEX> could not have remained on top if he had not remained relevant. Some shrewd
inner compass and an unholy supply of curiosity saved him from becoming a relic
of the past or an embattled <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponent</ENAMEX> of the present. I won't argue for his
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">poetry</ENAMEX>, which, while frequently beautiful, is never quite as beautiful to me as
his prose. That is gentle and clear, yet so packed with suggestive ideas that
it is almost painful to read. While other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> struggled with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paz</ENAMEX>'s
definition of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> condition, he wrote about <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">calligraphy</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">haiku</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marquis de Sade</ENAMEX> ("an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enemy</ENAMEX> of love," yet paradoxically, a
generous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>), or obstacles to democracy in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> (he always thought there were
useful parallels between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>'s and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>'s struggles to set up a legitimate
government). In his life <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paz</ENAMEX> made himself invulnerable, but in his writing he
kept his eyes, ears, and heart open. "A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> should be a guerrilla <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">fighter</ENAMEX>,
should bear <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solitude</ENAMEX> and know that he is a marginal being," he once told an
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">interviewer</ENAMEX>. He never gave up this ideal of marginality, even as he climbed to
the top of the pyramid. He was a singular case, both admirable and disturbing:
the perennial guerrilla <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fighter</ENAMEX> who also became <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX>.
