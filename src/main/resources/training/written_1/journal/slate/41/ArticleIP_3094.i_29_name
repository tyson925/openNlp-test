            The bra is a keener pleasure
for being optional. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thirty years ago</TIMEX>, many items once necessary to female
life--bras and girdles, hats and gloves, formal hairstyles and conventional
makeup--were banished to the torture <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX> of the patriarchy. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> by one they
have all come back, licensed frivolities rather than slavish concessions to the
male beholder. Since they are subject to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>'s freedom of choice, many women
never make use of them, and that, too, has its own excitement.

            Of all
the old appurtenances, the bra was the only one that never really disappeared,
since some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> can't do without it. In fact, developments in bra construction
and embellishment speeded up when not wearing them became a natural right
instead of a questionable perversion and wearing them became a sensual
experience instead of a social duty. Now there are tough sports bras for active
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, cleverly minimizing bras for the very abundant, and scores of
confections with no function but to delight, whether on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> or in pictures.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wonderbra</ENAMEX> was a popular sensation <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of years ago</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madonna</ENAMEX> in her
Gaultier monstrosities was a showbiz sensation <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four years</TIMEX> before that. It's
clear that breasts well emphasized by artfully designed bras are thrilling to
all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sexes</ENAMEX> and ages, and there's nothing wrong with that. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Victoria</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Secret</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">catalogue</ENAMEX> makes a fine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">successor</ENAMEX> to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frederick</ENAMEX>'s of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX>.

            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">This year</TIMEX> we can also relish the flat-chested puberty look
of what used to be called a "training bra" and is now being worn as part of the
dress. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Designers</ENAMEX> are enclosing nearly nonexistent breasts in the familiar
bra-shape, then sliding a dress around it (attached with little rings), or over
it (so it shows through), or below it (sewn on, sometimes in a different
material). The more the bra seems like underwear, the sexier it is; when it's
more like a bikini top, the effect is simple modishness. In any case, though,
the idea is never to thrust actual breasts into actual prominence. It's a
reference only, a delicate allusion to that deeply satisfying modern icon, the
brassiere-clad bosom with its distinctively engineered shape.

            The
fetishism of female underwear dates, in its current incarnation, to the second
half of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last century</TIMEX>, before bras existed and when the prevailing
excitement was all about underpants. For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> had worn only
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">petticoats</ENAMEX>. The arrival of white, frilly panties caused a stir, especially
since many were "open drawers"--that is, pants made as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> separate knee-length
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">legs</ENAMEX>, hung on a single drawstring around the waist but with no fore-and-aft
crotch seam. The wicked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parisian</ENAMEX> cancan dates from this steamy epoch.

            
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">those days</TIMEX> a great divide separated
underwear from outerwear, so a glimpse of petticoat frill was a thrill. But
even more so were the lines of the figure created by the invisible corset
(think <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seurat</ENAMEX>), along with the knowledge of invisible underpants caressing
secret places with every rustling step.

            The bra
is an early <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20 th century</TIMEX> invention, born of a new ideal for the
female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> newly engaged in sports and gainful employment. This ideal had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> forthrightly celebrating female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">anatomy</ENAMEX> in all its strength and
elasticity, the other more covertly emphasizing a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>'s sensual pleasure in
her physical self and in being touched by others. The corseted shapeliness of
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier decades</TIMEX> had been a treat for the eye and the mind, but not for the
hand. The new, flexible shape, covered by a few thin layers of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fabric</ENAMEX>, was
enjoyable to its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owner</ENAMEX> and accessible to the male grasp. Fur coats came into
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">vogue</ENAMEX>, the dance craze erupted, and the diaphragm was invented, all well before
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World War I.</ENAMEX>

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breasts</ENAMEX>, however, presented a problem. They don't have
muscles that can govern their own movements, and if they're sizable, they swing
and bounce with the slightest motion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>. In the brisk new
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20 th century</TIMEX>, it seemed a good idea for lightly clad but respectable
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> to cover up their breasts and make sure they were held still--without, of
course, reverting to the lines of the old-fashioned corset. Some neat
arrangement was required that would inhibit neither the tennis <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> nor the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Charleston</ENAMEX>.

            The first
bras simply flattened the bosom with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX>, to help create a radically
immature-looking female form. That adroitly solved the public breast problem,
while new cylindrical girdles flattened the hips, tum, and bum. But when ripe
feminine curves came back into fashion in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the '30s</TIMEX>, there appeared the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">double-breasted</ENAMEX> and cantilevered bra--the "uplift" bra. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sweater Girl</ENAMEX>,
exemplified by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lana Turner</ENAMEX>, appeared in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1937</TIMEX>; you could see that under her
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sweater</ENAMEX> was her bra, lifting up, holding out, and separating and steadying her
breasts with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX> insistence. Before long, breasts in visible or invisible
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bras</ENAMEX>--torpedo-shaped, grapefruit-shaped, cone-shaped, headlight-shaped, all
held impossibly high up on the chest--appeared in movies, in ads at every
level, in comic strips, and in soft-core porn. It was the time of "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">I Dreamt I</ENAMEX>
Ran for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">My Maidenform Bra</ENAMEX>."

            
Later the padded bra and the underwire bra
added perfection to individual outlines, and still later, the molded, seamless
bra produced a skinlike surface under tight clothes. From roughly <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1930</TIMEX> to
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">roughly</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1970</TIMEX>, the bra-shaped breast was the only one anybody saw in public
outside an art <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>, and the vision was indelibly imprinted on the collective
mind. A rage for that shape persists; breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">augmentation</ENAMEX> and reduction
procedures are popular, and the bra business is bigger than ever.

            But contemporary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> can
have it both ways. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Women</ENAMEX> who never really need bras can ignore them or wear
them at will. Modern feminism, modern habits, and modern fashion have
familiarized the eye with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mobile</ENAMEX> and visible breasts of different shapes and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sizes</ENAMEX>, even with the harsh truths of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX>. Breasts have lost much of
their mythological aura and acquired some needed reality. But the delicious
look of breasts in bras, to say nothing of the delicious feel of them for the
wearer, taps into a very ancient human joy. Emphasizing breasts is too great a
pleasure to abandon.
