            Imagine a tropical <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> on
which some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX>, at adolescence, magically turn into <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>. Think of the
scientific possibilities! Finally, we could tease apart nature and nurture and
see whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> differed because of how they were brought up as
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>. As the twig is bent, we say, so grows the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX>; we expect these
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teens</ENAMEX> to have girls' minds in boys' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> and to suffer from a painful
confusion of gender roles.

            As it
happens, this is not a thought experiment. In a few <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dominican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX>, some
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> carry a gene that leaves newborn <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> with undescended testicles and a
stunted penis resembling a clitoris. They are raised as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">puberty</TIMEX>,
when the new rush of androgens gives them normal male genitals and a masculine
body, complete with facial hair. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">villagers</ENAMEX> call them guevedoces :
"<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX> [or balls]-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>." The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> switches genders, wears male clothing,
begins to date, and turns into a normal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>, without fuss or trauma. So much
for bending the twig. Gender identity comes either from the effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormones</ENAMEX>
on the brain or from the way <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are treated as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>, or both; childhood
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">nurture</ENAMEX> makes little difference.

            Balls-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> is just one of the fascinating discoveries
brought to light in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Deborah Blum</ENAMEX>'s excellent book <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Sex on the Brain: The</ENAMEX>
Biological <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Differences Between Men and Women</ENAMEX> . This is the real Everything
You Always Wanted to Know About Sex (or The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sexes</ENAMEX>). Why are there sexes? To
change our biochemical locks every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> and keep a step ahead of the
rapidly evolving pathogens that try to pick them. How different are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>'s and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>'s brain structures? Not very. Do raging <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormones</ENAMEX> turn <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> into
testosterone-poisoned <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rapists</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> into weepy premenstrual
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband-stabbers</ENAMEX>? No both times. Are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> biologically different in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ways</ENAMEX> other than the obvious anatomical ones? Yes--<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> are shorter-lived, more
cerebrally lopsided, more violent, better at some spatial abilities, worse at
verbal abilities, more competitive but more forgiving of their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">competitors</ENAMEX>,
more sexually jealous, more socially obtuse, and more promiscuous (at least,
they'd like to be).

            Not only
are we learning more about sex differences, but we also have an elegant theory
to explain them. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1970s</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biologist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Trivers</ENAMEX> showed how all the
major differences between the sexes in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal kingdom</ENAMEX> flow from a
difference in the size of their investment in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">offspring</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">female</ENAMEX> begins with
the bigger ante--an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">egg</ENAMEX> that is far bigger than a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sperm</ENAMEX>--and usually commits
herself to even more, such as yolk; or, in mammals, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk</ENAMEX>. The male
contributes <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a few seconds</TIMEX> of copulation and a teaspoon of semen. The number of
offspring in each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> is limited by the female's contribution: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> for
each <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">egg</ENAMEX> she produces and nurtures.

            
That has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> momentous consequences. First, a
single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">male</ENAMEX> can fertilize several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX>, forcing other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> to go mateless.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Males</ENAMEX> must compete for access to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> by beating each other up, cornering
the resources necessary to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mate</ENAMEX>, or persuading a female to choose them. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>,
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">male</ENAMEX>'s reproductive success depends on how many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> he <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mates</ENAMEX> with, but
not vice versa; for a female, one mating per pregnancy is enough. That makes
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> more discriminating in their choice of sexual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partners</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Humans</ENAMEX>
have added some twists to the mammalian pattern. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Men</ENAMEX> generally invest in their
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> by providing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX>, protection, and care. So <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> also compete for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mates</ENAMEX>, though they look for the ones most willing and able to invest, not the
ones most willing to copulate (those are never in short supply). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Females</ENAMEX>, like
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX>, may be tempted by infidelity, though their genetic motive is quality
rather than quantity. A discreet adulteress can get the genes of the fittest
male and the investment of the most generous male. An easily cuckolded male
would devote his efforts to the genes of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">competitor</ENAMEX>, which is <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Darwinian</ENAMEX>
suicide; hence <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>'s intense sexual jealousy.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blum</ENAMEX> is a superb science <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> who presents just the
right amount of complexity, tries to explain findings rather than just report
them, and writes in a consistently clear and pleasant style. Sex on the
Brain is such a good window on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of the art that its only flaws are
the flaws of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> themselves.

            Unlike
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Wright</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matt Ridley</ENAMEX>, who have also written excellent recent books on
the biology of sex, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blum</ENAMEX> does not ground her own story in rigorous evolutionary
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">biology</ENAMEX>, but rather lets the laboratory <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> speak for themselves.
Unfortunately, many good bench <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> are mediocre <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">theorists</ENAMEX>, often by
choice. "Why" questions are thought to be an indulgence, appropriate only for
musings over <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beer</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at the end of the day</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blum</ENAMEX> reports (and occasionally echoes)
some sloppy evolutionary "explanations," including casual analogies between
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">arbitrary species</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Homo sapiens</ENAMEX>, the equation of evolution with progress,
the idea that contemporary changes in Western <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">society</ENAMEX> are the vanguard of
future evolution, and repeatedly, the error that our adaptations are for the
good of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>.

            
Adaptations are for the good of the genes that
implement them, and one of the best demonstrations is right in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blum</ENAMEX>'s
territory: the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50-50</NUMEX> ratio of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX>. If organisms were designed to
benefit the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, they would not waste half the available <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sons</ENAMEX>, who
can't directly replenish the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">babies</ENAMEX>. Any necessary genetic
variation could easily be supplied by a few studs. Organisms pump out sons
because whenever <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> are more plentiful, the genes of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fathers</ENAMEX>
who bear <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sons</ENAMEX> have a reproductive field day, and the mixture settles at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50-50</NUMEX>.
If the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> suffers, that's just too bad.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blum</ENAMEX> not
only fails to share these explanations, but also sometimes repeats ones that
are downright wrong--such as that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> die young because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> needs them
less. A better explanation is that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX>' reproductive fate depends more
strongly than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX>' on competing when they are young. So any gene that
builds a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> with a strong young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> at the cost of a weak old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> will
prosper.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blum</ENAMEX>'s informants also mislead her in their appeal to
chemistry as an ultimate explanation of sex differences. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blum</ENAMEX> masterfully
explains why the effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormones</ENAMEX> are more complicated than pop science
would have us think. They are produced by several organs in both sexes, may be
converted into one another, and can have varying effects in different <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sexes</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>. The moral is that it is not <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormones</ENAMEX> themselves but the
neural circuitry, shaped by natural selection and modulated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormones</ENAMEX>,
that explains our thoughts and feelings. The role of particular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormones</ENAMEX> may be
like the role of green wires in an electronic device. The answer to the
question "How does the device work?" depends on which wires connect which
chips, not on the fact that a given wire is green.

            This
undermines explanations that assume ironclad effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormones</ENAMEX>. Take the idea
that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> became less competitive because <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> insisted on monogamy, which
lowers testosterone. Natural selection is a resourceful tinkerer and could have
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rewired</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>'s brains to respond to lowered testosterone in any number of ways,
not necessarily by becoming less competitive. A better answer would appeal to
the tradeoffs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> face between investing in their current <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">offspring</ENAMEX> vs.
competing with other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> to sire new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">offspring</ENAMEX> with other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX>.

            
In many circles, "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Biological Differences</ENAMEX>
Between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Men</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Women</ENAMEX>" are fighting words. It seems a short step from saying
that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> are biologically different to saying that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> are
inferior. Moreover, if obnoxious behavior like aggression, rape, and
philandering are biological, that would make them "natural" and hence good--or
at least in the genes, where they cannot be changed by social reform. The
result has been an angry rejection of the research <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blum</ENAMEX> reports and an attempt
to disseminate a feel-good alternative in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> are identical
and infinitely malleable.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blum</ENAMEX> rejects these non
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequiturs</ENAMEX>. She does recount the sexist <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pre-1950s</ENAMEX> research, which is
occasionally hilarious (as when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> were obsessed with testosterone,
which they treated as the essence of masculinity) and sometimes tragic (as when
hare-brained theories led to horrifying surgical procedures on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Blum</ENAMEX>
dismisses bad research with the right touch of scorn, but does not feel a need
to neutralize it with politically palatable agitprop. She believes that science
can approach the truth, and that we are best off if we know it and deal with it
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thoughtfully</ENAMEX>--which she does. Sex differences, she points out, offer no support
to invidious stereotypes, are not a guideline for what is right, do not apply
to every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX>, and never justify the restriction of opportunity. The
ignoble impulses of both sexes are part of a complex mind that can often
override them; and social arrangements, from individual marriages to entire
legal systems, can change for the better.
