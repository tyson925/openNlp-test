            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the funniest moments
in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brendan Gill</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1975</TIMEX> memoir, Here at "The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Yorker</ENAMEX> ," comes
during a luncheon at the now vanished <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ritz</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manhattan</ENAMEX>. At the table are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gill</ENAMEX>;
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Shawn</ENAMEX>, then <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The New Yorker</ENAMEX> ; and the reclusive English
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Green</ENAMEX>. Green's new novel, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Loving</ENAMEX> , has just received a very
favorable review in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The New Yorker</ENAMEX> . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shawn</ENAMEX>--"with his usual hushed
delicacy of speech and manner"--inquires of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">novelist</ENAMEX> whether he could
possibly reveal what prompted the creation of such an exquisite work. Green
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">obliges</ENAMEX>. "I once asked an old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">butler</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ireland</ENAMEX> what had been the happiest
times of his life," he says. "The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">butler</ENAMEX> replied, 'Lying in bed on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX>, eating <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> and toast with cunty fingers.' "

            This was
not the explanation <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shawn</ENAMEX> was expecting, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gill</ENAMEX> tells us. "Discs of bright red
begin to burn in his cheeks."

            Was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shawn</ENAMEX> blushing out of prudishness, as we are meant to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">infer</ENAMEX>? This was, after all, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> renowned for his retiring propriety, a man
who sedulously barred anything smacking of the salacious--from lingerie ads to
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-letter words--from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> he stewarded from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1952 until 1987</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> before his death. But after reading these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> new memoirs about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shawn</ENAMEX>, I
wonder. "He longed for the earthiest and wildest kinds of sexual adventures,"
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lillian Ross</ENAMEX> discloses in hers, adding that he lusted after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hannah Arendt</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Evonne Goolagong</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madonna</ENAMEX>. As for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ved Mehta</ENAMEX>, he reports that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shawn</ENAMEX>'s
favorite thing to watch on television was "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> dancing uninhibitedly"
( <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Soul Train</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> guesses). I suspect <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shawn</ENAMEX> did not blush at the "cunty
fingers" remark out of prudery. He blushed because it had hit too close to
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX>.

            Both these
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">memoirs</ENAMEX> must be read by everyone--everyone, that is, who takes seriously the
important <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX> of sorting out precisely how he or she feels about The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Yorker</ENAMEX> , then and now. Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mehta's</ENAMEX> is far and away the more
entertaining. This may seem odd, for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mehta</ENAMEX> is reputed to be a very dull writer
whereas <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ross</ENAMEX> is a famously zippy one. Moreover, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mehta</ENAMEX> writes as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shawn</ENAMEX>'s adoring
acolyte, whereas <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ross</ENAMEX> writes as his longtime <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adulterous lover</ENAMEX>. Just knowing
that Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shawn</ENAMEX> is still alive adds a certain tension to reading much of what
this Other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Woman</ENAMEX> chooses to divulge. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Evidently</ENAMEX>, "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill"</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lillian</ENAMEX> loved each
other with a fine, pure love, a love that was more than love, a love coveted by
the winged seraphs of heaven. "We had indeed become one," she tells us, freely
venting the inflations of her heart.

            
Shawn was managing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The New</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yorker</ENAMEX> when he hired <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ross</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1945</TIMEX> as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman reporter</ENAMEX>
(the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andy Logan</ENAMEX>). He was short and balding but had pale blue eyes to
die for. As for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ross</ENAMEX>, "I was aware of the fact that I was not unappealing."
During <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a late-night</TIMEX> editorial session, she says, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shawn</ENAMEX> blurted out his love. A
few <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks later</TIMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>, their eyes met. Without a word--even, it seems,
to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cab</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">driver</ENAMEX>--they hied uptown to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Plaza</ENAMEX>, where matters were
consummated. Thereafter, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> set up housekeeping together in an
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">apartment</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> blocks downtown from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Shawn</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX> on upper <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Fifth Avenue</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">stoically</ENAMEX> endured the sufferings of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shawn</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>, who did not want a
divorce.

            Now, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ross</ENAMEX>
seems like a nice <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX>, and I certainly have nothing against adultery, which I
hear is being carried on in the best circles <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these days</TIMEX>. But the public
flaunting of adultery--especially when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spouses</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> are around--well,
it brings out the bourgeois in me. It also made me feel funny about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">William</ENAMEX>
Shawn, whom I have always regarded as a great <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>. I loved his New
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yorker</ENAMEX> . The prose it contained--the gray stuff around the cartoons--was
balm for the soul: unfailingly clear, precise, logical, and quietly stylish. So
what if the articles were occasionally boring? It was a sweet sort of boredom,
serene and restorative, not at all like the kind induced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazines</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>,
which is more akin to nervous exhaustion. Besides, the moral tone of the
magazine was almost wholly admirable--it was ahead of the pack on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hiroshima</ENAMEX>,
civil rights, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vietnam</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Watergate</ENAMEX>, the environment--and this was very much
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shawn</ENAMEX>'s doing. I do not like to think of him in an illicit love <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">nest</ENAMEX>, eating
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> and toast with cunty fingers.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Happily</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ross</ENAMEX> has sprinkled her memoir with clues that it
is not to be taken as entirely factual. To say that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shawn</ENAMEX> was "a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who
grieved over all living <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">creatures</ENAMEX>" is forgivable hyperbole; but later to add
that he "mourned" for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Si Newhouse</ENAMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Newhouse</ENAMEX> unceremoniously fired him in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</TIMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of years</TIMEX> after buying the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX>)--well, that's a bit much.
Even <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus</ENAMEX> had his limits.

            Elsewhere,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ross</ENAMEX> refers to her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lover</ENAMEX>'s "very powerful masculinity," only to note on the
very next page that "if he suffered a paper cut on a finger and saw <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX>, he
would come into my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>, looking pale." She declares that "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill</ENAMEX> was incapable
of engendering a cliché, in deed as well as in word." But then she puts the
most toe-curling clichés into his mouth: "Why am I more ghost than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>?" Or:
"We must arrest our love in midflight. And we fix it forever as of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, a
point of pure light that will reach into eternity." (File that under Romantic
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Effusions We Doubt Ever Got Uttered</ENAMEX>.) Nor is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ross</ENAMEX> incapable of a melodramatic
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cliché</ENAMEX> herself. "Why can't we just live, just live ?" she cries in
anguish when she and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shawn</ENAMEX>, walking hand in hand out of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Central Park</ENAMEX>, chance to
see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shawn</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> slowly making her way down the block with a burden of
packages.

            
And what does she think of Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shawn</ENAMEX>? "I found
her to be sensitive and likeable." Plus, she could "do a mean <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Charleston</ENAMEX>."
There is nothing more poignant than the image of an openly cheated-upon and
humiliated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> doing "a mean <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Charleston</ENAMEX>."

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shawn</ENAMEX>'s indispensability as an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> is amply manifest in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ross</ENAMEX>' memoir. Word
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">repetition?</ENAMEX> "Whatever reporting <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill</ENAMEX> asked me to do turned out to be both
challenging and fun. ... For me, reporting and writing for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> was
fun, pure fun. ... It was never 'work' for me. It was fun." Even in praising
his skill as an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX>, she betrays the presence of its absence. "All <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX>,
of course, have needed the one called the 'editor,' who singularly, almost
mystically, embodies the many-faceted, unique life force infusing the entire
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enchilada</ENAMEX>." Nice touch, that enchilada.

            When cocktail party malcontents mocked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shawn</ENAMEX>'s New
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yorker</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late '70s</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early '80s</TIMEX>, they would make fun of such things
as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">E.J. Kahn</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>-part series on "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Grains of the World</ENAMEX>" or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Elizabeth Drew</ENAMEX>'s
supposedly soporific reporting from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ved Mehta</ENAMEX> was always the
butt of the worst abuse. Shawn was allowing him to publish an autobiography in
the pages of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> that was mounting up to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of words over the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, and the very idea of it seemed to bore <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> silly. After the
publication of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> early installments, "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Daddyji</ENAMEX>" and "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mamaji</ENAMEX>," each the length
of a book, one <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critic</ENAMEX> cried: "Enoughji!"

            But it
kept coming. And I, for one, was grateful. Here was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> growing up in Punjab
during the fall of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Raj</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Partition</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> who had been blinded by
meningitis at the age of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">roller</ENAMEX>-skating through the back <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lahore</ENAMEX>
as <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Sikhs</ENAMEX> slaughtered <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hindus</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Hindus</ENAMEX> slaughtered <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslims</ENAMEX> and civilization was
collapsing and then, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades later</TIMEX>, having made his way from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> to an
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arkansas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> for the blind to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Balliol College</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxford</ENAMEX>, to <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The New</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yorker</ENAMEX> , re-creating the whole thing in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Proustian</ENAMEX> detail and
better-than-Proustian prose ... !

            
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mehta</ENAMEX>'s multivolume autobiography, titled
Continents of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Exile</ENAMEX> , has loss as its overarching theme: loss of sight,
of childhood, of home and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, and now--with this volume--loss of Mr.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shawn</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Yorker</ENAMEX> . The memoir takes us from the time the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> was
hired as a staff <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early '60s up to 1994</TIMEX>, when he was "terminated"
by the loathed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tina Brown</ENAMEX> in her vandalization of his cherished <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mehta</ENAMEX>
evidently loved <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Shawn</ENAMEX> at least as much as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lillian Ross</ENAMEX> did, although
his love was not requited in the same way. He likens the revered <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character Prince</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Myshkin</ENAMEX> in The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Idiot</ENAMEX> : innocent and vulnerable, someone
who must be protected. And long-suffering, one might infer: "He was so careful
of not hurting anyone's feelings that he often listened to utterly fatuous
arguments for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> on end."

            Like
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ross</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mehta</ENAMEX> struggles to express <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Shawn</ENAMEX>'s ineffable virtues. "It is as
if, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mehta</ENAMEX>, he were beyond our human conception," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Janet Flanner</ENAMEX> tells him once
to calm him down. At times I wondered whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>, in his ecstasies of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">devotion</ENAMEX>, had not inadvertently committed plagiarism. His words on Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shawn</ENAMEX>
sound suspiciously like those of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pooter</ENAMEX> on his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boss</ENAMEX> Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Perkupp</ENAMEX> in The
Diary of a Nobody . Compare. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mehta</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shawn</ENAMEX>: "His words were so generous
that I could scarcely find my tongue, even to thank him." Pooter on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Perkupp</ENAMEX>:
"My heart was too full to thank him." <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mehta</ENAMEX>: "I started saying to myself
compulsively, 'I wish Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shawn</ENAMEX> would ring,' at the oddest times of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> or
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>. ... How I longed for the parade of proofs, the excitement of rewriting
and perfecting!" Pooter: "Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Perkupp</ENAMEX>, I will work <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> and day to serve
you!"

            I am not sure I have made it sound this way so far, but
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mehta</ENAMEX>'s book is completely engrossing--the most enjoyable book, I think, I have
ever reviewed. It oozes affection and conviction, crackles with anger, and is
stuffed with thumping good stories. Many are about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mehta</ENAMEX>'s daft <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> at
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Yorker</ENAMEX> , such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> in the next <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>:

            His door was
always shut, but I could hear him through the wall that separated his cubicle
from mine typing without pause. ... Even the changing of the paper in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">typewriter</ENAMEX> seemed somehow to be incorporated into the rhythmic
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX>-tat-tat <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">... year after year</TIMEX> went by to the sound of his typing but
without a word from his typewriter appearing in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX>.

            Or the great and eccentric
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Irish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maeve Breenan</ENAMEX>, who fetched up as a bag <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX>. Or the legendary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clair McKelway</ENAMEX>, whose decisive breakdown came when he hailed a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cab</ENAMEX> and
prevailed upon the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">driver</ENAMEX> to take him to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Yorker</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">West 43</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rd St.</ENAMEX> "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O.K.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mac</ENAMEX>, if that's what you want." He was in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX>
at the time. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McKelway</ENAMEX> later told <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mehta</ENAMEX> that if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cabby</ENAMEX> had not called him
"<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mac</ENAMEX>," his nickname, an alarm might have gone off in his head.)

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mehta</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">writerly</ENAMEX> persona, a disarming mixture of the feline and the naive, is perfect
for relating the little scandals that worried <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The New Yorker</ENAMEX> in the late
'70s (plagiarism, frozen <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">turbot</ENAMEX>), the drama of finding a worthy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> to
succeed the aging <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shawn</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX>, the purchase of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> by the evil <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Si</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Newhouse</ENAMEX> ("We all took fright") and the resultant plague of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gottliebs</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Florios</ENAMEX> visited upon it, and what he sees as the final debacle: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tinaji</ENAMEX>.

            
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lillian Ross</ENAMEX>, by contrast, takes a rather
cheerful view of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX> dispensation. Indeed, the new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> even coaxed
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ross</ENAMEX> into re-joining the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX>, just as she was booting <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mehta</ENAMEX> out. "I found
that she possessed--under the usual disguises--her own share of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill</ENAMEX>'s kind of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">naivete</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">insight</ENAMEX>, and sensitivity," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ross</ENAMEX> says of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX>. "She, too, 'got it.' "
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A few months</TIMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX> was appointed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shawn</ENAMEX> died at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the age of 85</TIMEX>. He
had long since stopped reading his beloved <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX>, in sorrow and relief.
That's if you believe <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mehta</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ross</ENAMEX> assures us that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shawn</ENAMEX> was reading <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tina</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Yorker</ENAMEX> "with new interest" in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the weeks</TIMEX> prior to his
death.

            Has <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tina Brown</ENAMEX> betrayed the
legacy of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Shawn</ENAMEX>, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mehta</ENAMEX> fiercely believes, or has she continued and
built upon it, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ross</ENAMEX> is evidently convinced? Have the changes she has wrought
enlivened a stodgy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> or vulgarized a dignified one--or both? These are
weighty questions, and one is of course loath to compromise one's life chances
by hazarding unripe opinions in a public <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">forum</ENAMEX> such as this.
