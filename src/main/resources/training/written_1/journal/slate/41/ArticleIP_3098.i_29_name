            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> used to go to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">beach</ENAMEX> to see other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in an unusual state of near nakedness, especially
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">girls</ENAMEX>, and stare at them in perfect freedom. It was impossible to do this
anywhere else. Magazines showed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> in sleek, revealing swimsuits (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX>,
too), but that wasn't the same as real ones moving around, some of them people
you actually knew. It used to be the national pastime, after <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">baseball</ENAMEX>, a summer
thrill for everybody. And then, after admiring all the pretty girls on local
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">beaches</ENAMEX>, you topped it off by watching the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miss America</ENAMEX> pageant and staring at
the prettiest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> in the whole <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, parading around in their bathing
suits on TV instead of the beach. It was like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dessert</ENAMEX>.

            Recently,
the pageant has got itself into trouble by implicitly acknowledging this truth
about itself. It decided to allow <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-piece bathing suits into the competition.
At the same time, however, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miss America</ENAMEX> pageant stiffened up its
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">terminology</ENAMEX> so as to avoid calling the event a beauty contest, or the girls
gorgeous. The word is out to call the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> talented and confident, and the
event a scholarship program. It is, I suspect, this bit of doublespeak that has
really set off the alarm, alerting both the hypocrisy-sniffers and the
exploitation-of-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>'s-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies people</ENAMEX> at the same time.

            Excluding beauty is a ridiculous development for the Miss
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">America</ENAMEX> contest. Everybody knows that the pageant is about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sweetheart</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> whose earnest desire to do good in the world and do well
in her work is most purely embodied in her lovely face and perfect <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">figure</ENAMEX>. It's
part of the wholesome old tradition equating <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goodness</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Truth</ENAMEX> with Beauty,
particularly the beauty of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. It's opposed to the wicked old tradition
equating the beauty of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Perdition</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX>-piece bathing suits
are so much a part of wholesome <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> life that the world's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wives</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughters</ENAMEX> have been wearing them for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX>, and navels of all ages are a
customary sight.

            So
customary have they become, in fact, that the pageant's decision comes at the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> when bathing suits are no longer even considered particularly explosive.
The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June</TIMEX> issue of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vogue</ENAMEX> , for example, showed several shots of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">girls</ENAMEX>--among them <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Uma Thurman</ENAMEX>--on a sandy beach, writhing in the surf wearing
long clinging <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</TIMEX> dresses instead of bathing suits. A current issue of
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Elle</ENAMEX> shows a sunny beach with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> shots of wet <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> in long
printed wrap skirts and long-sleeved flowing shirts over their bathing suits.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> is wearing nothing but a bathing suit, and it seemed to be made
of a very shaggy bathroom rug cut in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>.

            
Something has clearly happened to bathing
suits. Of course, something started happening to bathing suits as soon as they
were invented--that is, they got progressively more revealing. (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Swimsuits</ENAMEX> were
invented in the revolutionary <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1840s</NUMEX> to permit mixed bathing on public beaches.
Before that, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> bathed separately in the nude.) In due course we
wound up with the modern swimsuit and the respectable nearly naked nude,
ratified for all time by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miss America</ENAMEX> pageant and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sports</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Illustrated</ENAMEX> . In the beginning, though, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>'s bathing suit was designed
to repel the avid male gaze. With their knee-length bloomers, long stockings,
and big, thick belted tunic with elbow-length sleeves, these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outfits</ENAMEX> were all
business and no pleasure. The advanced <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1890s</NUMEX> permitted bathing suits to catch
the eye, but only with nautical touches and a less engulfing shape, under which
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">corseting</ENAMEX> might be applied to sharpen the outline. No skin could appear.

            The real
change in bathing suits began during <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">I.</ENAMEX> Even before that, a radical
exposure in female clothing was underway; skirts rose up and permanently
unveiled the shoes, necklines showing the collarbone began to be worn before
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sundown</ENAMEX>. Wartime excitement fostered the sense that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brave Boys</ENAMEX> deserved a
thrill before they marched away, and the truly patriotic bathing suit had to
deliver some instant courage to the allied <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX>.

            The style of that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">era</TIMEX> was set by the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Mack Sennett Bathing</ENAMEX>
Beauties of the silver screen: naked <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX>, shoulders, backs, and armpits topped
off skimpy costumes baring knees and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">an inch</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of thigh. The tight corset
had vanished and dieting had yet to be invented, so the jiggly female form
showed amply through the bathing suit. And soon such daring beach wear could,
should, and indeed had to be worn, not just by actresses with doubtful morals
and a professional stake in their physical looks, but by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> next door. It
was all a matter of keeping the home fires burning and preserving the values
that mattered.

            Ever
since, it has been a part of every good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX>'s duty, heaven help her, to adorn
public beaches and neighborhood swimming <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pools</ENAMEX> with eye-striking,
heart-stopping, skin-baring bathing suits that provided less and less shelter
with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every decade</TIMEX>. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX>'s respectability was forever sundered from the
concealment of her bodily facts--quite the reverse, it became attached to their
display. Consequently, keeping the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> fit for the task has been built into
female basic training for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX>, despite new shifts in the direction
of female ambition and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">foundation</ENAMEX> of new codes of female honor. And that
training still keeps the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miss America</ENAMEX> pageant in business, despite the
occasional minor agitation that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vainly</ENAMEX> urges it to stop the swimsuit
competition.

            
Lately, however, a shift in fashion has
attacked this ancient female habit of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> and mind. For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> thing, as the Miss
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">America</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have probably noticed, vast tracts of once-hidden bare skin can
now be everywhere exposed: in the public <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX>, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">buses</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">subways</ENAMEX>, in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grand Central Terminal</ENAMEX>. Who needs the beach for the ritual summer thrill?
Further degrees of exposure became impossible after the string and the thong
came in, went out, and returned. And so what's happened to bathing suits is
that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX> have lost interest in them, except, perhaps, for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">organizers</ENAMEX> of
Miss <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>.

            Even the
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-part fluffy carpet I saw in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Elle</ENAMEX> seems just an awkward effort to
stir things up. A recent <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Paris Match</ENAMEX> tried to help by offering <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Most</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Expensive Bathing Suits</ENAMEX> available <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX>, all photographed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helmut Newton</ENAMEX>
and worn by the unbelievable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eva Herzigova</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Galliano</ENAMEX> won at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$25,000</NUMEX> with a
black <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cotton</ENAMEX>-satin hourglass corset covered with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">jeweled sprays</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stars</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">faintly</ENAMEX> suggesting <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jane Russell</ENAMEX>; followed at a great distance by a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2,000</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yoshibi Ishinuma</ENAMEX> bikini made entirely of swooping black coq feathers;
and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Beaulieu</ENAMEX> bikini made entirely of pale mink, available at a modest
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$750</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thierry Mugler</ENAMEX>'s black satin <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-piece took the sado-maso route with
stark black bands clutching ribcage and upper thigh, also for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$750</NUMEX>. Relief from
this was offered by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dolce & Gabbana</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-piece in white lace and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lycra</ENAMEX>,
indistinguishable from the underwear of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1949</TIMEX> and selling for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">only $125</NUMEX>. But
such giddy stuff isn't really beach wear, great though <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helmut</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Eva</ENAMEX>, and
Galliano all are to contemplate at length.

            Extra daring nakedness has gone back to being the domain of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> who pose for nude photos or who wear runway couture
that bares the breasts, buttocks, and navel under transparent spangled veiling
meant for ballrooms, not the beach. Meanwhile the neat bikinis and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-piece
suits also shown in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">June Vogue</ENAMEX> look like timeless fashion classics,
photographed on a perfect <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> in a manner suggesting the serene elegance of
antique sculpture. We could easily follow along in that vein, in our less
perfect versions, and so can <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miss America</ENAMEX>, in her sweet <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>; but what's truly
groundbreaking nowadays is to stroll on the sand or romp in the waves in a
full-length dress.
