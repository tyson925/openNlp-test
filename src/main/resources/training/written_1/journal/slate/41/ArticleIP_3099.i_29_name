            The current
show at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metropolitan Museum</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Costume Institute</ENAMEX> concentrates on
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20 th -century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garments</ENAMEX> bearing words, letters, and numbers in various
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ways</ENAMEX>. There are a few word-bearing accessories from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier days</TIMEX>--garters,
stockings, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fans</ENAMEX>, and gloves, most with political or erotic reference--but the
clothes date mostly from the middle to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of this century</TIMEX>. Nevertheless
the show's punning title, "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wordrobe</ENAMEX>," appears on the wall with the displaced
"a" in flashing red neon above the first "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">o.</ENAMEX>" Right away we're meant to think
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hester Prynne</ENAMEX>'s big <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">scarlet</ENAMEX> A, imposed by the godly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX>, which she
defiantly embellished with gold thread. In so doing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hester</ENAMEX> was transgressing a
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> time, because in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17 th century</TIMEX>, in which the novel was set
(and in the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">19 th</NUMEX> , in which it was written), wearing letters for
decoration on everyday clothing was entirely unacceptable.

            It is still disturbing,
or was until very recently. Why is that? Words, letters, and numbers on
garments seem riskier than kittens, clouds, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> on garments, just as
those seem less natural than stripes, plaids, or checks. But what, exactly, is
profaned by putting words on clothes? Is it the garment, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>, or the
words? I believe it is the writing. The written word was accumulating its own
sacred aura even before <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Homer</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bible</ENAMEX>. Ever since <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priests</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">poets</ENAMEX> used writing to record <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scripture</ENAMEX>, prayer law, and history both exalted
and prosaic, reverence for canonical writings has lent an august power to
written words themselves. And with all the weight of such a past, a certain
dread can still attach to the sight of them being frivolously used.

            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the middle of this century</TIMEX>, turning words into fashion
seemed like just such a use. Some of the designs shown at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Met</ENAMEX> reflect a
serious daring; they are examples not just of amusing invention but also of
rule-breaking. Turning the cutout letters of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Emily Post</ENAMEX>'s Advice to
Debutantes into a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">debutante</ENAMEX>'s dress (designed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Evans</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wong</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>), or
knitting the preamble to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Constitution</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Declaration of Independence</ENAMEX>
into a cashmere sweater (designed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joseph Golden</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>), or even just making
a dress out of random alphabet-lace (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late 1920s</TIMEX>)--all these are ways of
flaunting modern fashion's basic iconoclasm.

            After the show, I looked
around the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> to see if I could find any paintings representing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with
writing on their clothes. I found only <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christ</ENAMEX> and the Virgin and the occasional
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">saint</ENAMEX>, clad in ceremonial garments edged with golden or pearl-sewn words from
liturgy or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scripture</ENAMEX>--but these were worn only in heaven. Earthly mortals
didn't seem to have the privilege. Words or letters or numbers on your clothes
set you apart as some sort of human object, sacred like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Anthony</ENAMEX> or shameful
like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hester Prynne</ENAMEX> or maybe useful like a team <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX>.

            There is, in fact, an
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">old</ENAMEX> football jersey in this show, with a big number on it. But it's mainly
there as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foil</ENAMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an evening</TIMEX> dress by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Geoffrey Beene</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1968</TIMEX>) with a football
number in glittering beading. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beene</ENAMEX> has another beautiful, sleek black one with
a sequined traffic sign emblazoned across the chest, a big, shiny yellow
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">triangle</ENAMEX> with "yield" in black <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capitals</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1967</TIMEX>). Wonderful to look at--with the
meaning not lost, just transmuted, by the sequins.

            More stirring is a sheer bodysuit designed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jean Paul</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gaultier</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX> that transforms the wearer into a living <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">banknote</ENAMEX>, all
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gray</ENAMEX>-green engraved swirls and crosshatching, with an occasional "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">100</ENAMEX>" at
salient <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">corners</ENAMEX>. This stretches the theme a little, since there are no words
and it isn't the reproduction of a real bill. But it works, like so much else
in the exhibition, to show how practical signs can become erotic adornments on
the human surface, depending on texture and placement. This skintight,
transparent garment turns its pattern into a tattoo, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">practice</ENAMEX> alluded to by
several other items here, including some skin-colored Gaultier swim trunks that
seem to cover the genitals with a tattoo saying "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Safe Sex Forever</ENAMEX>" (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>).

            Monograms have a natural
place in the "wordrobe," but they were not invented for clothing. The rich and
the noble used to put them on personal effects to imitate the ancient royal
habit of stamping (or embroidering or incising) the king's property with his
personal cipher. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Artisans</ENAMEX> would discreetly stamp precious creations with their
own monograms in minidesigner-label mode, while giving elaborate prominence to
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">client</ENAMEX>'s. There are plenty of surviving cigar cases, purses, boxes,
lockets, brooches, penknives, and all kinds of tableware with small
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">maker-monograms</ENAMEX> and large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">owner</ENAMEX>-monograms; and there are mountains of antique
household linen with embroidered domestic monograms.

            But none of these is
clothing. Putting monograms on display on garments is very recent. I know my
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> thought monogrammed blouses and bathrobes vulgar--but not monogrammed
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bracelets</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guest</ENAMEX> towels; from which I gather that vivid personal monograms on
clothes were new in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the '30s</TIMEX>. Once everybody got used to them in the next
generation, it was very easy to replace them with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YSL</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CK</ENAMEX> and the double Gs
in the following <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>. And those have acquired a lot more prestige than our own
ever had.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sultan SÃ¡ladin</ENAMEX>, the great <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12 th -century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponent</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Crusaders</ENAMEX>, had an ornate monogram that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary McFadden</ENAMEX> borrowed
to adorn a dignified <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX> ensemble that is on view in this show. Of course it
can't be read by those familiar with only <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> letters; nor can all
the beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> characters in this exhibition, similarly
reduced to abstract motifs by our inability to recognize what they say. (It
does seem unfair to love them only for their looks, as if we despised their
minds.) Unlike Judaism and Christianity, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Islam</ENAMEX> has used script for sumptuous
decoration of all kinds. But the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Islamic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX>, like those in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>, didn't forget that the immortal soul of the word is its sense; nor that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clothing</ENAMEX>, since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">prehistory</TIMEX>, has made sense without words. <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Arabic</ENAMEX> words appear
on beautiful textiles, but not on those worn as clothing. Similarly, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japanese</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">calligraphy</ENAMEX> has a great artistic tradition, no less great than that of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japanese</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">watercolor</ENAMEX> painting or <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> costume, and beautifully brushed poems may
appear next to watercolor images similar to those that often appear on clothes.
But the words do not go on the garments.

            It has taken modern Western
fashion to make that happen. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brocade</ENAMEX> or chiffon dresses covered in
who-knows-what utterances in beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Arabic</ENAMEX> script, or dresses
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">wittily</ENAMEX> made of paper printed with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Yellow Pages</ENAMEX>, all express a
joyful relish in the decay of the written word, a forthright pleasure in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> its meaning has been draining away. Indeed, you could view this show as a
carnivalesque celebration of our growing tolerance for illiteracy.

            At the end of the show is a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cluster</ENAMEX> of popular sportswear with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tommy Hilfiger</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donna Karan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nautica</ENAMEX>, the
Gap, and such names applied to it. These prove that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hester Prynne</ENAMEX>'s proud
display of her A was prophetic. For with the proliferation of shifting public
signage, slogans, logos, and the lava flow of printout, the words on your
clothes are now what certify your physical existence. They put you in harmony
with the rest of the material world, as well as with the electronically written
universe on the Internet. Words are now rarely carved in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stone</ENAMEX>; printed books
are quickly pulped; but endless messages flicker momentarily on screens or on
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this month</TIMEX>'s T-shirt. The exhibition tells us that as a vessel of lasting sense
or sacred truth, the written word may be losing ground, but that as a source of
inarticulate comfort, it has gained much.
