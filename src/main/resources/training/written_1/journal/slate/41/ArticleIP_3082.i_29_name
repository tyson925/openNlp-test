            What accounts for charisma
in music--for the authority or power that strangely radiates from this or that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">performer</ENAMEX>, not just from the sound but (so it seems) from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">performer</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">personality</ENAMEX>, from the shake of a head or the expressive curl of a wrist? I
realize that, of all the grand effects that music can produce, charisma is one
of the cheapest--which is to say, the easiest to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fake</ENAMEX>, if your standards are
not too high. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Years ago</TIMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the days</TIMEX> before I became a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalist</ENAMEX>, I played
trombone with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> called the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Uptown Horns</ENAMEX>, backing up blues and rock bands,
and I savor the memory of how our jaded little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> used to mock the rock
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">world</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cult</ENAMEX> of the charismatic. To hold one's fist stiffly in the air in a
gesture of ridiculous defiance while the bass amplifier thundered and the
guitar shrieked and our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tenor</ENAMEX> sax honked deliriously, and to see a
barroom <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> respond with shouts and their own idiotic fists in the beery
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">air</ENAMEX>--that was to laugh. A fascist rally at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Second Avenue</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mill</ENAMEX>. We
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">musicians</ENAMEX> were all smirks, behind our kick-ass fa√ßade.

            In the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last few months</TIMEX> I've been running around to classical concerts in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>
looking for charismatic qualities in places where, in theory, they might be
expected, and I've noticed something else about the charismatic in music. A
genuine touch of the charismatic is never where you expect it to be. A given
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">soloist</ENAMEX> might be wonderfully talented, and might choose to perform the kind of
music that exudes noble and heroic inspirations with every phrase--and, even
so, the indefinable strength that counts as charismatic might fail to appear.
An example--not to be cruel, but just to show what I'm getting at--could be
seen at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York Philharmonic</ENAMEX> debut, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of months ago</TIMEX>, of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">violinist</ENAMEX>
named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Peter Zimmermann</ENAMEX>, from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zimmermann</ENAMEX>'s reputation in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> is said to be excellent.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>, where he played the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bruch Violin Concerto in G minor</ENAMEX> , the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> leapt to its feet and gushed appreciation. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX>
pronounced itself content. Yet what can I say? It may have been the doughy look
of earnest concentration on the young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>'s ample cheeks, or it may have been
his habit, at the conclusion of every dazzling, double-stopped arpeggio, of
deftly lifting his bow off the strings with a satisfied air--a happy pastry
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">chef</ENAMEX>, pleased and relieved to have given the world <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> more perfect Linzer
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">torte</ENAMEX>. And the result was, to be honest, dismal--even if the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">concerto</ENAMEX>'s many
splendidly demagogic passages, performed virtuosically, did their customary
work.

            The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clearest</ENAMEX> examples of charismatic musicianship that I've seen lately have been
in performances by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yuri Bashmet</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">violist</ENAMEX>, who was in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> not
long ago, conducting his own <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chamber orchestra</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carnegie Hall</ENAMEX> and playing
with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philharmonic</ENAMEX> under <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kurt Masur</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bashmet</ENAMEX> ought to be an unlikely source
of spectacular and forceful effects, due to the humble nature of his
instrument. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">viola</ENAMEX> tends to be plaintively melancholic, or else to squawk,
ugly-duckling style, like a bassoon or an <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> horn. In the pantheon of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">instruments</ENAMEX>, the viola is a mortal, not a god. Yet when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bashmet</ENAMEX> comes out onto
the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stage</ENAMEX>, wiping his <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prince Valiant</ENAMEX> locks off his face and holding his non-god
by its helpless neck, like a dead rabbit, you feel, even before he starts to
play, a vibration in the air, ever so slightly, as if gusting from the air
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">conditioner</ENAMEX>.

            
Before he starts? I admit there is something
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fishy</ENAMEX> in that observation. I blame his pre-concert publicity. Bashmet, we are
told (by virtually every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalist</ENAMEX> who has written about him), began his
musical career on the electric <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">guitar</ENAMEX>--a teen-age rock <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">star</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rostov</ENAMEX>-on-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Don</ENAMEX>
back in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 1960s</TIMEX>. He played in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Beatles</ENAMEX>-style <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX>, then embraced the
viola out of the despairing recognition that, on the guitar, he would never
match the fireworks of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jimi Hendrix</ENAMEX>, his idol. And so the violist gazes outward
from the stage, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX>, mulling over the biographical background with
its air of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">'60s</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mayhem</ENAMEX> and long-lost <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dissident hipness</ENAMEX>, is bound to
wonder: Is this a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Promethean</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">figure</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hendrix</ENAMEX>-like, standing before us? A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> of
extremes? On the verge of mental <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">derangement</ENAMEX>?

            He plays
with a weird <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">supercontrol</ENAMEX>. He produces a wide, sumptuous when he wants to, and
at other times the speedy wobble of a swallowed scream. But characteristically,
he uses very little vibrato at all, and the tones that emerge are round and
affectless, like a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> singing falsetto. His emotional peaks are almost always
achieved at the lowest volume. He whispers. You expect him to sink beneath the
level of audibility. But those falsetto timbres of his make a searing tone,
even in a middle register, where tones are usually not searing, and the sound
is an X-ray, which penetrates everywhere.

            The of his performances that I have heard do not capture
the full strangeness in this sound. The CDs get louder or softer, but the
quality of penetration fails to vary. The true X-ray tonality is something you
can hear only in the concert <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX>. And in the concert <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX> you become aware,
also, how risky it is for him to produce that very strange sound--which is to
say, how heroic is his playing. In a recital at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carnegie Hall</ENAMEX> more than a year
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ago</TIMEX>, he reached for that sound and, at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> excruciating moment, lost control of
his bowing and sent out a wild overtone, double the volume of his normal
playing, like the feedback on an electric <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">guitar</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hendrix</ENAMEX>-like, after all--the
worst howler I've ever heard from a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">musician</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> rank.

            At his
Philharmonic appearance during his most recent visit, he performed a viola
concerto by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">composer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alfred Schnittke</ENAMEX>, who not only wrote the piece
for him but was kind enough to derive a theme <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cabalistically</ENAMEX> from the letters
in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bashmet</ENAMEX>'s name. The concerto--you can hear it for yourself on --is a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fantastic</ENAMEX> affair. It feels like an ancient epic, with the viola as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gilgamesh</ENAMEX>,
wandering the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">earth</ENAMEX>. Unspeakable horrors deploy across the background. Tartar
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hordes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Stalinist</ENAMEX> work <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">brigades</ENAMEX> seem to go marching past, in flaming colors.
The violence is shocking. The starry sky is gorgeous.

            
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schnittke</ENAMEX> is a witty <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">composer</ENAMEX>, and at certain
moments you have the feeling that he is drunkenly singing sardonic songs of woe
and contempt. And, all the while, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yuri Bashmet</ENAMEX> goes threading his way across
the foreground, a lonely <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> with an eerie and haunting sound, sometimes
quietly shrieking, sometimes singing lyrically--a heartbreaking figure,
heartbreakingly courageous--until, by the end, he seems to be quietly sobbing.
I'm not sure that, in the course of his performance with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philharmonic</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bashmet</ENAMEX> didn't once again lose control of . Yet by the end I was nearly sobbing
myself.

            It was because the
charismatic in music is genuinely awe-inspiring, and to watch the violist trek
across <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Schnittke</ENAMEX>'s barbarous <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> landscape was like watching humanity and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inhumanity</ENAMEX> in ferocious battle, waging every grand and noble struggle that we
associate with the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19 th -century</TIMEX> violin concertos, except without any
of the reassuring triumphalism that, among <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19 th -century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">composers</ENAMEX>,
was indistinguishable from a finale.

            But what is this
awesome thing--the charismatic in music? My supposition of the moment--now that
I find myself under <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bashmet</ENAMEX>'s sway (a definite indication of charismatic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX>,
by the way)--is that charisma in music, the real thing and not the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fake</ENAMEX>, is a
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more</NUMEX>-than-musical quality. Music is always telling stories (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">more or less</NUMEX>), and
I think that charismatic power is an element in one of those stories--the force
we feel when a strong personality comes up against a demonic power and refuses
to be cowed, and takes hair-raising risks, and succeeds in being, if only for a
moment, the demon's equal.
