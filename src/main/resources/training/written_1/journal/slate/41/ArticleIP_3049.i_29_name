            What the agony of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus</ENAMEX> on
the cross is to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christians</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Holocaust</ENAMEX> is to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX>. Except that the massacre
of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> whose only crime was to be born <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> has no transcendent meaning,
no sacred closure. To theologize the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Holocaust</ENAMEX> is meaningless even to the
super-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Orthodox</ENAMEX> who accept everything as God's will. To secular skeptical <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX>,
the horror is still just another episode, though the worst, in the unending
suspicion and hatred of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX>.

            What some
piously accept and others try to explain is to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aharon Appelfeld</ENAMEX> "a central
event in many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>'s lives that has become a metaphor for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">our century</TIMEX>. There
cannot be an end to speaking and writing about it." Appelfeld, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">survivor</ENAMEX> from
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Czernowitz</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Austrian Galicia</ENAMEX> whose <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">language</ENAMEX> was <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX>, now lives in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jerusalem</ENAMEX> and writes in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Hebrew</ENAMEX>. He is the most telling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">novelist</ENAMEX> of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Holocaust</ENAMEX>, for he has no need to describe it directly. He has put his own
suffering--as a boy he saw a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Nazi</ENAMEX> kill his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>--into short narratives of
self-absorbed <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> life before the war that are so ominously toneless,
artfully simple and repetitious, deceptively compressed in feeling, that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reader</ENAMEX>, aware of the horror about to descend on these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, feels like
screaming but knows he will not be heard.

            The best-known of these narratives are Badenheim
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1939</TIMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1980</TIMEX>) and To the Land of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cattails</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</TIMEX>). In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Iron</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tracks Appelfeld</ENAMEX> has reversed his usual strategy. The <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">war</ENAMEX> ended <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">long ago</TIMEX>,
but for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Erwin Siegelbaum</ENAMEX>, who at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> saw the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Nazi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nachtigel</ENAMEX> murder his
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>, the war has never ended. For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40 years</TIMEX> he has been living on trains
that remind him of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX> on which he was once deported. His purpose is to
find <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Nachtigel</ENAMEX> and kill him. This is mad, but it signifies the depth at which
the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Holocaust</ENAMEX> can enter a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jew</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soul</ENAMEX>.

            Since
the end of the war, I have been on this line, as they say: a long, twisted line
stretching from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Naples</ENAMEX> to the cold north, a line of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locals</ENAMEX>, trams, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">taxis</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">carriages</ENAMEX>. The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seasons</TIMEX> shift before my eyes like an illusion. I have learned
this route with my body. Now I know every hostel and every inn, every
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">restaurant</ENAMEX> and buffet, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicles</ENAMEX> that bring you to the remotest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">corners</ENAMEX>.

            
Boarding still another <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX>, he gets "a sort
of constant renewal." One can live on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trains</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> now know him so
well that they drop the loud, jangling popular music he detests on the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">loudspeaker</ENAMEX> and put on chamber music. Shaving on a train gives him a new start
in life. There is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX> where he is met by a regular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">driver</ENAMEX>, now a sort
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX>. There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stations</ENAMEX> on his route for which he has "love,"
stations he can return to knowing he will be able to refresh himself with a
solid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meal</ENAMEX> and a cup of really good <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX>. But for the most part "I live by
signs, by codes whose meaning I alone know." There was even a terrible moment
when he spent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks</TIMEX> in bed "because it seemed to me that a new war had
started."

            "I
confess, I have no faith in anyone outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX>." He is so frozen inside
that he remains completely detached from the occasional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> who
attracts him:

            There
is nothing like love on a train. Sometimes it lasts only a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>. The
main thing is that you'll never see the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> again. Of course, sometimes you
get entangled, and you suddenly have, aside from your valise, a sluggish
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">creature</ENAMEX> who keeps demanding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX> and cigarettes. Thus I repeat to myself:
love for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stations</ENAMEX>, and no more.

            In his apathy he remembers the farce lived by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jewish</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">orators</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">organizers</ENAMEX> such as his <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Communist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>. They were always moving
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about</TIMEX>, depriving him of a proper home--and always resolute. They could not take
in the fact that their comrades disliked them for being <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX>.

            My memory is my downfall.
It is a sealed well that doesn't lose a drop, to use an old expression. Nothing
can deplete it. My memory is a powerful machine that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> and constantly
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">discharges</ENAMEX> lost <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> and faces. In the past I believed that travel would blunt
my memory; I was wrong. Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</TIMEX>, I must admit, it has only grown
stronger. Were it not for my memory, my life would be different--better, I
assume. My memory fills me up until I choke on a stream of daydreams. ... But
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX> I have learned to overcome this. A glass of cognac, for
instance, separates me from my memory for a while.

            Where does
he find the funds for this endless life on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trains</ENAMEX>? This is one of the subtlest
issues in the book. He lives by buying up old ceremonial objects retrieved from
synagogues nearly destroyed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Nazis</ENAMEX>. And in this merchandising of the
once-sacred there is no relief for him, no peace. He has <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">competitors</ENAMEX> also
searching for these objects, and what is more, they too are looking for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nachtigel</ENAMEX> in order to avenge themselves.

            
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peasants</ENAMEX> and army <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">veterans</ENAMEX> Siegelbaum
encounters think favorably of the war. An <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">innkeeper</ENAMEX> who lost his hearing at
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stalingrad</ENAMEX> and communicates by writing answers <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Siegelbaum</ENAMEX>'s saying, "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hitler</ENAMEX>
deceived the world":

            "Not true,"
he replied without hesitation.

            "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Why?</ENAMEX>"

            "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hitler</ENAMEX>
wanted to destroy the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX>, and indeed he destroyed them," he explained.

            When I
didn't answer, he added in big letters: "It was a great mission, and it
succeeded."

            "But they
still exist," I couldn't refrain from writing to him.

            "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A</ENAMEX>
mistake," he didn't hesitate to reply.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Siegelbaum</ENAMEX> wants to kill the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> for revealing his hidden desire. "I ought to have killed him. There is
nothing simpler than killing a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>, and yet for some reason, I cannot do it."
Eventually he does locate <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nachtigel</ENAMEX> and, after some false pleasantries, he
shoots him. The event leaves him pretty much as he was before. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> need
to find an answer to the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Holocaust</ENAMEX> is not forthcoming. It would have to be as
monumental and world-shattering as the terror itself. In the face of prosperous
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">postwar Germany</ENAMEX>, retribution is a joke. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Siegelbaum</ENAMEX> finally cries out, "Why
can't I pray<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">?</ENAMEX>" he cannot find an answer within himself. His "melancholy" is a
well-known <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> disease. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Communist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> he knew even spoke grandly of
a "war against melancholy."

            Its real name is despair,
that central human emotion in the face of overwhelming odds of which tragedy is
made. There are no accommodating solutions after the fact. There is no
forgiveness for so much pain, and no one to reconcile with. But a story as
piercing as this goes to the heart of the matter, for it embodies the terrible
event in such a way that it steals up on us and will haunt us in our sleep.
