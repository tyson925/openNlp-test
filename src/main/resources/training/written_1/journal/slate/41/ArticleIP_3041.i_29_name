            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Keats</ENAMEX>' life was an
accelerated grimace. In his short flurry, he tasted what he called a "thousand
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bitters</ENAMEX>." By his <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">15 th</NUMEX> birthday, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1810</TIMEX>, he had lost both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>, a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">uncles</ENAMEX>. At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guy's Hospital</ENAMEX>, where he trained as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">surgeon</ENAMEX>, he
saw how unprotectedly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> die, and when, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few years later</TIMEX>, he was dying,
rawly, of tuberculosis in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX>, he knew what was ahead. He asked his bedside
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">companion</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Severn</ENAMEX>, if he had ever seen anyone die. No, came the reply.
"Well then," said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keats</ENAMEX>, "I pity you--poor <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Severn</ENAMEX>, what trouble and danger you
have got into for me." He died at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the age of 25 years</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four months</TIMEX>.

            Like
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chekhov</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keats</ENAMEX> was thrust by early <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> experiences into a vicious
individualism that forever strained his metaphysics. While only a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teen-ager</ENAMEX>, he
became responsible, as the eldest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX>, for his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">siblings</ENAMEX>. He struggled between
guilty duty and his growing desire to be a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poet</ENAMEX>. Like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chekhov</ENAMEX>, he lost his
Christianity as swiftly as he lost his own childhood, in favor of an
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unillusioned</ENAMEX> and medical humanism. For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Keats</ENAMEX>, inside every happiness was
trapped a little death. "While we are laughing, the seed of some trouble is put
into the wide arable land of events," he wrote in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1819</TIMEX>. His greatest poems,
most of them written in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that same year</TIMEX>, are elegies wrapped as odes. They
disguise mourning as celebration; they celebrate whatever is going, or gone.
The nightingale <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Keats</ENAMEX> heard in a garden in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 1819</TIMEX> was not the music of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">poetry</ENAMEX>, but the sound of death, a siren call to suicide.

            Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">modernism</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Keatsians</ENAMEX> have felt a need to toughen his
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">textures</ENAMEX>. That puffy lyricism, that gorgeous hysteria of escape ("From silken
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Samarcand</ENAMEX> to cedar'd <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lebanon</ENAMEX>"), that fattened <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">medievalism</ENAMEX>, that quality of
out-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespearing Shakespeare</ENAMEX>, has been hammered by contemporary criticism into
harder shape. The imagination has political responsibilities, goes the lecture,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keats</ENAMEX> acknowledges this in those poems that most seek to escape into the
imagination. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrew Motion</ENAMEX>'s biography, which is well written and often
revelatory, is a product of this apology for the lyric. Using recent
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">scholarship</ENAMEX> (in particular, historicism and cultural materialism), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Motion</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">places Keats</ENAMEX> within the context of the radical liberal politics of the early
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19 th century</TIMEX>.

            There is
much to be said for this, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Motion</ENAMEX> succeeds in recasting our idea of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Keats</ENAMEX>'
political background. Unlike most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> he befriended, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keats</ENAMEX> was of
humble origin (his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> managed an inn and a stable). He did not go to one of
the great boarding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> but to a quirky, dissenting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">establishment</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enfield</ENAMEX>, just north of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX>. Motion gives more attention than any predecessor
to the capillaries of radical politics in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX>, and to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Keats</ENAMEX>' place in a
loose <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of agitating <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> that included <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leigh Hunt</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hazlitt</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shelley</ENAMEX>. It is undeniable that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keats</ENAMEX> made conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enemies</ENAMEX>. All the
negative reviews of his poems were from right-wing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazines</ENAMEX>, and were full of
partisan bristles.

            
But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conservatives</ENAMEX> seem to have largely
disapproved of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> he kept. It is difficult to leap from this to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Motion</ENAMEX>'s settled opinion that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Keats</ENAMEX> "interpret[ed] writing as a humanitarian
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mission</ENAMEX>," or that "he is always engaged with the 'Liberal side of the
Question,' even when sinking most deeply into the imagination." This belief
leads <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Motion</ENAMEX> into many forced readings. The essential difficulty is the
gridlike nature of the historicism that he apparently espouses. From this
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">perspective</ENAMEX>, a poem is seen as a criminal whose alibi is too convincing to be
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">believable</ENAMEX>. A poem, says historicist criticism, will always be riven by the
historical contradictions that surround it. Being a poem, it will want to
escape these contradictions--to ignore them, to smooth them into plausible
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resolution</ENAMEX> or otherwise to smother the scandal of its roots in real history.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critic</ENAMEX>'s task is to interrogate the poem, to bully it into confession. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critic</ENAMEX> then praises the poem not only for confessing but also for having had,
all along, that confession as its real (if buried) subject. The critic
goes off and has a drink, high on self-flattery; the poem is led off in golden
chains.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Motion</ENAMEX> is
clearly a true liberal and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critic</ENAMEX> of acuity. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>, he is known as a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lyric poet</ENAMEX> of considerable power, and this book's style bears the impress of
that talent. But the historicist grid is unrelenting. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> quickly wearies of
it. For instance, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Motion</ENAMEX> tells the story of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Keats</ENAMEX>' creation of his first great
poem, "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">On First Looking Into Chapman's Homer</ENAMEX>." Keats, all of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX>, had returned
to his dingy <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lodgings</ENAMEX> near the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thames</ENAMEX>. It was late, he was tired, but he began
to write quickly: "Much have I travell'd in the realms of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX> ..." The
manuscript shows that he wrote the poem straight out, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> alteration. That
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX>, he dispatched it. It was on the breakfast table of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mentor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Charles</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cowden Clarke</ENAMEX>, by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 a.m.</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Motion</ENAMEX> tells this thrillingly, with a fellow<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">-poet</ENAMEX>'s
hot consanguinity. But the critique that follows is icy: We are warned that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">poem</ENAMEX> admits to a sense of being "challenged or even edged aside by history" (it
does no such thing), and that the title ("<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">On First Looking Into</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chapman</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Homer</ENAMEX>") registers that "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keats</ENAMEX> felt he had come late to high culture."
But that word "first" stamps the poem with a lovely air of aroused virginity,
not one of suspicious belatedness. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keats</ENAMEX> likens himself in this poem to
"stout <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cortez</ENAMEX>," who discovered the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific</ENAMEX>, is he implying that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cortez</ENAMEX> somehow
resented the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pacific</ENAMEX> for existing before he discovered it? <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Motion</ENAMEX>'s zeal as a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">historicist</ENAMEX> makes him neglect his duty as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biographer</ENAMEX>, which is to remind us
that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keats</ENAMEX> was a young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>, and hence a delighted <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX>.

            Too often, one has to pick one's way through this book like
someone playing the white keys on the piano--surrendering to the biographical
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">narration</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Motion</ENAMEX>'s telling of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Keats</ENAMEX>' <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">final months</TIMEX> is superb) and ignoring the
readings of poems. These readings climax in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Motion</ENAMEX>'s discussion of "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">To Autumn</ENAMEX>."
In that famous poem, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Keats</ENAMEX> rubs <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">autumn</TIMEX> with the balm of his moistened language:
"<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Season</TIMEX> of mists and mellow fruitfulness,/ Close bosom-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> of the maturing
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sun</ENAMEX> ..." Keats celebrates an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">autumn</TIMEX> so deliciously warm that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX> have been
fooled into thinking it is still <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX>: "Until they think warm <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> will never
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cease</ENAMEX>,/ For <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Summer</ENAMEX> has o'er-brimmed their clammy cells."

            But for
historicism this is a poem that, in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Motion</ENAMEX>'s words, is "ambitious to transmute
or escape history." And history always seeps back in. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Keats</ENAMEX>' pastoral idealism
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">secretly</ENAMEX> acknowledges that no such ideal exists. Those <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX>, for instance:
Don't they represent "unseen yet discreetly acknowledged labour (the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX> have
been persuaded into working overtime)"? A page <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later</TIMEX>, this has hardened into a
certainty that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX> "are a reminder of the miserable facts of labor that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Keats</ENAMEX> had condemned during his walking tour in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Scotland</ENAMEX> ..." But Keats
describes the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX>' labor as a gentle delusion ("they think warm <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> will
never cease"). In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Motion</ENAMEX>'s reading, "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">To Autumn</ENAMEX>" is really about the inequities
of agricultural labor. The shame is not so much the obvious absurdity as that
such a reading, clutching at alien <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">abstractions</ENAMEX>, finds no place to observe the
perfect specificity of describing honeycombs as "clammy cells."

            
In fact, there is a toughness to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keats</ENAMEX>,
but it is a metaphysical toughness rather than a political one. Historicism
works on a moral hierarchy, in which political suffering is more important than
metaphysical suffering or simply incorporates it, and in which "history" is
more important than "time" or "life." But in his long, moving letter-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journal</ENAMEX> of
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 1819</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Keats</ENAMEX> explicitly raises metaphysical suffering over political or
material travails. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Materially</ENAMEX>, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keats</ENAMEX>, we are always wanting. But that is
not the burden: "And if he improves by degrees his bodily accommodations and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comforts</ENAMEX>--at each <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stage</ENAMEX>, at each accent there are waiting for him a fresh set
of annoyances--he is mortal and there is still a heaven with its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stars</ENAMEX> above
his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX>." After politics, there are the gods to deal with.

            What moves us in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Keats</ENAMEX> is
precisely this checkered metaphysics--the haunting apprehension that the seed
planted in the "wide arable land of events" might be the seed of death, not
life. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Keats</ENAMEX> is famous for his odes, which are taken to be celebrations; but
they are not. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keats</ENAMEX> looks at the painted figures and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> on the Grecian
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">urn</ENAMEX> (in "Ode on a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grecian Urn</ENAMEX>"), he is not just happy that these apparitions
will never fade, because they are art, and thus permanent; he is happy that
they have never had to live, that they are not suffering: "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ah</ENAMEX>, happy, happy
boughs! that cannot shed/ Your <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">leaves</ENAMEX>, nor ever bid the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spring</ENAMEX> adieu ..." "To
Autumn" is not just disturbed by a sense that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">autumn</TIMEX> will inevitably pass into
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">winter</ENAMEX>; it is an elegy for lost <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX>. Even the "small gnats mourn" this
passing. And "Ode to a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nightingale</ENAMEX>," which meditates on suicide, is an elegy
for himself: "Now more than ever seems it rich to die,/ To cease upon the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">midnight</ENAMEX> with no pain."

            Yes, in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Keats</ENAMEX>' poems, life
has a dreamy quality--but this is not a gorgeous swoon so much as the sense
that somewhere, out of sight, we have already lived our actual lives, and that
the life we are forced to feel through now is a posthumous remembrance of that
earlier life, full of pain and loss. "Do I wake or sleep<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">?</ENAMEX>" asks <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keats</ENAMEX> at the
end of "Ode to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nightingale</ENAMEX>." It is one of the most cherished questions in
Romantic poetry. But there is nothing benign in this question; it is an echo of
"To be, or not to be?" It is a self-challenge, not a soft quibble. Less than
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years later</TIMEX>, on his deathbed, terribly ill and desirous of death, Keats
asked just the same question in one of his last letters: "Is there another
life? Shall I awake and find all this a dream? There must be, we cannot be
created for this sort of suffering."
