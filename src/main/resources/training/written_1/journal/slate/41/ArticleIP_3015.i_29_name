            There are some epic moments
in this slim volume--memories of bitterness and shame magnified by the
fly-thick heat of the western <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cape</ENAMEX>. Boyhood: <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Scenes From Provincial Life</ENAMEX>
by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J.M. Coetzee</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Booker</ENAMEX> Prize-winning white <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">South African</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">novelist</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Waiting for the Barbarians</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1980</TIMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Life & Times of</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michael K</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1983</TIMEX>), tells of barren spaces. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of these is a small
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">town</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Worcester</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Coetzee</ENAMEX> spent part of his childhood and where
nothing grows. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Cape Town</ENAMEX>, where his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> returned
after a stint in the hinterland and where dead <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">babies</ENAMEX> rot in brown paper
packets.

            Part <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> of
an autobiographical trilogy, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boyhood</ENAMEX> is the story of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> forced to
endure and imagine his way out of that barrenness. It is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX>'s memoir,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">minutely</ENAMEX> detailed and finely polished. Framed by a dystopic <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">post-World War II</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Africa</ENAMEX>--where the economy has moved from rural to urban, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Afrikaner</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nationalists</ENAMEX> have risen to power, and apartheid is testing its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wings</ENAMEX>--the story
airs these larger happenings through the muggy lives of its young protagonist
(the book spans <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years 10 through 13</TIMEX>) and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>: his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>, a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nonpracticing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> whom he despises; his mother, who is too close to him
and to whom he is too close; and a younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX>, who he suspects may, at
heart, be normal.

            This last, you understand, is not a good thing. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Normalcy,</ENAMEX>
to which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">John the memoirist</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> is doomed and against which his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> is
his own last bastion, must be avoided at all costs. On young <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John</ENAMEX>'s rejection
of "normal," that twee, tired word, turns the action of this book. He can
isolate his every sensation, indulge his every impulse, in the untested space
on either side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">l</ENAMEX> . He identifies himself as a
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman Catholic</ENAMEX>--not because he is one (his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> is nondenominationally
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX>) but "because of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX>, because of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Horatius</ENAMEX> and his <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">comrades</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">swords</ENAMEX> in their hands, crested helmets on their heads, indomitable courage in
their glance, defending the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX> ... against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Etruscan</ENAMEX> hordes." The
<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">bathetic</ENAMEX> discovery that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman Catholicism</ENAMEX> has little to do with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Horatius</ENAMEX> has no
effect on his philosophy of life (asked to choose between the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russians</ENAMEX> and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>, he chooses the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russians</ENAMEX> as he chose <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX>, because of the letter
r , "particularly the capital <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> , the strongest of all letters");
but there's a larger reality that will not be ignored: the fact that he,
thinking only of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leonidas</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thermopylae</ENAMEX>, has by his choice of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">faiths</ENAMEX> isolated
himself in a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Protestant</ENAMEX>-majority <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>. From <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that day</TIMEX> forward, his social
options are severely limited--to the other outcasts, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenberg</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goldstein</ENAMEX>,
who are, like him, in a despised religious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minority</ENAMEX>.

            Isolation
and introspection, those staples of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bildungsroman</ENAMEX> , scrape at young
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coetzee</ENAMEX>'s sensibilities, refining them raw. Exposure--of ignorance, of soft
pink feet in a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">classroom</ENAMEX> of callused soles--is anathema. Lessons must be
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mastered</ENAMEX> and feet remain shod. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ugliness</ENAMEX> and sloth thin the nostrils and raise
the gorge. Appearances must be maintained and the desperately unhappy worlds of
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> and school kept separate, and they almost are. Above all is the yearning
for greatness, for acts of wondrous <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">heroism</ENAMEX>. But shy, brainy, and unpopular,
Coetzee must make do with hyperbolic fantasy instead:

            The
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> from the water-bottle is magically cool, but he pours no more than a
mouthful at a time. He is proud of how little he drinks. It will stand him in
good stead, he hopes, if he is ever lost in the veld. He wants to be a creature
of the desert, this desert, like a lizard.

            
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boyhood</ENAMEX>'s grand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">fumblings</ENAMEX> put me in mind of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">V.S. Naipaul</ENAMEX>'s semiautobiographical novel <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A House</ENAMEX> for Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Biswas</ENAMEX> , whose
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">protagonist</ENAMEX> is similarly prone to self-romanticization. Like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Coetzee</ENAMEX>, Naipaul
has been accused of avoiding politics when he writes. That's a mystifying
charge: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Biswas</ENAMEX>' paranoias, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">magistrate</ENAMEX>'s coming apart in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Coetzee</ENAMEX>'s
Waiting for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barbarians</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antihero</ENAMEX>'s inability to connect with the
world around him in his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Life & Times of Michael K</ENAMEX> , are all directly
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">traceable</ENAMEX> to the traumas of political change and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX>'s need to find
stability within it.

            Likewise,
there is no mistaking the political underpinnings of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boyhood</ENAMEX> . There are
cozy images of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John</ENAMEX>'s obsession with <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">cricket</ENAMEX> ("not a game ... the truth
of life"), his description of beloved train rides ("sleeping snug and tight
under the crisp white sheets and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">navy</ENAMEX>-blue blankets that the bedding attendant
brings"). There are scenes from provincial life that derive from absolute
hierarchies, which, in turn, are built on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manichaean</ENAMEX> oppositions: The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Afrikaners</ENAMEX>, with whom he must share a last name, are <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">crude</ENAMEX>, their language
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">filthy</ENAMEX> beyond belief. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coloureds</ENAMEX>, fathered by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX> upon <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hottentots</ENAMEX>, are
poor and therefore good, naturally qualified by their lack of book-learning to
fix a broken gadget or a leaky faucet. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Natives</ENAMEX>, rightful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> of the
land, are immutable, their pithy pidginisms (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">"Man</ENAMEX> builds great <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> of iron,
but the sea is stronger") deserving of the utmost reverence ("You must remember
what he said. He was a wise old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>," intones Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Coetzee</ENAMEX>--this, observes
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John</ENAMEX>, is the only time he has heard his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> use the word "wise"). Atop this
heap are the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX>, the fascinating, remote <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who have not
fallen into a rage because they live behind walls and guard their hearts well."
The stereotyping is powerful, the more so because it appears deceptively
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unquestioned</ENAMEX>.

            There is explicit racism, too. What, for example, does one
do with a cup sullied by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coloured</ENAMEX> lips? Does one wash it, or does one discard
it? (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> bleaches it.) It is among these careful calibrations that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John</ENAMEX> must
come into his own. Painfully aware of the limitations of class, occasionally
able to peer outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prison house</ENAMEX> of race, he strains to exceed his
inheritance. He despairs of his father the failed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gunner</ENAMEX> who can't
hit a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bird</ENAMEX> that doesn't bother with flight, the pajama-clad alcoholic who
squelches his cigarettes in his own excrement. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> copes, as any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX> would,
by leaving out the details that most offend him. When he tells his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>
about his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>'s service in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">South African</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX> during <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX>, for
instance, he drops the "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">lance</ENAMEX>" before "corporal." But the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> remains
common. He cannot aspire.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>, however, is
another matter. She has tragic potential. She lives in fear of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX>;
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">adores Ingrid Bergman</ENAMEX>; learns to ride a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bike</ENAMEX>, then, ridiculed by her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>,
abandons it. Underneath it all is her rock-solid, oppressive devotion to her
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX>. Her tolerance feeds his tantrums, her servitude his warped sense of self.
She, like him, is denied wholeness by her downwardly mobile <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lot</ENAMEX> and remains
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fluttery</ENAMEX> and distracted almost to the last, when she has the moment of clarity
her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> has dreaded. Unlike the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>, however, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> can and did flee into
his books and beyond--to the pastoral beauty of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandfather</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">farm</ENAMEX>, for
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>, and toward his future. Not that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coetzee</ENAMEX> invites you to celebrate with him.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boyhood</ENAMEX> , as in his other work, astringence remains his first
principle. Frosty of tone, flinty of edge, he doesn't tell you what to feel or
how to escape. You're on your own.
