            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cartier</ENAMEX> name connotes
luxurious objects, but none in particular. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Faberg√©</ENAMEX> means enameled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Easter</ENAMEX> eggs
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tiffany</ENAMEX> means wedding presents and engagement rings--maybe art noveau
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lamps</ENAMEX>--but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cartier</ENAMEX> means, well, expensive jewelry in the abstract. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX> has
always been a retail business, the product of commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enterprise</ENAMEX> rather than
aesthetic vision--a glorified jewelry store. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis-Fran√ßois Cartier</ENAMEX> founded the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1847</TIMEX>, just in time to help deck the famous beauties of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Second</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Empire</ENAMEX>, from the empress to the great cocottes. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Branches</ENAMEX> were soon opened in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis-Fran√</ENAMEX>ßois' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sons</ENAMEX> to serve Victorian <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">magnates</ENAMEX> on both
sides of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX>, and eventually a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cartier</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandson</ENAMEX> married the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">granddaughter of Worth</ENAMEX>, the world famous couturier , as if to consolidate
the whole international luxury-goods <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX>.

            Meanwhile
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cartier</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX> ranged far, seeking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Imperial Russia</ENAMEX> and among
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">maharajahs</ENAMEX>, buying enamels from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> and pearls from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> to sell to
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clients</ENAMEX>. For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nearly 150 years</TIMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branches</ENAMEX> provided jewels to
suit the varied tastes of the world's multimillionaires--without ever imposing
a distinct artistic style on any of them. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">client</ENAMEX> was invited to participate
in the creation of a given piece; his or her sketches were considered; his or
her <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stones</ENAMEX> might be used. But to establish a solid worldwide reputation among
the aesthetically alert and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">crude</ENAMEX> alike, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cartier</ENAMEX> employed a single unifying
principle: the highest quality of materials and workmanship, and a single
standard of elegance.

            Which means that the stuff risked being stuffy, if you can
say that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about jeweled</NUMEX> ornaments. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cartier</ENAMEX>'s defining epoch was the art deco
period, which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designers</ENAMEX> seem to have anticipated by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two decades</TIMEX> and
extended through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1930s</TIMEX>. Beginning in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1907</TIMEX>, they were already using
recognizable art deco forms, but clearly not as signs of revolutionary
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">modernity</ENAMEX>. The simple shapes and lines were being offered rather as extensions
of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late 18 th century</TIMEX> neoclassicism, as new bearers of old values. No
wonder they were popular with both nouveaux riches and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">royalty</ENAMEX>.

            The
current <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cartier</ENAMEX> exhibition at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metropolitan Museum of Art</ENAMEX> is confined to
pieces made <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1900 and 1939</TIMEX>, the period of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cartier</ENAMEX>'s greatest fame. Most
of the show demonstrates <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cartier</ENAMEX>'s adherence to an old-fashioned view of
jewels. Take tiaras, for example. The tiara (that is, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>'s ornamental
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">crown</ENAMEX> of a more or less crescent shape) is not at all modern, but it is
definitely both classical and neoclassical. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sappho</ENAMEX> wore <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>. So did <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nero</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mother</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Agrippina the Younger, and Napoleon's Josephine</ENAMEX>. Thanks to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cartier</ENAMEX>, so
apparently did every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commoner</ENAMEX> who could afford it <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1900 and 1939</TIMEX>, to
match the royals and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nobles</ENAMEX> who had inherited theirs.

            
Royalty was still big news in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first half</TIMEX> of
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this century</TIMEX>. High-level elegance, then epitomized by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cartier</ENAMEX>, manifestly
required the effect that made <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Napoleon</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">upstart court</ENAMEX> look imperial and
legitimate. That look--simple yet richly paved with glitter and colored enamel,
altogether different from the frothy rococo excesses of the ancien

               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">r√©gime</ENAMEX> --also suited <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>'s steel, railway, or breakfast-food
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">emperors</ENAMEX> and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">descendants</ENAMEX> and emulators in the succeeding <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX>.
Tiaras, imposing necklaces, multiple bracelets, everything in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diamonds</ENAMEX>--it all
still held good, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cartier</ENAMEX> kept it up.

            But the
whole idea is now pass√©. It lingered into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1950s</TIMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Grace Kelly</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Audrey</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hepburn</ENAMEX> gave it a whirl, but it's really gone now. A dazzling array of
hereditary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jewels</ENAMEX> might occasionally adorn <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Queen Elizabeth</ENAMEX>, but other rich
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> never appear in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diamond tiaras</ENAMEX>. Figure skaters and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ballet dancers</ENAMEX> are the
only ones who wear them, along with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miss America</ENAMEX>.

            My understanding of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cartier</ENAMEX> was so nebulous that I thought
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an hour</TIMEX> would suffice to check out the show at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metropolitan Museum</ENAMEX>. I
strode briskly up to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> glass case--but there I stopped, transfixed. In
the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> cases were <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diamond brooches</ENAMEX> made to adorn the spacious dresses
of the belle 
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">√©poque</ENAMEX> , gleaming leaf-and-flower <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">compositions</ENAMEX> that
could sweep across a whole d√©colletage from shoulder to shoulder, or smaller
ornaments festooned with graceful <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diamond swags</ENAMEX> and dripping with pendant
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diamond</ENAMEX> drops. Each piece was an entire show, dazzling under the lights. But
there was more.

            Each
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diamond</ENAMEX> in each leaf and petal was surrounded by a tiny wall of platinum
beading, in what I learned is called the "millegrain" setting. No <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">crude</ENAMEX> prongs
hold up these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stones</ENAMEX>, but rather, a precise silvery tracing that sets off the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diamond</ENAMEX> and emphasizes the interlaced design of the brooch while hiding its
construction. Out of sight at the back, the grainy tracing around the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stones</ENAMEX> is
held up on a continuous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">gallery</ENAMEX> of supports rising from another tracery that
lies against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diamonds</ENAMEX> are lifted up on an airy <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cage</ENAMEX>, and light
can come through them from below.

            
I was repeatedly struck by how unlike these
Cartier creations are to modern rhinestone jewelry, or even to modern precious
jewelry. Today, the seriousness is missing. When it comes to style in jewels,
modern chic has followed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chanel</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chanel</ENAMEX> refused to be solemn. She insisted
on casual fakes and mixtures of vivid barbaric ornaments along with real
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pearls</ENAMEX>. Cartier <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jewels</ENAMEX> were once sought expressly for their link to a tradition
of exquisite applied craftmanship, as the best celebration of precious
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">minerals</ENAMEX>, something undertaken almost for their sake. Modern vanity is more
personal; we no longer want to wear ornaments with that detached eternal look.
The designs for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cartier</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jewels</ENAMEX> have a consistent discretion. These are
never expressions of wild <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genius</ENAMEX>, like the beating heart made of rubies that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dali</ENAMEX> designed. On the contrary, respect for the capacity of the materials
always wins out over daring visual invention, but a staggering technical
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">imagination</ENAMEX> has also been summoned. That, if anywhere, is where the modernity
of these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jewels</ENAMEX> lies.

            I
learned, for example, how a diadem, brooch, or bracelet could be invisibly
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hinged</ENAMEX> so as to be completely flexible in all directions, not a rigid little
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">beast</ENAMEX> of unyielding metal and stone, but supple, tender toward the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">changeable</ENAMEX> in mood. I saw in the catalog how the lengthy diamond necklaces with
complex pendants were often made to be disassembled by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">client</ENAMEX>, so she could
have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> bracelets, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> brooches, and a shorter necklace whenever she got
tired of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> big thing. Meanwhile her tiara, just right for attending the
coronation of a monarch, could be dismounted from its frame and reversed into a
necklace suitable for the opening of the opera season. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jewels</ENAMEX> would be
delivered in exquisite gold-tooled leather boxes with compartments containing
the relevant alternative mounts and fastenings, and a tiny screwdriver in its
own velvet <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">nest</ENAMEX>.

            As I stared into the cases, I often heard "Oh my God!" next
to me or behind me, uttered in an undertone with a note of awe. I was tempted
to misquote <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mae West</ENAMEX>: "God has nothing to do with it, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">honey</ENAMEX>." Here we abandon
him in the heady presence of treasures laid up on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">earth</ENAMEX>, material wealth in
its most concentrated and enduring form. A <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diamond</ENAMEX> bracelet mocks all the
sables that wither and rot, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> that rust, the champagne gone flat, and
the claret turned vinegar, even the crumbling great <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> and the faded great
paintings--painstaking creations now fatally ripped, soaked, or burned.
Lifeless from the start, jewels sneer at death, and they require zero
maintenance.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cartier</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX> kept
its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jewels</ENAMEX> on the move. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">client</ENAMEX> might lose at cards, and the gold cigarette
case with sapphires would be sold back to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cartier</ENAMEX>, who would promptly sell it
the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</TIMEX> to another gentleman. A ruby-and-diamond necklace might have to
go for inheritance taxes: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cartier</ENAMEX> would buy it back, dismantle it entirely, and
make it into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> tiaras and a brooch for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clients</ENAMEX>, maybe preserving
some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> and using them upside down or sideways. Each piece was
photographed for the archives, against just such a fate.

            The
cosmetics-and-smoking mania of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">'20s</NUMEX> resulted in a whole array of
gem-studded vanity cases with built-in lipstick, comb, and compartment for
cigarettes. These were meant to be carried in the palm of the hand at the ball
or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX>, and deployed in front of everybody, their gold interiors
with their clever little hinges flashing while the nose was dusted, the mouth
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">repainted</ENAMEX>, or a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sobranie</ENAMEX> selected. You had to take it back to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cartier</ENAMEX> to get
the lipstick refilled, and you held onto it with a little ring or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> that
hooked over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> fingers.

            
None of these has much current appeal, luxe
notwithstanding. Of things we would like, whole categories are oddly
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">underrepresented</ENAMEX>. There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">well over 200</NUMEX> pieces in this show, but <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only six</NUMEX>
pairs of earrings, all very drippy ones from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the '20s</TIMEX>. Where are the little
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diamond</ENAMEX> floral clusters for the lobe, the neat ruby circles? And there are
exactly <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> rings. Obviously all the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Cartier</ENAMEX> rings are still in use, and all
the little earrings fell off in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">taxi</ENAMEX>.

            I came
home drained and exhausted from thinking about how to adjust my diadem and
reassemble my lavaliere, and unable to choose between the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ribbon</NUMEX>-knot
brooch with the rubies and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gothic</ENAMEX>-style double-circle brooch with the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sapphires</ENAMEX>. The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next day</TIMEX>, fully recovered, I saw the photo in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> of the
opening <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX>. And there was one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cartier</ENAMEX>'s glorious tiaras on loan, crowning
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6-foot</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African-American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX> wearing the perfect silvery backless
gown to go with it--but alas, she had to be followed everywhere by security
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guards</ENAMEX>. Nevertheless, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tiara</ENAMEX> looked nothing at all like the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miss America</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">crown</ENAMEX>, and I must admit I felt a stab of envy.
