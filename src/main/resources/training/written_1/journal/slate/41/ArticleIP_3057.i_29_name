            In his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1755</TIMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dictionary</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samuel Johnson</ENAMEX> derided the idea that a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">dictionary</ENAMEX> "can
embalm his language, and secure it from corruption and decay, that it is in his
power to change sublunary nature, and clear the world at once from folly,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vanity</ENAMEX>, and affectation." Few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> know what he meant by the lovely
word sublunary . Literally, it means "beneath the moon," and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX> was
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alluding</ENAMEX> to an ancient, widespread belief that there was an unbreachable
division between the cosmos, thought to be pristine, lawful, and unchanging,
and our grubby, chaotic <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX> below. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX> was already obsolete by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Johnson</ENAMEX>'s time: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Newton</ENAMEX> had shown that a single set of laws pulled the apple
toward the ground and kept the moon in its orbit around <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">E.O.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> has chosen another lovely but little-known word, consilience , as
the title and theme of his new book. Literally "jumping together," consilience
means the linking of facts and theory across disciplines into a single coherent
system of explanation. That sounds innocuous, but it has a radical implication:
that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">divisions</ENAMEX> between nature and society, matter and mind, biology and
culture, and the sciences and the humanities, arts, and social sciences are as
obsolete as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX> between the sublunary and supralunary spheres.

            For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX>, the progress of science has been a story of
increasing consilience. The collapse of the wall between the terrestrial and
celestial was followed by a collapse of the once equally firm (and now equally
forgotten) wall between the past, when divine cataclysms were supposed to have
shaped the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">earth</ENAMEX>, and the present, with its seemingly permanent mountains and
oceans. Less than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a century</TIMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">geologist</ENAMEX> Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Lyell</ENAMEX>
showed that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX> could have been sculpted by everyday erosion,
earthquakes, and volcanoes acting in the past over immense spans of time. The
living and nonliving, too, no longer occupy different realms. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Two centuries</TIMEX>
before <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lyell</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Harvey</ENAMEX> showed the human body to be a machine
that uses hydraulics and other mechanical principles. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lyell</ENAMEX>'s contemporary, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chemist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Friedrich WÃ¶hler</ENAMEX>, showed with his synthesis of urea that the
stuff of life is not a magical gel but ordinary compounds following the laws of
chemistry. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Darwin</ENAMEX> showed how the astonishing diversity of life and its
ubiquitous signs of design could arise from the physical process of the natural
selection of replicators. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gregor Mendel</ENAMEX>, and then <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James D. Watson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis</ENAMEX>
Crick, showed how replication itself could be understood in physical terms.

            For
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX>, the final chasm that separates biology from the humanities will be
bridged by an understanding of human nature that comes from neuroscience,
psychology, and evolutionary biology. Human thoughts and feelings are patterns
of activity of the brain, whose design is a product of natural selection. The
brain was "engineered" as a dynamic neural computer that calculated the
strategies of survival and reproduction needed by our evolutionary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ancestors</ENAMEX>.
As <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> discovered things about their world and each other and shared these
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">discoveries</ENAMEX>, and as they instituted conventions and rules to coordinate their
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">desires</ENAMEX>, the phenomenon called "culture" arose.

            
Culture and society, then, are not autonomous
forces but products of minds interacting with one another, and culture evolved
along with the brain. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sociology</ENAMEX> and anthropology are the study of the products
of the human tendency to form clans, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partnerships</ENAMEX>, and coalitions. Economics
ideally would be based on real human preferences and decision-making strategies
(rather than the idealized "rational <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX>" assumed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> today).
Literature comes from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>'s obsession with universal life-and-death themes
such as kinship, danger, and rivalry. Art depends on an innate eye for optimal
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">habitats</ENAMEX> and forms, and on the biases of our visual systems. Morality comes
from the sense of empathy and the internalized standards that allow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to
live harmoniously in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>.

            Science
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> often experience the exhilarating realization that the laws of the
whole world fit together. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> refers to that blessed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> as the Ionian
Enchantment, after the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">6 th</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">B.C.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX> of the physical
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sciences, Thales of Ionia</ENAMEX>. Like many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> had an Ionian
Enchantment as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX>, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Consilience</ENAMEX> comes from a second
enchantment he experienced in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1970s</TIMEX>, when he was already an esteemed
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">entomologist</ENAMEX>. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Click</ENAMEX> to see how he uses entomology--the ultimate multicultural
curriculum--to open his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX>' eyes to the dependence of human culture on
human nature.) Evolutionary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biologists</ENAMEX> had recently worked out the implications
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Darwin</ENAMEX>'s theory for the social lives of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>. Former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">paradoxes</ENAMEX> of
animal behavior such as cooperation, sexuality, aggression, pacifism, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">communication</ENAMEX> were being increasingly understood in terms of the natural
selection of genes. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> wrote a famous book in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1975</TIMEX> called Sociobiology:
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Synthesis</ENAMEX> , and he later extended it with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">bits</NUMEX> of psychology and
mathematical modeling to yield a theory he called "gene-culture
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coevolution</ENAMEX>."

            Not everyone was enchanted. Angry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> charged that if
the mind had an innate structure, different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> (or classes, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sexes</ENAMEX>, and
races) could have different innate structures, justifying discrimination. They
said that if obnoxious behaviors such as aggression and clannishness were
innate, that would make them "natural" and hence good; or, even if bad, they
would be "in the genes" and hence unchangeable, subverting hopes for social
reform. They said that if behavior were caused mainly by the genes, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>
could not be held responsible for their actions. Some of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX>
expressed their disagreement by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dousing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pitcher</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> at a
scientific convention, yelling for his dismissal over bullhorns, urging people
to bring noisemakers to his lectures, and publishing righteous manifestoes and
sarcastic, book-length denunciations.

            In fact,
many of the accusations--for example, that he was really trying to justify male
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">philandering</ENAMEX>--were simply preposterous, and others could be countered easily.
Innate similarities do not imply innate differences. Genetically influenced
behavior is not necessarily good and not necessarily unchangeable. Explanations
of bad behavior that appeal to genes do not absolve a person any more than do
explanations that appeal to upbringing.

            
Life has been kinder to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wilson</ENAMEX> since then. He
won <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pulitzers</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">for On Human Nature</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1978</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Ants</ENAMEX> ,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX>). His articulate advocacy of biodiversity and his graceful autobiography
( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Naturalist</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX>) changed his image in the popular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">press</ENAMEX> from bad guy
to good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX>. His insights on sociobiology, minus the inflammatory connotations,
have become widely accepted in new fields such as behavioral ecology and
evolutionary psychology.

            The tide
has turned so much that one might wonder whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> needs to make such a
fuss about the unity of knowledge. I can confirm he does, for I have tried to
convey the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ionian Enchantment</ENAMEX> in my recent book <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">How the Mind Works</ENAMEX>. Anyone
who thinks that consilience is banal or obvious is invited to read my debates with the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sociologist Alan Wolfe</ENAMEX> in 
                  Slate
                and with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biologist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven</ENAMEX>
Rose in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Edge</ENAMEX>. (Or click to read my summary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wolfe's</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rose</ENAMEX>'s
positions.)

            Even <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> who share <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wilson</ENAMEX>'s worldview will find much to
provoke them. I felt <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> was sometimes too complacent in seeing human
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">foibles</ENAMEX> (such as irrational spiritual beliefs) as evolutionarily adaptive. I
was not persuaded that moral statements can be reduced to psychology, as if the
disapproval of murder were just another human taste like the preference for
sweet over bitter <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX>. (Even a die-hard <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ionian</ENAMEX> might think that our moral
sense evolved to grasp a logic of morality that is outside our minds in the
same sense that our number sense evolved to grasp mathematical truths that are
outside our minds.) I was unconvinced that a case for preserving species
diversity can rest on our innate love of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>-rich, savanna-like ancestral
environment. I fear that, if it meant avoiding widespread economic
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dislocations</ENAMEX>, most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> would be happy to consummate their desire to commune
with <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> with a visit to a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">golf course stocked</ENAMEX> with a few pandas
and eagles. For this reason, the concluding chapter, which urges urgent
intervention to stop environmental degradation, felt out of place--though it is
the most thoughtful and persuasive such argument I have seen.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Consilience</ENAMEX> is, in any
case, an excellent book. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> provides superb overviews of Western
intellectual history and of the current state of understanding in many academic
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">disciplines</ENAMEX>. Though he forcefully presses his case toward a conclusion many
will find radical, the tone is calm and respectful and the writing style gentle
and inviting.
