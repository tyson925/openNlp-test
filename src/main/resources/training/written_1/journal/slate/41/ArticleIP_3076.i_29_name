            A sphinx has the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> of a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lion</ENAMEX> and the face of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>. Why is this no good? Simple: Because in order to
have a face, you need a pair of hands. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paws</ENAMEX> won't do. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Animals</ENAMEX> with paws must
have big, furry, jutting muzzles, which rule out a face. They need muzzles for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">biting</ENAMEX>, to defend themselves, and to attack prey, whereas possessors of hands
can fashion and chuck a spear or throw a punch. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Animals</ENAMEX> need muzzles to carry
things and to gnaw on their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX>, whereas possessors of hands can make a fire
to tenderize their viands. And in order to have growing scalp hair--as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>
uniquely do--you need to have hands to cut it, lest it get so long that it
jeopardizes your survival. So faces presuppose hands. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sphinxes</ENAMEX> and centaurs and
other countenanced but handless <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">creatures</ENAMEX> not only do not exist, they could
not exist.

            That exciting aperçu
occurred to me in the course of reading <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Face and The Hand</ENAMEX> ,
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> books that otherwise brought me unremitting boredom. Well, almost
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unremitting</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Face</ENAMEX> made me cringe a lot. Its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel McNeill</ENAMEX>,
won a science-writing prize <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few years ago</TIMEX>, and this seems to have gone to his
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX>. His prose oozes a kind of rotten poetry, and no observation is too banal
to be left unspoken.

            Take
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McNeill</ENAMEX>'s extended meditation on kissing--please:

            A kiss can pour love from
lips to lips, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> receptacles filling each other. ... The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lovers</ENAMEX>' tongues
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">caress</ENAMEX> each other, dance about the teeth and inner cheeks, bathe in each
other's oral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fluids</ENAMEX>. ... <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Long</ENAMEX>, luxurious <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">smooches</ENAMEX> can end in a sound like
planes of glass rubbing, or even in a cheep. ... <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Family members</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX>
commonly kiss. ... The kiss is often a gesture of greeting.

            I didn't
know all that, did you?

            As for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">The Hand</ENAMEX> , by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neurologist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank R.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX>, even the epigraphs are tedious. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of them reads:

            The true
relevance of lateralization of function will be ascertained only by careful
research that acknowledges that aspects of this function develop throughout the
life span, beginning at birth, if not before.

            Try as I
might, I can detect no lambent flicker of humor in these pages.

            There are
some scattered interesting bits in both <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Face and The Hand</ENAMEX> ,
however. Someone ought to extract and put them in a concise form, to save
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> the trouble of reading the books. In fact, that's what I'll do.

            
Let's begin with the chin. It is a singularly
human facial feature, one that even the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Neanderthals</ENAMEX> lacked. The chin seems to
have emerged around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">130,000 years ago</TIMEX>. Why? <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Scientists</ENAMEX> have no idea. What they
do know, however, is that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>'s chins have been getting larger over the last
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX>. They have a theory for this. The male chin grows during
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">puberty</ENAMEX> in response to testosterone. Testosterone weakens the immune system.
So, paradoxically, a big chin on a healthy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> is an advertisement of
robustness: It means that, despite an excess of testosterone, his immune system
is still powerful enough to fight off disease. Therefore <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> should fancy a
big chin on a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mate</ENAMEX>, and the trait is sexually selected. (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Insert Jay Leno</ENAMEX> joke
here.) I do not know whether this theory is true. I do know that in good
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">society</ENAMEX>, chins are very important. Style largely depends on the way the chin is
worn. They are worn very high at present.

            If the
face has been getting longer at the bottom over the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX>, it has been
getting shorter (and broader) on top. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McNeill</ENAMEX> does not mention this, but it is
true. The trend is called brachycephalization, and it has been happening mainly
in rural <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX> between the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Carpathian Mountains</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Black Sea</ENAMEX>--which, for
some arcane reason, is one of the few places on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX> where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> are still
evolving. (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anthropologists</ENAMEX> discovered this by examining skeletons from the
region going back to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1300</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 30</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX>.) The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Darwinian</ENAMEX> advantage of
having a shorter <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX>, if any, remains unknown. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tribes</ENAMEX> have gone
for the same effect by a horrific sort of plastic surgery. The Choctaws
flattened the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heads</ENAMEX> of babies by placing bags of sand on their brows and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ridiculed whites</ENAMEX> as "longheads." By contrast, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nefertiti</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Akhenaton</ENAMEX>,
seems to have had her cranium artificially stretched for beauty's sake.

            Did this really make her beautiful? What renders a face
truly soul-bewitching? Whatever it is, it transcends culture, despite what
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Naomi Wolf</ENAMEX> may try to tell you. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> everywhere share the same criteria of
facial beauty. This conclusion is supported by a wealth of studies over the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last 15 years</TIMEX> in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> from different cultures have been asked to
rate photos for beauty. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> prefer the same
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanic</ENAMEX> and black <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> agree on which newly arrived <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asian</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> are the genuine babes, and so on.

            The key
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ingredient</ENAMEX> seems to be averageness. The most ordinary features are,
aesthetically, the most extraordinary. If you use a computer to merge a lot of
faces together, the result tends to look as fetching as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leonardo DiCaprio</ENAMEX>. This
effect was first noticed when a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">19 th</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">eugenicist</ENAMEX> tried to
create an average criminal face by making a photographic composite of lots of
mug shots. The "prototypical criminal" turned out to be way too handsome.

            
There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> evolutionary advantages to
looking average. One is that potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mates</ENAMEX> can be sure you're a human and,
hence, biologically worth mating with. (Remember, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Homo sapiens</ENAMEX> lived side by
side with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Neanderthals</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">many thousands</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, and we differed from them
chiefly in the face.) <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, average facial features are a sign of good <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>,
of being close to the optimal design favored by natural selection.

            But some
faces are even more pleasing than the average face. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Women</ENAMEX> are judged to be
beautiful when they have larger than average <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pupils</ENAMEX> and retroussé noses; such
babyish features suggest that most of their childbearing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> are still ahead.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Full</TIMEX> lips are a plus, probably because they reflect high estrogen levels and
thus high fertility. Contrariwise, masculinized features in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>--like a
large, angular jaw--signal too much testosterone, which reduces fertility.

            Our faces are fur-less and exposed to the world so that
they can be read. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheaters</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">liars</ENAMEX> imperil the cooperative enterprises
necessary for survival, but they give themselves away by their skewed facial
expressions. The most important facial muscles are not under the control of the
will. A fake smile is seldom persuasive--it lasts too long, it looks wrong
around the eyes. Even at the corners of the mouth, the phony smile betrays
itself by being subtly lopsided: Involuntary expressions, arising in the lower,
unitary brain, affect both sides of the mouth equally, but willed expressions
are governed by the cerebral hemispheres, the dominant of which sends a
stronger signal.

            There is
much maundering in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Face</ENAMEX> about the face of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mona Lisa</ENAMEX> , the
face of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus</ENAMEX>, the face of God. I have not seen the face of God, but I have
seen a certain <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> literary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> who looks like the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Wrath of God</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T></ENAMEX>he Hand tells the affecting story of how the thumb
rose from being just another digit to being opposable. For our simian ancestors
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>, falling from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> to branch was a normal mode of locomotion,
but you had better have a prehensile paw for grabbing the crucial limb at the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last moment</TIMEX>. When we landed on the ground, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hands</ENAMEX> were first employed in
knuckle-walking, later in juggling and brain surgery.

            The most
interesting thing about the human hand is the phenomenon of "hand dominance,"
which, like speech and toolmaking, is unknown among apes. Why are we either
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">righties</ENAMEX> or lefties, and why in the ratio of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">9-to-1</NUMEX>? Is it this asymmetry in
the use of our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hands</ENAMEX>--one of which is "good," the other relatively
disabled--that points up their intimate alliance with the brain, whose two
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hemispheres</ENAMEX> (each controlling a different hand) are similarly specialized?

            It may well be that the hands molded the brain, not vice
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">versa</ENAMEX>, the stimulus being the all-important activity of marksmanship: throwing
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missiles</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prey</ENAMEX>. One amusing (but untestable) hypothesis has it that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX>
were the principal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hunters</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">savanna</ENAMEX> and that they invariably
threw with their right arms, because they were carrying their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">babies</ENAMEX> in their
left arms up against their hearts, the beating of which soothed and quieted the
infant. In any case, the secret of manual dexterity is all in the
timing--hitting the piano key or releasing the curveball at precisely the right
instant. And it is in the analytical left hemisphere of the brain, which
controls the right side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>, where these sorts of timing decisions are
best computed.

            It is a trite thought, I
know, but our hands and our faces come very close to being our selves--our
"higher" selves, at least (our lower ones reposing in some oafish organs in the
gut and below). The self that observes the world as a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cartesian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spectator</ENAMEX> lurks
directly behind the face, just above the eyes. The self that engages the world
as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Heideggerian homo Faber</ENAMEX> inhabits the hands, just above the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">palms</ENAMEX>.

            Both are subject to
alienating experiences. Staring at our face in the mirror, as <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Face</ENAMEX>
author points out, "we become first and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> at once, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewer</ENAMEX> and
viewed. Even when the face is utterly impassive, we can know what it's
thinking, I know what it's thinking , and enjoy a moment of mind
reading." (For some reason, this works best at the end of a cocktail party,
when you have ducked into the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bathroom</ENAMEX> and are feeling slightly squiffy.) Or,
wiggling your fingers by letting the motive force propagate directly from your
will to the digits, you suddenly notice the real cause of the action is quite
elsewhere, in tendons rippling beneath the skin way up at the elbow--a bit of
mechanical trumpery that gives the lie to the self. I would recommend these
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">metaphysical</ENAMEX> exercises as a cheap alternative to reading <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Face and</ENAMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hand</ENAMEX> .
