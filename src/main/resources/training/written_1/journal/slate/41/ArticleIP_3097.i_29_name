            The perpetual hair crisis is
never over. Hair produces <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> times the anxiety clothes ever stir up--nobody
admits to having a bad clothes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX>, for example. Fashion in coiffure naturally
relates to what's cool below the neck, but since we mostly grow our hair
ourselves, its visual life has a stronger meaning than that of pants and
shirts. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> I know, a distinguished <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> of philosophy at a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">distinguished university</ENAMEX>, has just had his short, light-brown hair dyed
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">platinum blond</ENAMEX>. What made him do that? He wanted, he told me--this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>'s career
is based on deep thinking and he lives in amorous harmony with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>--to look
like a gay weight lifter. So he does, sort of. His new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hair</ENAMEX> produces a fine
ambiguous effect, a not-so-easily-readable physical presence that can blend in
with several wayward forms of nonacademic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>. It also gives just the
slightest salutary fright to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>.

            Not
everybody pinpoints his own wishes as accurately as my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX>, but since the
death of compulsory hats, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> have allowed their personal fantasies
to focus on hair even more than on clothes. Clothes are public husks, they
shift on and off your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> and in and out of fashion and your life; you can
hide your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alternate selves</ENAMEX>, or your mistakes, in the back of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">closet</ENAMEX>. But
hair is only partially public. Since it stays with you continuously, even while
you're naked, your hair adorns your most intimate identity, just as your face
does, and only secondarily supports the roles you play in life. What you do
with it has to satisfy in both realms. Not so easy in our hyperconscious and
fractional modern world.

            The hard thing is that the comforting fantasy you realize
on your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> may seem like quite another thing to the world. You cut your hair
very short to feel young and free; your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> sees the look of a plucked
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">turkey</ENAMEX>. Your haircut imitates a movie <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">star</ENAMEX>'s; in it you resemble a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">schoolteacher</ENAMEX>. In fact, hair fantasy is mostly unconscious and so is the
response to it. Our personal failures count as such only if we feel that our
hidden hair agenda fails us. Most others don't notice anything.

            The
publicity of private hair is a long story; it figures in the willingly shaven
heads of ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priests</ENAMEX> and modern <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">skinheads</ENAMEX>, in the punitive shearing of male
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">convicts</ENAMEX> and female <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">collaborators</ENAMEX>, in huge powdered wigs and elaborately
extended curls or braids. Politically charged hair doubtless dates straight
back to humanity's first racial conflicts, perhaps preceded by its earliest
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">social</ENAMEX> conflicts. It's the hair of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enemy</ENAMEX> that marks him as such, as with
the flowing tresses of royalist <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cavaliers</ENAMEX> (effete <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">tyrants</ENAMEX>) and the cropped hair
of parliamentary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roundheads</ENAMEX> (crude <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">thugs</ENAMEX>) during the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">English Civil War</ENAMEX>.
Partisan passion about hair has been keenest in gender politics--expressed
mainly by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> cutting off their hair and by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> growing it--since hair is
universally erotic and has no function except as a vehicle of pleasure and
meaning. The idea that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> must wear differing coiffures goes very
deep, since visible hair is what should reveal the invisible difference between
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX>. This shows up in pictures of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Adam</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Eve</TIMEX> before the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Fall</ENAMEX>, where
his hair is always rather short and hers is always very long and noticeable, as
if God had personally styled them that way from the beginning.

            
For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">some years</TIMEX> now <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> have been wearing
disorderly hair as a rule--the more chic the messier. An insouciant, infantile
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">carelessness</ENAMEX> seems to be the desired effect, even if a well-tailored suit is
covering a well-tended body below the helter-skelter <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX>. This custom suggests
new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stages</ENAMEX> in the old rebellion against religious strictures, which once
demanded that female hair--divinely ordained to be long and seductive--be
covered up lest it incite lust. In the modern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West</ENAMEX>, progressive slackening of
those rules came to permit naked hair for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, but only under visible
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX>--not hidden, but very well-dressed in public. Even short hair was
eventually acceptable for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, too, but visibly careful grooming was still
the rule for fashionable female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heads</ENAMEX> until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last 15 years or so</TIMEX>.

            Since
then we've been having the mop and the shag and the mane and the haystack, with
straight and curled, long and short versions of each, sometimes untidily caught
up in clamps and clasps and elastic bands. Hair in historical movies is often
the same, never mind the elaborately coiled and oiled evidence of history. It
would seem that the more powerful modern <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> feel, the less they want their
hair to look submissive--and that includes neat. By contrast the complex
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX> of braids worn by many black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> seem like elegant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reincarnations</ENAMEX> of
ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Egyptian</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Minoan</ENAMEX> practice, a civilized display of effort made,
precise care taken, beauty <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manifestly</ENAMEX> pursued and achieved in the most august
tradition.

            This idea is even fashionably acceptable for the chic face
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> and for certain clothes, but not for modish hair. Heaven forbid that
the old tease-and-spray routines should appear habitual to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carolyn</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bessette-Kennedy</ENAMEX> or the supermodels. The look of money spent, yes--mops and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">haystacks</ENAMEX> do actually need a constant attention that braids don't; and
elaborate processes for streaking and tinting and correctly disarranging them
can rack up a very noticeable tab. But the overall impression must remain that
of no trouble taken whatsoever, even to make a straight part, so that the hair
looks as if sun and wind and some tumbling in bed were all it ever got.
Anything too processed might smack of oppression or repression, pretension or
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hypocrisy</ENAMEX>, maybe acknowledged alliance with reactionary values, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Margaret</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> effect. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Coiffed</ENAMEX> hair is desirable for TV anchorwomen and political
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX>, as a proper concession to masculine convention, but not when
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">off-duty</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Men</ENAMEX> have a
harder time with their hair. Censure for hairstyles has mostly fallen on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>,
since male appearance has forever mattered so much at war and work. Detailed
rules have much more often been applied to male rather than to female
arrangements. As a result <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> are much more afraid of looking ridiculous than
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> are, since female fashion has risk built into it. For <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>'s hair, the
cosmic risk is the possible baldness haunting them all, and that only adds to
the high tension attending male choices.

            
Modern <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> have been saddled with an image of
strong simplicity, the neat suggestion of an upper-class sporting and military
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">milieu</ENAMEX>. That <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ralph Laurenish</ENAMEX> note blends quite well with proletarian chic or
the skinhead aesthetic. The visual keynote is sharp clarity, so that the
overall norm is neat, short hair, give or take <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a few inches</NUMEX>. Long and flowing
is occasional, really messy is exceptional. But dreadlocks aside, modern
pared-down male looks, even daring ones, will not permit any deliberately
ornamental curling and braiding and powdering and adorning of hair. That mostly
leaves creative topiary, with shearing and partial shearing included, for the
fantasy life of male hair.

            Flagrant dyeing for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> is
also becoming more common, following female <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">practice</ENAMEX>--but not in the
mainstream, out of which my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">academic friend</ENAMEX> is so eager to keep. At an earlier
period, this same adventurous philosopher briefly affected the softly stubbled
face, and still earlier the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">quarter-inch-long</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">haircut</ENAMEX> then uncommon even at the
margins, except in military <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>. When he did that, I said, how could you?
why did you? wailing at the loss of his fine thatch and simultaneously unable
to keep from stroking his mown, velvety skull. "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Q.E.D.</ENAMEX>!" said he with
satisfaction. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Touché.</ENAMEX>
