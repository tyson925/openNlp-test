            On a steep and twisted
cobbled <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Provence</ENAMEX>, I recently saw a beautiful young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> with a heavy
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">baby</ENAMEX> in her arms. She was wearing a flattering skintight jumpsuit, swinging her
long hair, and easily hefting her precious burden, and she sauntered with total
feminine assurance along that stony, hilly little <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> in a pair of
platform-soled sandals with <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">skyscraper</ENAMEX>-high heels.

            She was a
breathtaking spectacle, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madonna</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Foolish Shoes</ENAMEX>. But it's also true that
had she been wearing, in the name of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Good Sense</ENAMEX>, elaborate running shoes--with
their ridiculous thickness and multiform brightness--they would have struck the
eye as equally attractive and equally absurd.

            It seems that feet are getting bigger all the time--shod
feet, that is. While upper proportions have shifted uneasily from big shoulders
and wayward hair to neater hair and narrower shoulders, there has been a steady
trend down below toward gigantic shoes for both sexes and all
ages--multicolored and padded feet, creatively laced-up, zipped-up, and
raised-up feet. The fashion press has called this part of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">'70s Revival</ENAMEX>, and
those who remember that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decade</TIMEX> may recall the platform footgear then current.
Back then, they suggested a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">'40s Revival</ENAMEX>, but this time something else is going
on.

            More than
one thing, perhaps. Shoe fetishism is certainly nothing new, though for women
it has been mostly a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">20 th</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-century</TIMEX> passion. Like so much else, sexy
shoes used to be a male privilege, from the aristocratic pointed
poulaines of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15 th century</TIMEX> that stretched out as far as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>
inches to the huge cavalier boots of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17 th century</TIMEX>, with their
high scarlet heels and great <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">butterfly</ENAMEX> shapes over the instep. During <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">most of</TIMEX>
that time, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>'s feet "like little <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> stole in and out" (as Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Suckling</ENAMEX> put it in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1641</TIMEX>) from under the hems of floor-length skirts. No wonder
modern <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> went overboard once their skirts rose off the ground and pants
became an option. Again and again, feminine fashion in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this century</TIMEX> has
exploited the powerful erotic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> of footgear, just when modern <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>'s
shoes had begun to retreat into simplicity along with the rest of the male
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">wardrobe</ENAMEX>.

            
The shoe story is much more complex <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>. We
want to mask our deep love of bondage and ferocity with the rhetoric of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">comfort</ENAMEX>, fitness, and athletic glory. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Men</ENAMEX> can play that game too, and anybody's
shoes can now combine madness and badness with gestures toward <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX>. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">flabby</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> on the bus wears wrinkled pants, shirt, and windbreaker in
nondescript shades of gray, but on his feet are enormous shoes sculpted out of
bulbous shapes in dazzling white and purple, <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Olympic</ENAMEX> echoes in a sedentary
life. The tiny black dress of a scrawny <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> at a party exposes thin whittled
legs ending in vast square-toed ankle boots just perfect for hiking over miles
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Himalayan glacier</ENAMEX> or surviving in the trenches during <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">I. Delicate</ENAMEX>
pumps would never set off her frame as well as these monsters do.

            The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">erotic</ENAMEX> charge comes from the shoes being crippling and enabling at the same
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>, the effect traditionally produced by very high heels. They lift the lady
up, seductively tighten her leg muscles, and thrust her forward as if to launch
her into the air and into her future, even as they shorten her stride and
increase her risk of tripping. High heels look elegant and dangerous, like
those endless pointed shoes on the medieval princes, but they are also
thrilling, like roller blades, figure skates, or toe shoes. They are fierce
engines of art, designed to demonstrate that an authoritative grace can
transcend all danger, inconvenience, and absurdity.

            All this is possible because feet themselves are so banally
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">utilitarian</ENAMEX> and infinitely sexy, with sensitive nerve endings and suggestive
shapes clothing the tough muscle and articulated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone</ENAMEX> that carry us around.
Feet can kick and stomp and trample, or receive and give refined <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">caresses</ENAMEX>; they
can make us dance like angels or march like brutes. But they're also acutely
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">helpless</ENAMEX>, with skin that's much too touchy and toes that aren't so clever. They
need help in a way hands don't. Like ears, feet are natural jewels that cry out
for visual emphasis. From my high window, I can see faraway <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> walking on
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Sixth Avenue</ENAMEX>, their little white sneakers giving a pearly edge to each
stride.

            The notorious <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> binding
of female feet emphasized their tenderness by reducing them to living
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sweetmeats</ENAMEX> wrapped in silk--the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">lily</ENAMEX> foot was meant to slide easily into a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lover</ENAMEX>'s mouth. We are now perversely disposed to do the same thing with clumpy
boots that box feet in or puffy shoes that muffle them up with blobs or
colorful wadding, to which delicious concoctions have been added--the weighty
clogs with dainty straps, the lofty heels with splayed bottoms. These are
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">endless</TIMEX> new treats for the shoe <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fetishist</ENAMEX> who seems to lurk in every modern
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">soul</ENAMEX>, by turns obsessed with rapid mobility and paralyzed victimhood, high
prowess and low violence.
