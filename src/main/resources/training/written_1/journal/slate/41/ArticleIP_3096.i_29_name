            I walked through <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manhattan</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Village</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the other day</TIMEX> to see what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> were wearing at the center of
bohemia <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these days</TIMEX>. I was immediately struck by the benign, pastel tonality of
the clothed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>; there seemed to be a large consensual flight from the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">color</ENAMEX> black, that famous hue of communal refusal. Instead, everybody was
offhandedly wearing an assortment of garments in pale colors, as if
deliberately refusing the high-impact, self-aware look that black gear now
gives to modern urban life. It seems that the bohemian spirit has gone beyond
the old war against palatable daylight hypocrisy waged in the costume of stark
dark truth. Once upon a time, colorful clothing was the sign of unspeakable
naiveté or ridiculous ostentation, to be shunned in favor of black by all
properly bemused and detached <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> of society. Now, it's clearly lost its
enemy status. With black so standard and so obvious, color--especially mild,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">muted</ENAMEX>, faded thrift-shop color--is no longer uncool.

            When I
was a bohemian college <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>, only black was acutely cool,
because it was so hard to find. Standard inexpensive clothes in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX>--sweaters and skirts, let's say--came in dark blue, dark green, and
maybe brown or maroon, the traditional colors of country sportswear favored by
the Ivy League, and in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tweedy</NUMEX> mixtures or pale versions of the same. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Socks,</ENAMEX>
too. All this was excruciatingly uncool, hopelessly demeaning. You could get a
black dress or black suit for lots of money, but that was only occasionally
permissible and mostly not possible; and there were no thrift <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> full of
interesting castoffs. Satisfactory rebel <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">black</ENAMEX> had to be tracked down in places
that specialized in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dancers</ENAMEX>' gear, for example (where you could find black
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tights</ENAMEX> and turtlenecks), or made at home during vacations. I remember
concocting many a funereal top and bottom and the occasional black cape on my
sympathetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>'s sewing machine. On a tight budget, it required real effort
to oppose the multicolored, tacky assumptions of ordinary life in those
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>.

            In high <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Victorian</ENAMEX> times, advanced feminine elegance was
defined by a range of brilliant hues, and non-fashionable clothing mostly by
dull black. Black was worn by mourners and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clergy</ENAMEX>, by civil and domestic
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">servants</ENAMEX>, and by the poor as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">best</TIMEX>. The old social hierarchies
disintegrated after <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War I</ENAMEX>, and boring non-fashion could become
revolutionary high fashion. Only then could <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chanel</ENAMEX> daringly use dull black
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">textiles</ENAMEX>, until then associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">widows</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">weeds</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">maids</ENAMEX>' uniforms, for
plain but costly little dresses that made the contrived, bright, or pallid garb
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">belle époque</ENAMEX> look foolish.

            
Fashionable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> discovered that simply cut garments in plain black fabric
were as flattering to them as <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</TIMEX> clothes were to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Women</ENAMEX>'s fashion
hasn't been the same since, and the feminine appeal of muted black clothes,
later extended to menswear for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, has kept its mainstream power. That power
was echoed in the rebellious bohemian version, which inevitably became a
sizable fashion market itself and took over a large part of expensive chic. For
that very reason, perhaps, current urban opposition to the whole
image-conscious mainstream is veering over to what used to look like farm
clothes: the faded green-and-yellow-checkered shirts and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">orange</ENAMEX>-washed-out-to-coral sweatshirts of poor and artless rural life.

            
It's hard to believe that bohemian black is
gone for good, because its prestige is so great. Suggesting, as it did, the
remote look of both the unworldly priesthood and the potent monastic orders,
black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">garb</ENAMEX> was often the anti-fashion choice of dandies and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intellectuals</ENAMEX>, of
Hamlet the anxious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prince</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Byron</ENAMEX> the smoldering <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poet</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baudelaire</ENAMEX> the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">austere</ENAMEX>, afflicted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critic</ENAMEX>. Black was also chosen by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> who took their cues
from those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>, by austere, anxious, or smoldering femmes fatales , such
as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Sand</ENAMEX>, who felt alone among their smugly blooming sex. Many intense,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">solitary</ENAMEX>, and impassioned heroines of fiction and history, wearing black
dresses in illustrative art, helped set the tone for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hosts</ENAMEX> of modern
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">temptresses</ENAMEX> in black. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Intelligent</ENAMEX>, unquiet black and sexy black have come
together in modern <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>'s fashion; a black dress feels both safe and
dangerous. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chanel</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> of poverty, was very clever to allow for the sense
of alienation in her chic black scheme.

            It was
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baldessare Castiglione</ENAMEX> (in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Book of the Courtier</ENAMEX> , finished <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1516</TIMEX>,
published <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1528</TIMEX>) who first recommended black costume as a means of conveying
personal distinction and a certain noble reticence. He offered this advice to
both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sexes</ENAMEX> at a time when elaborate clothes in rich colors were prevalent among
the mighty; and many of them took it. Much <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baroque</ENAMEX> portraiture
displays its successful effect, which has repeatedly inspired high and low
practical elegance ever since. Modern black sweaters and black leather jackets,
black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tuxedoes</ENAMEX> and all degrees of black <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">décolletage</ENAMEX> are ultimately descended
from those great examples, offered by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Titian, Velázquez</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rembrandt, et al.</ENAMEX>, of
the extra impact delivered by any human face that appears above a black-clad
body. Great photography, indebted to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rembrandt</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">successors</ENAMEX>, continues to
make the point.

            Now everybody can do it, and the fashion business has
apparently concluded that everybody will want to do it forever. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Designers</ENAMEX>'
attempts to eradicate the public's devotion to black clothes, whether by
self-styled bohemians in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SoHo</ENAMEX>, business and media <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> uptown, or wealthy
fashion folk around the globe, have succeeded only in fixing it more.
Transparent black and rugged black, fitted or flowing or bunchy black, black
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">velvet</ENAMEX> and satin, black spandex and plastic, never seem to go away. Striking
green, yellow, and purple may appear, and sober brown and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">navy</ENAMEX>, too, giving the
impression for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a few minutes</TIMEX> that modish black is over; but it never is--it's
just waiting.

            So far, that is. Given the
accumulated cultural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> of its myriad uses in history, you might predict
that the future of black clothing would be at least as long as its past. Since
modern black can be both high and low or right and left, it seems too versatile
to lose. But all that might fall away. Up to now, the black printed type on the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">page</ENAMEX> has also looked as indispensable as the adaptable dress of modern thought,
but we can't predict thought-fashion for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the coming centuries</TIMEX>. Maybe the
anti-fashion <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> now wearing pale blue and muted rose are dressing to match
the new dawn they assume will flood the future and ultimately wash away the
ink-stamped past.
