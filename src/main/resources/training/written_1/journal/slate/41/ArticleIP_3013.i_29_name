            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Updike</ENAMEX> is at bottom a
religious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">novelist</ENAMEX>, but when you try to identify what exactly his bottom-most
religious beliefs may be, the whole murky lot of them playfully slither
away--which gives his writing a touch of theological suspense. Typically, he
conjures a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lutheran</ENAMEX> or Presbyterian setting for his novels, and his enthusiasm
for those particular creeds induces him, at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">moments</TIMEX> of crisis in one plot after
another, to plunk his guilty male <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">culprit</ENAMEX> of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hero</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Updike</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heroes</ENAMEX> are almost
always guilty <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX>) down on a hardwood pew and to subject him to a vigorous
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> sermon on biblical themes.

            His new
novel, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Toward the End of Time</ENAMEX> , takes place in a futuristic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Massachusetts</ENAMEX>
in which nuclear war has leveled <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of civilization, strange new metallic
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> are threatening to gobble <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mankind</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> has collapsed, and a
gangsterish network of uniformed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">thugs</ENAMEX> called (chillingly) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">FedEx</ENAMEX> is
establishing a government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> of its own. Yet even in this most bizarre of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Updike</ENAMEX>'s novels, the guilty <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hero</ENAMEX> eventually finds himself sitting primly in a
pew, listening to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady minister</ENAMEX> declaim on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Magdalene</ENAMEX> and her womanly
tears. What do these <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> sermons amount to, though? Life is drab in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Updike</ENAMEX>'s
novels, and sins are vast, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> pieties that come tumbling down
from the pulpit never seem adequate to the case. And so <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Updike</ENAMEX>, in his fervor,
goes on a search for God (to thus label the object of his desires) directly, by
means of an intimate, unblinking examination of the world in front of his own
nose.

            He becomes a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">maniac</ENAMEX> of miniature observation. Atomic
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">particles</ENAMEX> dance in his eyesight. The world shimmers at him and, after a while,
encouraged by what he sees, he shimmers back, ecstatic. He is something very
close to a mystic in that respect--a transcendentalist in the old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New England</ENAMEX>
literary tradition, agog at the indescribable radiance of the lawn at his feet,
or at the white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brilliance</ENAMEX> of the refrigerator door, or at the ever-dazzling
dust motes floating through the sunbeams. He is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Emerson</ENAMEX>--except that, like a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lunatic</ENAMEX> in an asylum, he has spent a lifetime in the mistaken belief that he is
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hawthorne</ENAMEX>.

            
               Toward
the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">End of Time</ENAMEX> might seem different from his other novels because of the
sci-fi trappings, which do get rather fantastic. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Updike</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hero</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ben</ENAMEX>, a
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">66-year-old</TIMEX> retired financial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX>, is suddenly transposed across the ages
to ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX>, then to the time of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus</ENAMEX>, then to medieval <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ireland</ENAMEX>. He
begins an affair with a young call <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> who on some other <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> of existence
may be a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">deer</ENAMEX>, and then a new affair with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> so young as still to be a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>. Strange astronomical <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">weirdnesses</ENAMEX> roam across the post-nuclear sky. It's
all very puzzling, and the urgent hope that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Updike</ENAMEX> will explain these many
mysteries keeps you faithfully turning the pages.

            
Arguably he does offer an explanation, by means
of a theory about how time can branch off in different directions and perform
different <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX>, like a computer program. Alternatively, you could regard
some of those strange doings as the addled fantasies of the aging suburban
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hero</ENAMEX>, whose <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journal</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX>, filled with rants against his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> and
pornographic musings and notations about his deteriorating health, constitutes
the novel. But either way, once you get past the sci-fi extravaganzas,
Toward the End of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> tells a story exactly like that in any number of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Updike</ENAMEX>'s novels--of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> unhappy in marriage, blue with remorse, and unable to
figure out what to do, except by attending closely to the radiant surface of
the visible reality in front of him.

            And so <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Updike</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ben</ENAMEX> observes
the passage of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seasons</TIMEX>--life bursting into blossom in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early spring</TIMEX>, for
instance:

            There are suddenly
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> wild on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>, clogging the doorway to the convenience <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX>,
raucously scraping their skateboards and roller blades along the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sidewalks</ENAMEX>,
flaunting their pasty <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> skins in shorts and baggy untucked T-shirts. Where
have they been all <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX>, these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>? They are spontaneously, repulsively
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hatched</ENAMEX>, like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">flies</ENAMEX> that now buzz and bump on the inside of the kitchen
windows, drunk on warmth. Driving out to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Route 128</ENAMEX>, I see a weeping cherry
<ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>, no less spectacular for being familiar, making its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> splash of
purple-pink ... and even along the driveway my poor little spindly pear trees
have devised a few blossoms, at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of which I saw a sleepy bee bumbling, my
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">first bee</ENAMEX>. On <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Route 128</ENAMEX>, for no practical reason, there is a thickening of
traffic--another <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">spring</TIMEX> phenomenon, garaged <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> released.

            In <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Toward the End of Time these descriptions</ENAMEX> never
quite rise to ecstatic levels, though. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ben</ENAMEX> remembers how, as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>, the pulp
magazines <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Amazing and Astounding</ENAMEX> , with their "remote, radiant,
exploding facts," used to relieve the pressure of everyday bleakness for him.
But facts seem to have lost that power. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ben</ENAMEX>'s dutiful recording of miniscule
new shifts in foliage slips ever deeper into sadness. At the beginning of the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> he finds, or imagines, a tiny shred of second-rate love with his call
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">girl/deer</ENAMEX>, and later on finds, or imagines, an even tinier shred of a
preposterous less-than-love with his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girlfriend</ENAMEX>. But by the end, he
cannot imagine being loved by any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">human being</ENAMEX> at all and comforts himself with
the pathetic idea that perhaps the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fungus</ENAMEX> growing on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late-autumn</TIMEX> soggy
ground is offering him, in some spongy vegetable manner of its own, the
acceptance he craves. "At times, curled beneath its soft beige gills of thallic
matter, a kind of breath hints of love." And it becomes poignantly clear that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Updike</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hero</ENAMEX> is beginning to die, not just because his physical self is
deteriorating, but because he has a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soul</ENAMEX>, which is shrinking.

            It's not a great novel.
Updike scatters too many leafy sci-fi fantasies across his pages and never does
get around to raking them up again, which is disappointing. I don't entirely
believe those sci-fi notions, anyway. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cast</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> is a little thin.
But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Updike</ENAMEX>, even in this book, is a great <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX>, the greatest we have, in his
particular areas of strength--in the control of visual details, in his rhythmic
intensity, in the colors and shapes that come pouring syncopatedly from his
mischievous pen. I fear that too many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> will throw up their hands in
exasperation at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Updike</ENAMEX>'s way of appealing for love by presenting his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heroes</ENAMEX> as
ever more odious or cantankerous, and too many other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> will celebrate the
book mostly for its secondary virtues--its astronomical wonders sailing through
the futuristic sky, the human-chomping metal <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, a few political jokes.
But there is a primary virtue to this book, subtler than its other traits, and
this primary virtue is to be, ever so quietly, heartbreaking.
