            For a recent piece in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times Magazine</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lois Gould</ENAMEX> went to see the latest ready-to-wear
fashion collections--not as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX>, but as a guest. She then wrote about
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">runways</ENAMEX> together as a tout ensemble , accessorized by
camera <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crews</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX>, and others present. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">novelist</ENAMEX> and feminist,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gould</ENAMEX> has the stance of a resolute <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">outsider</ENAMEX>; her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> was a fashion <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">designer</ENAMEX>,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gould</ENAMEX> has built her identity on having none of it. She approaches the
undertaking in the spirit of satire--the serious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX>'s favored mode since
the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Middle Ages</TIMEX> for dealing with fashion--and, since fashion now has no
existence without its spin <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gould</ENAMEX> included them as part of her
target.

            She
quoted one of a group of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX>: "Can't we call it something--so it souds
new?" And another: "If I can stick to information, I won't have to say I hate
it." She overheard equivocal efforts to "call it something," so that " 'I like
the concept' usually meant ugly"; and that when "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miyake</ENAMEX> had baggy <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prison</ENAMEX> garb,
the word on that was 'intellectual' "; or that "if it looks like an old pinup
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rita Hayworth</ENAMEX> in a nightie, it's a return to femininity." And so the news
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">media</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gould</ENAMEX> marveled sardonically, "manage to explain it all." But while
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalists</ENAMEX> feel they must sneer at the "same old" <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> of the handsome
wearable designs, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> greet them with applause.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gould</ENAMEX> was discovering an unfortunate dilemma in the
profession of fashion journalism: Since <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> don't feel allowed to come
right out and say they "hate it"--a collection, an item--or to praise what is
really praiseworthy but not new enough, their writing tends to develop an
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">oblique</ENAMEX>, distorted character. It's often clear they hate something, if only the
horrid jostle and pressure of covering the shows; or, maybe, it's dislike of
their own contorted rhetoric that's rubbing off on what they say about the
clothes. It gives the phrases that "explain" the garments an over-the-top
quality that only adds absurdity to an art already taking big aesthetic risks.
("The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">master</ENAMEX> of clean, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Calvin Klein</ENAMEX> pairs thongs and a strapless dress with
symmetrical slashes in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">silver</ENAMEX>, lending an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Eastern</ENAMEX> flavor to his minimalist
ethic"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">-- Vogue</ENAMEX> .) Since this prose is often all the public gets, along
with a few minimally informative photos, the long-term effect is to keep
fashion looking much sillier than it actually is.

            The effect
is compounded by the steady pressure on the public consciousness of ad copy,
which consistently overpraises fashion goods and so debases their real
aesthetic value. Of course, hysterical praise has always been lavished on
finery by folk in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX> ("It looks terrific, it's fabulous, it's
YOU")--and not just in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this century</TIMEX>, but back through the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> previous ones. In
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fanny Burney</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Evelina</ENAMEX> , published in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1778</TIMEX>, there is an early scene at a
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> fabric <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop</ENAMEX>:

            
               I
thought I would never have chosen a silk, for they produced so many, I knew not
which to fix upon, and they recommended them all so strongly, that I fancy they
thought I only wanted persuasion to buy everything they showed me. And indeed
they took so much trouble, that I was almost ashamed I could not.
            

            At the accessory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop</ENAMEX>, the country <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> is surprised to be
served by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>:

            
               And such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>! so
finical, so affected! They seemed to understand every part of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>'s dress
better than we do ourselves: and they recommended caps and ribands with an air
of so much importance, that I wished to ask them how long they had left off
wearing them!
            

            Nothing the matter with
buying lovely new things; it's the invasive verbal hype that interferes with
personal judgment and turns the happy effort into an embarrassing burden.

            Credit for most good writing
about clothing during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the same three-century</TIMEX> period must go to the poets and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">novelists</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tolstoy</ENAMEX>'s rendering of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anna Karenina</ENAMEX>'s magic in her black ball gown,
or of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Princess</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Betsy</ENAMEX>'s d√©colletage at the theater, stand out as examples, along
with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry James</ENAMEX>' magnificent glancing allusions to the emotional power
generated by a rustle, a ribbon, the drawing on of a pair of gloves.

            Lately,
however, there is less and less of this in literature. Fashion <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalists</ENAMEX> and
sensational fictioneers like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Danielle Steele</ENAMEX> have co-opted the field, and other
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> are scared off. Fashion now seems like a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">club</ENAMEX> with a private jargon
that leaves no room for the play of sensitive literary exposition. And good
critical writing about clothing hardly exists at all. There is no tradition of
clothes criticism that includes serious analysis, or even of costume criticism
among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">theater</ENAMEX>, ballet, and opera <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX>, who do have an august writerly
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heritage</ENAMEX>. This fact may be what makes the fashion <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalist</ENAMEX> hate her job--the
painful sense that real work cannot be done in this genre, that it would be
better, more honorable, to be writing about something else.

            There are heartening exceptions. One is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amy Spindler</ENAMEX> of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> , who seems to take clothes seriously without excess or
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">apology</ENAMEX>, deploying a quick imagination and an interest in detail that give her
writing a fine attentive sting. (A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Versace</ENAMEX> show "opened with razor-sharp
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bias</ENAMEX>-cut asymmetrical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">navy</ENAMEX> dresses, stern except for a frill at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hem</ENAMEX> and a
swatch of black lace that masked eyes.") There was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kennedy Fraser</ENAMEX>, late of
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Yorker</ENAMEX> , whose witty essays on fashion published in that magazine
during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1970s</TIMEX> have since, happily, been collected. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Holly Brubach</ENAMEX>, who
succeeded <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fraser</ENAMEX> at The 
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Yorker</ENAMEX> , kept the standard high during
her time there. A big exception is the fashion journalism of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>, where a
noticeable respect for fashion has been a standard common attitude since the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17 th century</TIMEX>. Fashion is as acceptable in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> as any imaginative
work, and criticism about it has certainly flourished there. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Denis Diderot</ENAMEX> has
much to say about dress in the theater, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Honor√© de Balzac</ENAMEX> wrote an incisive
treatise on neckties, among his many essays on elegance. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St√©phane Mallarm√</ENAMEX>©
actually did a bit of fashion reporting in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1870s</TIMEX>, some under the name of
"<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mlle</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Satin</ENAMEX>." (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> good current <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critic</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laurence Bena√Øm</ENAMEX>, whose
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">thoughful</ENAMEX> pieces appear regularly in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Le Monde</ENAMEX> .)

            But
fashion has been without honor in the English-speaking world for so long that
we are afraid to take it seriously--solemnly, yes, as we take so many things,
but not with ordinary seriousness. When we are not in raptures, or disapproving
in the name of female realities, we are likely to wax sociological and
psychological about fashion, to weigh it down with quasiscientific meaning--out
of some ancient fear, perhaps, of its obvious debt to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eros</ENAMEX>.

            
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lois Gould</ENAMEX> was writing about ready-to-wear
fashion, which tends to be dealt with all the more hysterically (see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Robert</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Altman</ENAMEX>'s film <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pr√</ENAMEX>™t-a-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Porter</ENAMEX> ) for there being huge amounts of money at
stake in the success or failure of its collections. These clothes are designed
for large-scale factory production, and the chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer</ENAMEX> is a bulk <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">buyer</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Journalists</ENAMEX> feel responsible for protecting a serious financial investment each
season. Trying to summon and express good judgment may be next to
impossible--even good judgment about what will sell.

            And so we
still have the haute couture with its extreme apparitions twice <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX>,
an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enterprise</ENAMEX> frequently announced as dead but repeatedly revived as a
well-publicized modern game. Haute couture was invented in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1850s</TIMEX> to
serve private <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> privately. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">press</ENAMEX> was only grudgingly allowed into its
by-invitation-only showings <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly half</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a century</TIMEX> after famous <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">couturiers</ENAMEX> first began holding sway over the clothing of the world's
elegant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Reporters</ENAMEX> had to sneak into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ascot</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Longchamps</ENAMEX> or modish
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">restaurants</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">theaters</ENAMEX>, or crash chic garden <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> to see what was being
worn by whom. They could sketch or describe new fashions as accurately as their
spying talents permitted.

            In the present climate, it's the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">camerapersons</ENAMEX> who create the public event. The clothes seem aimed only at the
news <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX>, made only for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> who exist only to be transmuted into media
projections (verbal and pictorial), cooked up to be consumed by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> who
not only won't wear the clothes but will never see them being actually worn.
The prose and the images form the entire experience.

            The couture <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">client</ENAMEX> is, in
fact, still private. The show is only partly for the distant world served by
the camera and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commentator</ENAMEX>; the rest is for her and her like, seated in the
front row. For the private <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client</ENAMEX>, there are still masterpieces of rare
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">delicacy</ENAMEX> and breathtaking beauty or exquisitely simple practicality, all made
possible by the materials and hand-workmanship available to couture <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>, and
conceived by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designers</ENAMEX> modifying their ideas to suit each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">client</ENAMEX>'s taste and
figure. For the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX>, however, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">designer</ENAMEX> uses the same resources for
explosions of bizarre novelty or to indulge his wildest fantasies--not all of
them benign--about <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, clothes, and the world. Money is not the point here;
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prestige</ENAMEX> is. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Writers</ENAMEX> could find true scope for their interpretive talents if
they could gain true prestige from meeting the challenge.

            These elements of each
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">couture</ENAMEX> show--exquisite clothes for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">super-rich</ENAMEX>, unbelievable costumes for
the supermodels--together make up a vision of hope and glory, a kind of poetry
about the possible beauty of possible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oscar Wilde</ENAMEX>, another great writer
on fashion, said, "All art must be useless." <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Couture</ENAMEX> demands <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> who will
do its uselessness justice.
