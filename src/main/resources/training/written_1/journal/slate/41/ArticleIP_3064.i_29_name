            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past five years</TIMEX>, my
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> and I have taken to getting our nails done--filed, painted--<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every week</TIMEX>.
So, it seems, have many other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> we see in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">subway</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>. Is this an
improvement in personal grooming (a thesis communitarian <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">philosophers</ENAMEX> might
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">advance</ENAMEX>) or yet another imposition on busy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX> by the beauty industry
(as feminist <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pundits</ENAMEX> might argue)? Well, here's why I do it: Manicures look and
feel great, plus they're remarkably cheap and fast <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these days</TIMEX>--<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$7</NUMEX> plus tip, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> tops. You used to have to go to a beauty <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">salon</ENAMEX>, wait twice as long, and
pay twice as much. What happened? <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Entrepreneurial Korean</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Vietnamese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>,
putting ethnic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">credit unions</ENAMEX> to good use, opened discount nail salons in every
city neighborhood in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>.

            If the
goal of feminism is greater economic and social independence for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, then
storefront manicure <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parlors</ENAMEX> are a feminist success story for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1990s</TIMEX>: They've
turned a generation of new female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX> into small-business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX>. But
cosmetics and personal care have always been a way for marginalized <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> to
gain entry to the marketplace. That's one lesson of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hope</ENAMEX> in a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jar</ENAMEX> , a
history of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX> beauty culture from the late-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">th</ENAMEX> to the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-20 th century</TIMEX>, a period when the pursuit of improved looks was
transformed from a matter of folk recipes whispered from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> to a
multibillion dollar industry. In fact, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">historian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kathy Peiss</ENAMEX> writes, "the
beauty industry may be the only business, at least until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent decades</TIMEX>, in
which <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> achieved the highest levels of success, wealth, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">authority</ENAMEX>."

            For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past three decades</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">feminists</ENAMEX> have been accusing
the beauty industry of fiendishly sophisticated campaigns to undercut women's
self-worth. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A century ago</TIMEX>, no one could have imagined that beauty could be
anything as faceless as an industry, let alone one capable of a broad social
agenda. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 19 th century</TIMEX>, beauty, connoting as it did
individual service and the laying on of hands, was considered a trade too
vulgar for respectable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. It was a low-class, penny ante affair, therefore
an excellent opportunity for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX>. There were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">field</ENAMEX>, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> had the edge. They could claim to use the products themselves
and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> trusted them. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> who rose to the top invented flamboyant
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">personas</ENAMEX> to go with their step-by-step systems, but they came from distinctly
unglamorous backgrounds.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Helena</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rubenstein</ENAMEX> was a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Polish Jew</ENAMEX> who embarked on a career as a cold- and
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vanishing-cream</ENAMEX> saleswoman only after her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> interrupted her medical
education to ship her out of reach of an unsuitable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boyfriend</ENAMEX>. But she claimed
to descend from aristocracy and to have advanced scientific degrees. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elizabeth</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arden</ENAMEX> was born <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Florence Nightingale Graham</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tenant</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Madame</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C.J. Walker</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Annie Turnbo Malone</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of the best-known
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">entrepreneurs</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African-American</ENAMEX> history, were both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughters</ENAMEX> of slaves,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">orphaned</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, who began as purveyors of black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>'s hair potions.
Both defused charges of pandering to the straight-hair, white ideal of beauty
by becoming prominent "<ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">race</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>"--hiring only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> (usually <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>), giving
generously to black causes, and refusing to sell skin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bleach</ENAMEX>, a popular item
among <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African-Americans</ENAMEX>.

            
The early female cosmetics <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tycoons</ENAMEX> faced two
problems. One was the lingering Victorian belief that face painting was for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hussies</ENAMEX>. The solution was to tie makeup to the freedoms <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> were beginning to
enjoy: The "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">New Woman</ENAMEX>" who worked in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> or went to college or just
thought of herself as modern needed and deserved a new face for the world, just
as she needed and deserved the right to work and vote.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Women</ENAMEX>
eagerly embraced the idea that changing their faces would change their social
status. The new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> of beauty products wrote to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturers</ENAMEX> that they
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">applied rouge</ENAMEX>, lipstick, and mascara for their own pleasure, not that of their
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Men</ENAMEX> were more likely to oppose makeup than demand it, and often forbade
their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wives</ENAMEX> and girlfriends to use it.

            The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> problem was access to capital and to store
shelves. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Bankers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">distributors</ENAMEX> were generally loath to do business with the
gentler sex. The cosmetics queens solved this problem by exploiting their
intimacy with their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX>. During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first quarter of the century</TIMEX>, the
beauty industry advanced new sales techniques emphasizing personal contact:
door-to-door and mail-order marketing, beauty <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> and correspondence
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">courses</ENAMEX>, lines of cosmetics tied to salons. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malone</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walker</ENAMEX> were particularly
adept at what is known <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> as "multilevel marketing": They traveled around
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> recruiting black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> as sales <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX>.

            The rise
of mass production, national advertising, and brand identity--the mainstays of
consumer capitalism--sent most small beauty <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturers</ENAMEX> out of business, and
the rest into the hands of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> who directed large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporations</ENAMEX>. (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rubinstein</ENAMEX>
sold out to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lehman Brothers</ENAMEX>. Later, enraged by their downscale positioning of
her upscale products, she bought her <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> back.) But female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founders</ENAMEX> were
kept on as spokeswomen, or new front <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> were hired. Advertising <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>
hired their <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> to write beauty copy, then promoted them to higher
positions. Beauty <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazines</ENAMEX>, with scores of editorial jobs for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, emerged
out of what had been farm or dress-pattern <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publications</ENAMEX>. And some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, such
as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Estee Lauder</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Kay Ash</ENAMEX>, made the strategic alliances with male
financiers required to keep them afloat.

            
For <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX>, the key development of the 1920s
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">'30s</ENAMEX> was the mass-produced image, which led to the culture of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">celebrity</ENAMEX> and
unified standards of feminine beauty. Suddenly, there was a look, and everyone
had to have it. Whereas once beauty practices had had an appealingly informal
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen</ENAMEX> quality, now skin care and makeup <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regimens</ENAMEX> were codified--even taught
in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Women</ENAMEX> went from being active to passive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> in
the rites of beautification. No longer was putting on one's face seen as a
matter of individuality, dignity, or even racial advancement (moving to
Northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Great Migration</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1930s</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">'40s</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">'50s</ENAMEX>, many
former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sharecroppers</ENAMEX> saw applying cosmetics as a step toward participating in
the wider <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> culture). Making up became an mandatory act of conformity
and, by the time the women's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">movement</ENAMEX> began to address it, of oppression.

            This is the resentful
perception so many mainstream <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">feminists</ENAMEX> seem stuck in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Susan Faludi</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Naomi Wolf</ENAMEX>, for instance, talk about the beauty industry, they sound like
suspicious middle-class <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ladies</ENAMEX> eyeing a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chanel</ENAMEX> counter at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saks</ENAMEX>--they'll resist
those foreign wiles! But as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peiss</ENAMEX>' excellent research demonstrates, the culture
of beauty isn't all big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporations</ENAMEX> and victimized <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX>. Even during the
1950s, the height of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conformism</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> consistently ranked advice from
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sisters</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> as more likely to drive their buying decisions
than advertising. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nowadays</ENAMEX>, lefty female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">academics</ENAMEX> dress as "white trash" as a
statement of class protest. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lipstick lesbians</ENAMEX> wear heavier makeup than straight
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. Black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX> braid their hair to display their ethnic pride. In
other words, using makeup is as complicated an act as it has ever been.
