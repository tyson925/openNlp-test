            Now that
we have dismissed corsets as ridiculous instruments of torture, we can safely
entertain a vogue for flesh-piercing jewelry. As the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> said, "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Il</ENAMEX> faut
souffrir pour Ãªtre belle." In other words, to look as though you have willingly
undergone a bodily ordeal gives incalculable force to your erotic attractions.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tattooing</ENAMEX> and piercing are among the most ancient of such practices; piercing,
as recently revived, is among the most violent.

            Tender nipples stuck through with gold rings, sensitive
tongues punched through with barbells that make a noise against the teeth,
penises pierced for rings that go fore-and-aft or sideways, rings for the
clitoral hood and labia both inner and outer--all these have been common
additions to the chic ensemble since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about 1992</TIMEX>, hidden away behind clothing or
lips. But more and more nostrils and eyebrows are joining earlobes as handy
flaps to carry holes for an array of public adornments. The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">other day</TIMEX>, I felt
obscurely pained to see a pretty <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">subway</ENAMEX> with a big <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">silver</ENAMEX> ring in
the middle of her face, hanging from a hole in the central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partition</ENAMEX> of her
nose. The effect was notably different from the off-center charm of a gleaming
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stud</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> nostril or a row of thin rings edging the flange of an ear. Those
things all seem part of fashion's usual piquancy. This wasn't. Somehow this
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX>'s massive bangle made her genial face seem masked, slightly--but
distinctly--dehumanized.

            Bodily <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ornament</ENAMEX> originally was undertaken to create the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">self</ENAMEX>, to deck the outward being with the inward knowledge that trouble must be
taken and nature distorted in careful ways and at personal cost, so as to make
forever clear the gulf between a responsible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult</ENAMEX> and an infant or a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">beast</ENAMEX>.
Dramatic arrangements for doing this are famous--the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX>-flattening, the
neck-lengthening, the tooth-filing, the lip-stretching--all the irreversible
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ways</ENAMEX> of completing the human body that were called "barbaric" by restless
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> bent on scientific understanding, political and intellectual
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">enlightenment</ENAMEX>, or plain old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX>, holy and profane.

            It was
those restless <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who eventually invented fashion around the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13 th century</TIMEX>, their fabrications marking the body not with received
wisdom but with doubt. The modern <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> self was created on the theme of
perpetual subversion--that nothing was absolute, that the truth could be
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">obscured</ENAMEX> and rediscovered, that all advance could be reversed and recommenced,
that any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX>, including God's, could collapse and reform. And that effort
should be made, and money spent, to keep this idea in plain sight on the
surface of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>.

            
What really lasts are sex and death, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Woody</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allen</ENAMEX> once reminded everybody, and fashion endures because of those. Fashion
was born to stand for both unslaked personal desire and unappeased personal
dread; it reflects our modern devotion to the fragile trajectory of an
individual life. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> thing it must never do is look safe. Outrageousness
has always been provided by the young, but hitherto most commonly with hair.
Hair seems suited for nothing else: Its variable thickness of growth has
apparently no reference to climate, and its practical value seems to be its
malleability for purposes of erotic appeal. Hair revolutions are no longer as
outrageous as they have been in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent decades</TIMEX>, though; nor are skimpy
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">garments</ENAMEX>. So we have turned to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX> that make holes in faces and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX>--unique or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> or intimate, ferociously unnatural,
undeniably captivating, and faintly horrifying.

            A big
central nose ring goes beyond outrage. It comes from somewhere else, from the
non-fashion universe of eternal certainties and unbreakable <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cycles</ENAMEX>, where
bodily sculpture is applied with finality to signal a fixed social and sexual
identity. During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past seven centuries</TIMEX> of Western modernity, the most
extreme bodily modishness always was reversible. Shaved hair could grow back,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pinched</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">waists</ENAMEX> fill out, flattened breasts swell up. But a great big hole
through the septum does not close up without leaving a disfiguring scar.

            Western fashion has always included earlobe piercing for
both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sexes</ENAMEX>, a small talismanic reminder of what has been called the "folk
order." But earlobe tissue heals very easily, and mainstream male fashion
abandoned earrings <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early in the 17 th century</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare</ENAMEX> wore them,
but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jonathan Swift</ENAMEX> did not; even the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marquis de Sade</ENAMEX> did not. Much later,
during the progressive <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">first quarter of this century</TIMEX>, pierced ears for women
became utterly unfashionable, a sign of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Victorian</ENAMEX> bondage as abhorrent as
whalebone corsets and the double marital bed. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Almost two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX> of
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20 th -century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> lived with unpierced or healed earlobes, until
ear piercing became almost universal for both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s</TIMEX>, just
as if it had always been there.

            Maybe it was a prophecy.
Perhaps the era of fashion is over, or soon to be. These holes now mark a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> of which the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> cannot confidently say, "They'll grow out of
it." Tight <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">corsets</ENAMEX> never really hurt anybody--the fainting and the displaced
organs are long-exploded myths--but fatal infection is a serious current
horror. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Punches</ENAMEX> and needles carry a lethal threat; an injury that rips the
flesh is real injury. The pierced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> may simply be acknowledging the
deadliness of the times we live in, suggestive as they are of earlier epochs in
human history. Perhaps, like the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">subway</ENAMEX>, they're just waiting to be
led by the nose.
