            Everybody knows that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX>
is the realm of fashion, fashion is the realm of artifice, and both are the
realm of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">This year</TIMEX> as always, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> fashion has meant fabulous-looking
girls slinking along in <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">foot-high</NUMEX> hair or plastered-flat <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hair</ENAMEX> with grim or
giddy hats and stark painted faces, sporting fitted tops, transparent tops,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cutout</ENAMEX> tops, tight skirts slit to here, full skirts trailing to there, floppy
pants or skinny pants, trimmings that glitter or flutter, colors that dazzle or
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">puzzle</ENAMEX>, curled feathers and dyed fur, boiled <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wool</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">frosted leather</ENAMEX>, crushed
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">velvet</ENAMEX>, shot silk, frayed hemp, and distressed plastic. Such displays are to be
expected in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX>, as part of the traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> insistence that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eve</ENAMEX> has
the right to cut and shape her fig leaf, edge it with spangled lace, and
lacquer it black. If you want <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adam</ENAMEX>'s fig leaf in its natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">material</ENAMEX>, go to
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX>.

            Or so legend has it.
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> understatement set the universal standard for male elegance in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1800</TIMEX>,
and it's holding its own <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two centuries later</TIMEX>. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beau Brummell</ENAMEX> said, "If you
noticed me, I wasn't well-dressed," he put an end to purple feathers and
crimson velvet for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> all over the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Western</ENAMEX> world, and that was that, right
down to all the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Similar Sober Suits</ENAMEX> at summit meetings.

            But
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>, apparently, are getting tired of being inconspicuous. With no loss of
beauty and status (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>'s suits are just as becoming as they ever were), perfect
male tailoring has lost some of its virile edge. No wonder, since the strongest
theme in modern <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>'s fashion has been the creative theft of the male
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">wardrobe</ENAMEX>, with all its components translated into terms of conspicuous
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">seduction</ENAMEX>. How can men's fashion respond to this?

            <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> has the answer: Just take it back, and take it
further. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>--and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Milan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>, always hoping to outdo <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX>--is
offering <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>'s fashion shows of unexpected glamour, color, and sexuality,
founding a new theater that could someday rival its feminine equivalent,
applying <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eve</ENAMEX>'s method to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adam</ENAMEX>. In the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX>'s fall collections, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designers</ENAMEX>
for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> were using the same trousers and shorts, shirts and sweaters, coats and
jackets that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> had already rescued from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> decorum and boldly
distorted for themselves. The menswear shows deployed a similar
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">suggestiveness</ENAMEX>--a form-fitting shape, a brazen inventiveness of texture and
hue, a daring sweep of cuff, collar, and coattail, all totally forbidden by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saville Row</ENAMEX>, but gloriously worked up for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last 30 years</TIMEX> by the
likes of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yves Saint Laurent</ENAMEX>.

            Here
there's a fur scarf or some extra drapery added to the neck of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>'s suit;
there there's a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>'s raincoat in metallic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fabric</ENAMEX> that moves in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a million</NUMEX>
glittering folds. There's a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>'s svelte blazer tailored in a red-flowered
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ivory</ENAMEX> brocade. There are also references to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">17 th</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pirates</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabian</ENAMEX> 
               <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Nights sultans</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Regency</ENAMEX> bucks, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">fin-de</ENAMEX>-si√®cle
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dandies</ENAMEX> and depraved <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">noblemen</ENAMEX> of the ancien r(gime .

            
               I >t's
exhilarating to see this stuff back on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>, and not just in the movies. The
models look magnificent, especially the ones working for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vivienne Westwood</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jean-Paul Gaultier</ENAMEX>, who have joyfully reveled in creating extreme artifice for
both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sexes</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gaultier</ENAMEX>'s male <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> wear full makeup and pencil mustaches with
their finery, and they smolder with conviction. The ones from Masaki Matsushima
even smolder in silvery <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">18 th</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-century</TIMEX> wigs, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Moschino</ENAMEX> model
wore a blue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Louis XV</ENAMEX> wig with a blue denim ensemble, his face a charming study
in irony. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yohji Yamamoto</ENAMEX> uses tragic-faced models, some bald, middle-aged, and
not so slim, on whom his quasi-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Middle Eastern</ENAMEX> robes, coats, and headgear look
nearly noble. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">comely youths</ENAMEX>, on the other hand, look much like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shelley</ENAMEX>'s
portrait, with flowing locks and tender throats exposed above their soft suede
suits.

            The
whole display vividly depicts what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> have envied for so long. For
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX>, they had to look tough, modest, honest, and restrained under plain
suits or plain sportswear. Masculinity was allowed no erotic range in dress;
the phallic necktie, licensed to reflect light and glow with color, was
famously <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>'s only hope. Every expressive shape or shiny streak in a coat and
suit bore the dread suggestion of effeminacy, connoting both a lack of
integrity and an unbridled vanity felt to be unavoidable in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, but
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">criminal</ENAMEX>, even thuggish, in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>. And so the free play of fantasy died out of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>'s clothes. Revived fantasy has tended in one direction only, which means
that lately, there's been more than enough black leather, harsh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">metal</ENAMEX>, and
shaved hair. Maybe now that sexual ambiguity is recognized as a potent force,
we can begin to see <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> in gold embroidery and sweeping folds of silk.

            Long habits die hard, though. Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>'s fashion shows
still concentrate on exquisite variations of the formal and sporty classics,
with plenty of subtle colors, beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cravats</ENAMEX> and very discreet historical
references. Male <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> still can't carry off the gaudy stuff. They lurch
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">uncomfortably</ENAMEX> along the catwalk, imprisoned in a tradition of artlessness.
Skirts show no sign of appearing on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>, although Gaultier
has been promoting them for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>. His most recent catwalk version was a sari
wrapped around the waist under a jacket, falling to the instep and swinging
with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wearer</ENAMEX>'s manly stride. Very nice, but not likely to catch on until men
finally remember the comfortable tunics of the very distant past.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Men</ENAMEX> have already recovered
the masculine long hair, jewelry, and purses of medieval times. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skirts</ENAMEX> may
appear <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">some day</TIMEX> (that's a prediction) but probably with a military flavor, the
kind built into the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Scottish</ENAMEX> kilt or the battle dress of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX>.
Meanwhile, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lovers</ENAMEX> of spectacle will have to content themselves with drag, which
gives intermittent delight to its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">watchers</ENAMEX> and wearers, even if so far, it
hasn't made an appearance at summit meetings.
