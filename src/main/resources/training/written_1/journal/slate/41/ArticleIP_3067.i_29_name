            <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Economist Juliet Schor</ENAMEX> is
among a handful of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">academics</ENAMEX> to have achieved the widely held and rarely
admitted to dream of the professoriate: reaching a popular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> with work
that also passes muster technically. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Success</ENAMEX> as a pop academic requires
operating on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> levels--that is, making distinctly different arguments for pop
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> and academic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schor</ENAMEX>'s pop argument is: We spend too much on
stuff we don't need. Her academic argument is: For complicated sociological
reasons (which I'll explain in a minute), <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> spending patterns have
changed in ways we need to take notice of.

            Usually
in the pop-academic genre, the pop side will be interesting and the academic
side dutiful and obscure. In the case of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Overspent American</ENAMEX> , the
reverse is the case.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Intellectuals</ENAMEX> have never warmed to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> consumer
culture. Bashing it is a tradition that begins with the advent of a national
consumer market in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early decades</TIMEX> of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20 th century</TIMEX> (reread
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Babbitt</ENAMEX> if you don't believe me). The idea that a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> founded upon
high-flown principles has come to care more about fame, money, and accumulating
stuff than about the principles has long been galling to those who hold the
principles dear. So when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schor scoldingly</ENAMEX> writes, for example, "In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX> alone,
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> spent <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$7.6 billion</NUMEX> on residential lawn care, much of it
environmentally destructive," it doesn't feel like a fresh thought. Even if you
accept that <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">lawns</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> and credit card debt and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designer</ENAMEX> logos are
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pernicious</ENAMEX>, to attack them seems, as a writing project, a little easy. The main
point of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schor</ENAMEX>'s previous book, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Overworked American</ENAMEX> (which can be
adduced from the title), was less familiar than her main point here.

            But
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schor</ENAMEX>'s sociological theory is fascinating. It involves a change in most
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX>' reference <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. A reference <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> (the term was invented in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1942</TIMEX>
by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">psychologist</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herbert Hyman</ENAMEX>) is the set of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with whom you
compare yourself in order to appraise how you're doing. Your level of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">aspiration</ENAMEX> and contentment varies not according to some absolute standard but
according to your choice of reference <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. Change your reference <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, and
you'll find that you're suddenly feeling much better (or worse) about your
situation.

            
The reference <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> is one of the most widely
used concepts in social science and also in market research. The first person
to apply it to the field of consumer spending was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Duesenberry</ENAMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX>, who wrote a book in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1949</TIMEX> arguing that for most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reference</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> is made up of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX>. Hence "keeping up with the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joneses</ENAMEX>"--we buy whatever it takes to have what our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> have.

            Schor
believes that for most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> have been replaced as the primary
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reference</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> by a much broader and better-off panoply of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">co-workers</ENAMEX>,
acquaintances, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> presented by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX>. Prime-time television is
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">full</TIMEX> of supposedly ordinary, typical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> who live in fancier circumstances
than anyone at the median income could afford. The entry of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> into the
work <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> has exposed them to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> across a much wider income range than
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">obtains</ENAMEX> in the neighborhood. In a survey <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schor</ENAMEX> conducted at a big corporation
(sounds as if it is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southwestern Bell</ENAMEX>, although in keeping with academic
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">convention</ENAMEX>, she doesn't give its real name), <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 2 percent</NUMEX> of the people
responding said <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> were their primary reference <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>.

            Switching reference <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> has pushed <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>' spending
habits hugely upward. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schor</ENAMEX> has come up with the slightly wacky statistic that
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">each hour</TIMEX> of television a person watches per week will generate <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$208</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> in
spending. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Between 1979 and 1995</TIMEX>, she says, the average <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>'s spending,
adjusted for inflation, increased <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">between 30 percent and 70 percent</NUMEX>.

            The idea
that the reference-group calculations that underlie consumption habits have
changed makes sense. If this is a problem, then what do we do about it? <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schor</ENAMEX>'s
theory leads inescapably to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> answer: Find another reference <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> for the
average <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumer</ENAMEX>.

            
So far so good. But then we come to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reference</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schor</ENAMEX> proposes as an alternative. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schor</ENAMEX> calls them
"downshifters," <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who have scaled back the desperate work-and-spend cycle
and are much happier as a result. She claims, somewhat implausibly, that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX>
percent of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>, not counting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">retirees</ENAMEX>, voluntarily downshifted between
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990 and 1996</TIMEX>. In the chapter she devotes to anecdotal portraiture of
downshifters, though, they don't come across as being very appealing. One was
laid off. Another is living on unemployment insurance. Another "found herself
perilously close to the rock bottom." Another is "trusting that, somehow, it is
going to work." Is this the reference <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> that launched <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a thousand</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX>?

            Schor
celebrates downshifters--<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> defined by not spending--because she views
consumerism as evil. To her way of thinking no nonessential spending, no desire
to possess things, can ever be innocent or morally neutral. Instead, all taste,
all aesthetic judgment, all pleasure taken in things, must be a matter of what
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> call "positionality." It is merely a way of signaling status, even
if we've deluded ourselves into thinking it's not. There isn't much <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schor</ENAMEX>'s schema for even the interesting curlicues of spending culture, such as
the joy in finding a bargain or personal variances in taste (e.g., "uptown" vs.
"downtown")--let alone the idea that a possession could bring its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">buyer</ENAMEX> simple
pleasure. If, to use <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schor's</ENAMEX> examples, you don't want to put aluminum
siding on your <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> or garb yourself in polyester, the only possible reason is
that you don't want <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to think you're a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bubba</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schor</ENAMEX>'s right--it is depressing when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> get into the
grip of an all-engulfing need to establish their identity by buying stuff,
especially if it's stuff they can't afford. It is also the case that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazines</ENAMEX>, radio, and television are so financially dependent on
consumer advertising that they're unlikely to lead the charge against this
problem.

            Still, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">solution Schor</ENAMEX> proposes seems almost as forced and obsessive as overspending
itself. Why can't buying things be a pleasurable sideshow to the main events of
life? Why does it have to screw everything else up?

            
Let me propose another reference <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">culturati</ENAMEX> might glorify in the (perhaps vain) hope of curbing spending-mania:
happily functioning <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. Membership in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> would be defined in a
possession-neutral way. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> would belong by virtue of doing something she
loved and believed in, and by being enmeshed in a web of community, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>. A self-appraisal (and remember, the entire purpose of a reference
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> is to serve as a yardstick for self-appraisal) would entail evaluating
the richness of relationships and the satisfactions of accomplishments, rather
than the cataloging of possessions. Buying a new tie would be fun, not an
obsessive, central, tail-wagging-the-dog-of-life activity. If you can afford
it, great. If not, no big deal.

            It would also have been nice
to see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schor</ENAMEX> wrestle with the contradiction between her point and the Keynesian
tradition of treating higher incomes and more spending as the royal road to the
good society. Ever since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1930s</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">liberal economists</ENAMEX> have celebrated
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">consumerism</ENAMEX>--not because they find it culturally attractive, but because it
offers the promise of marrying the cherished liberal goal of income
redistribution to overall economic prosperity. Put money in ordinary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>'s
pockets, and as they spend it the assembly lines will hum and unemployment will
fall.

            This is the economic school
to which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schor</ENAMEX> belongs. She has a brief epilogue in which she admits that her
anti-consumerism conflicts with it but does it in a way that demonstrates that
she hasn't resolved the problem. "I have always believed there is great merit
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Keynesian</ENAMEX> view," she says stiffly, and then goes on to admit that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">downshifting</ENAMEX> might cause a slowdown in productivity growth--which, from an
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX>'s point of view, is pretty close to the ultimate horror. A great book
on her subject, rather than a good one, might have found a way to propose an
economic ideal that would not lead as inexorably into a social nightmare as
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schor's</ENAMEX> seems to.
