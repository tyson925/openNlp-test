antitrust lawsuit in a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 23</TIMEX> cover story. His (much-repeated and now familiar)
argument: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>'s "open standards" have created a prosperous, competitive
industry worth <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$40 billion</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> has no place deciding

The cover editorial and story tell <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Europeans</ENAMEX> to stop fretting about
genetically engineered <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">crops</ENAMEX>. Extremely popular in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, such
<ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crops</ENAMEX> are largely unwelcome in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. The efficient, bug-resistant plants
contain few, and mostly simple, genetic alterations: They are not terrifying
Frankenplants that will rage out of control. ... <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX>'s young are

            The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">magazine</ENAMEX> publishes the results of its investigation of former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Associate Editor</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Glass</ENAMEX>. Of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glass</ENAMEX>' <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41</NUMEX> TNR stories, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> contained fabrications, including
several that were entirely fabricated. Among the invented <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX>: "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel</ENAMEX>, a young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> at an <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Illinois</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">college</ENAMEX>"; the "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Cops</ENAMEX>

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walker Christ</ENAMEX>." ... The long cover story argues that only
gender-blindness will save us from the morass of sex harassment law. "Gender
essentialists," notably <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Catherine MacKinnon</ENAMEX>, have turned workplaces into
battlegrounds by insisting that almost any sexual interaction between a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> and
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> is coercive. This must stop. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> also proposes limiting employer
liability for sex harassment: To prevent lawsuits, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> have adopted
sexual policing policies that strip <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> of privacy and stultify <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>.
These policies would be unnecessary if sex harassers, rather than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>,
were sued.

            The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> slowdown arrives.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> 's cover story warns that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> know more about sex than their
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents suspect</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek</ENAMEX> 's says the aging of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby boomers</ENAMEX> has prompted
a surge in research about memory. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conclusion</ENAMEX>: Your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> know everything you

learning technical details about sex from television (notably <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dawson</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Creek</ENAMEX> ). Problem: <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Kids</ENAMEX> don't know enough about sex's moral dimension,
largely because <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> aren't imparting the sex education they should. A

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTV</ENAMEX>'s popular <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Loveline</ENAMEX> . (Another sidebar interviews <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> 12-year-old
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> about sex. They undermine the premise of the cover story by being
charmingly naive: "The frenching thing is the edge.") ...

               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek</ENAMEX> 's package on how memory works says that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX>, high blood
pressure, and too little sleep can damage recall. Physical activity, mental
exercises, and estrogen (for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>) can protect it. More and better therapies
are coming. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek</ENAMEX> is agnostic about supposedly memory-enhancing
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vitamin</ENAMEX> and herbal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">supplements</ENAMEX> such as ginkgo, saying the medical evidence
isn't in yet.
