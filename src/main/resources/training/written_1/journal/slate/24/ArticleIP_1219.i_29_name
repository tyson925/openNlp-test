<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. News</ENAMEX> , the cover editorial applauds <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HMOs</ENAMEX> for reducing medical
inflation. Suggestion for improvement: unregulated competition, which would
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">force HMOs</ENAMEX> to compete over quality as well as price. ... A story deplores the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>'s plans to control
encryption software on the Internet. Federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> want the right to read
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">encrypted</ENAMEX> messages, much as they currently have the right to tap phones. A free
market for encryption is a better idea: It would produce more reliable

            Yet
another special issue. The subject is--we're not kidding--business
travel as a way of life. Sixteen features look at the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">nomadic</ENAMEX> ennui of the

            An
absolutely terrifying article describes the old <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> bioweapons program and
speculates that rogue <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nations</ENAMEX> are now employing its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX>. Chilling
descriptions of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bioweapons</ENAMEX> abound: "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Veepox</ENAMEX>," a cross between <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">smallpox</ENAMEX> and a

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ebola</ENAMEX> and as contagious as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">smallpox</ENAMEX>. The bioweapons could be deployed quickly,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">surreptitiously</ENAMEX>, and cheaply; and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> is totally unprepared to deal with
them. (The article is by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hot Zone</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Preston</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">master</ENAMEX> of

Shifting, fluid acquaintanceships have replaced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX>, lifelong loyalties.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary Clinton</ENAMEX> is no longer a feminist icon: She's now "the very model of the
