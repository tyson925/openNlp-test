            The
cover editorial welcomes the resignation of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prime</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ryutaro Hashimoto</ENAMEX> but frets that his departure will hurt the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japanese</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">economy</ENAMEX>. Hashimoto deserved to go because he failed to reform the banking
system or to stop <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>'s financial descent, but it will take time to choose a
new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prime minister</ENAMEX> and even more time for the new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> to push through
reforms. ... An article notes an unpublicized cost of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Motors</ENAMEX>
strike: It is delaying the launch of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX>'s new sport utility <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicle</ENAMEX>, the
GMT800. The new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SUV</ENAMEX> is expected to be wildly profitable, but a delayed launch
will let <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">competitors</ENAMEX> get a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> start. ... A story says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">companies</ENAMEX>
now eschew insurance, favoring predictive models that help manage risk.
Sometimes, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> can foresee insurance will be unnecessary: While an
earthquake in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> snapped many telephone poles, the phone <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> made
back its losses as "worried <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> started calling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX>"--long
distance.

            The cover
story profiles <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Rubin</ENAMEX>, whose excessive rationality is
good news for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>. (Full disclosure: 
                  Slate
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">'s Jacob Weisberg</ENAMEX>
wrote the piece.) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rubin</ENAMEX> obsessively uses probabilities to weigh and reweigh the
risks and rewards of every decision. He <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judges</ENAMEX> decisions on their logic at the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>, not their eventual outcome--the antithesis of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>-think. His
strategy on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asian</ENAMEX> crisis has paid off, with no <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> crash in sight.
... A piece profiles <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lachlan Murdoch</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rupert</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heir</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corp</ENAMEX> throne. A young (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">26</NUMEX>) and tattooed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bachelor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lachlan</ENAMEX> seems an unlikely
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">media baron</ENAMEX>, but he manages to be simultaneously tough and charming. His taste,
like his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX>'s, runs to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tabloid</ENAMEX>.

               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> 's cover package hypes online shopping, which is now efficient and
safe on sites such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amazon.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDnow</ENAMEX>, and E*TRADE. But online shopping
hasn't made it yet: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amazon.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX> is worth <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$5 billion</NUMEX> on the market but has lost
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$30 million</NUMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX> and isn't close to turning a profit. ... A
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> story says <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">transsexuals</ENAMEX> are gaining political clout. They
are demanding (and getting) anti-discrimination laws at the state level. Now
they wish <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gays</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lesbians</ENAMEX> would stop excluding them from homosexual rights
campaigns.

            

               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek</ENAMEX> 's cover story examines the convergence of science and religion.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Scientists</ENAMEX> were once ostracized for holding religious beliefs but can now
worship without embarrassment. Religious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are finding evidence of God in
recent scientific discoveries. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Outcomes</ENAMEX> determined by "chaos" and the
randomness of radioactive decay are actually specific results chosen by God.)
... An article wonders what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary Clinton</ENAMEX> will do after she leaves the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Publishers</ENAMEX> say her book career is more promising than her
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">husband's</ENAMEX>, and her lecture fees might approach <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$60,000</NUMEX> per speech. (She'll need
the dough to cover her legal expenses--see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Nation</ENAMEX> , below.)
... A story reports on haggling over ownership of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Zapruder</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">film</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JFK</ENAMEX>'s assassination. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> wants to buy it for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$3 million</NUMEX>. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zapruder</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> is demanding <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$18 million</NUMEX>, wanting no "blood money" but figuring
it could fetch <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$70 million</NUMEX> on the open market. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> says that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abraham</ENAMEX>
Zapruder, after witnessing tragedy through his lens, "never looked through a
camera again."

            The
cosmology cover story wonders if there are other universes.
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conclusion</ENAMEX>: maybe.) Through diagrams and interviews with physicists, the story
describes how separate universes could break away from ours (a bit like a soap
bubble dividing in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>). One theory posits a "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>" universe--a forever
unchanging world from which "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX>" universes can grow. ... A
piece claims that corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> now supports napping.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Companies</ENAMEX> offer dark, quiet nap <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX>, reasoning that <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midday</TIMEX> naps help workers
maintain focus.

            The issue
overshadowed by news of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tina Brown</ENAMEX>'s departure as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX>. A long story reports
on an evangelical <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmer</ENAMEX> and an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israeli</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rabbi</ENAMEX> who want to bring red
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cows</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX>. An obscure biblical passage states that a perfectly red cow
must be sacrificed in order for the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Messiah</ENAMEX> to return. (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Red</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cows</ENAMEX> are plentiful
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> but quite rare in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Middle East</ENAMEX>.) Both <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">fundamentalist Christians</ENAMEX> support the shipment of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cow embryos</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> as a
means of accelerating the apocalypse. ... An article by newly appointed
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Remnick</ENAMEX> follows the story of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> young <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Amish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> caught selling
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocaine</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Amish</ENAMEX> allow a period of freedom before baptism, during which young
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> drink, take <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>, and use machinery and electricity. The recent case
has the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Amish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> fretting over how to stop the encroachment of outside
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">society</ENAMEX>.

            Part <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> of
a long article on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reagans</ENAMEX>. The theme this time: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nancy</ENAMEX> as the power behind
the scenes. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nancy</ENAMEX> shaped the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cabinet</ENAMEX>, pushing her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> toward moderate
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> over <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">extremists</ENAMEX>, and she led the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reagans</ENAMEX> into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Georgetown</ENAMEX> society.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald</ENAMEX> is portrayed (against type) as tough and competent: At <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> private
summit meeting, he looked at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mikhail Gorbachev</ENAMEX> and said, "I just want to let

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spielberg</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Saving Private Ryan</ENAMEX> . The opening scene is "an overture of

demonstration of peak-form filmmaking."
