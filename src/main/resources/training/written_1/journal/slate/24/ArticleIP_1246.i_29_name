            The
cover editorial welcomes the impeachment or resignation of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>. He has lied to both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enemies</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">presidency</ENAMEX> is powerless without moral authority. "This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX> has no wish
for him to stay. And it is hard to see why <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> should, either." ...
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Economist</ENAMEX> applies its anti-protectionism stance to cultural protectionism. International fears of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
cultural hegemony are overblown. No <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> should attempt to keep out <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
music or movies, since no matter how successful <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> culture is, homegrown
products will always be more popular with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locals</ENAMEX>.

            A cover
piece offers a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Freudian</ENAMEX> take on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Flytrap</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> is the primal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>, who has
claimed sexual access to all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. According to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Freud</ENAMEX>'s "myth of the origin of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">civilization</ENAMEX>," the primal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> must be destroyed for society to survive
(though <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> might then be reborn as the repentant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX>). Also: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newspapers</ENAMEX>
are society's ego, and editorial pages are the superego. ... A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Russian</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">journalist</ENAMEX> warns that her <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>'s economic collapse may destroy its free
press. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Banks</ENAMEX>, which own or control much of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX>, are too broke to support
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX> and TV <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stations</ENAMEX>. Already the national media are ignoring the looming
war in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">republic</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dagestan</ENAMEX> because they can't afford to cover
it.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George W. Bush</ENAMEX> (see the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Weekly Standard</ENAMEX> , below). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> partied
hard in his youth, but getting married and giving up <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> focused him. He's
toned down his social conservatism, and his hugely likable personality makes
him a great <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">campaigner</ENAMEX>. (He's not much of a policy wonk, however.) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Critics</ENAMEX> say
his greatest asset is his name, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> seems to have emerged from his
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>'s shadow. ... Another profile of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gerhard Schröder</ENAMEX> (see
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. News</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The New Yorker</ENAMEX> , below). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schröder</ENAMEX>'s similarity to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Clinton</ENAMEX> is remarkable: both were raised by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poor</ENAMEX>, single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX>; were
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governors</ENAMEX> of "small, politically marginal" <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>; and eschew right and left
politics in favor of a new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> difference: Schröder hates emotional
displays, claiming he "can't abide pathos." ... A story argues that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nike</ENAMEX>'s "swoosh" logo has become too familiar. To many, the swoosh symbolizes
exploited foreign labor, and hip young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> now choose <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adidas</ENAMEX> as an
alternative to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nike</ENAMEX>'s hegemony. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nike</ENAMEX> is pinning its comeback on its one
incontrovertible success: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Jordan</ENAMEX>'s endorsement.

<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX>'s excuse is that most supposed similarities are "scenes à
