            The
cover editorial predicts that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>'s single currency
will lead to political confusion. The enormous, powerful monetary union will be
forced to take political stands (on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asian</ENAMEX> fiscal crisis, for example), but
it's not clear how member <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nations</ENAMEX> will agree what stands to take. ... A
story says microwaves are being used to clear minefields. Portable microwave
units heat the moist earth that surrounds <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mines</ENAMEX> but leave the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mines</ENAMEX> themselves
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unheated</ENAMEX>. Infrared cameras then use the temperature difference to find the
buried explosives.

            The cover
story deplores <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">liberals</ENAMEX>' embrace of the tobacco tax. The tax <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) is regressive;
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) won't reduce teen smoking; and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) won't be used to aid those who will
disproportionately pay it. Under <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s plan "<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than one-quarter</NUMEX> of the
cigarette-tax revenues remain for programs that help the less prosperous."
... A story wonders why we don't tax fat instead of cigarettes. While
higher cigarette taxes don't convince the poor to stop smoking, studies have

hack their computers, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX> now hire them as security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultants</ENAMEX>.

            An essay
claims the left and the right now function solely in reaction to "the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reagan</ENAMEX>
revolution" and "the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sixties</ENAMEX>," respectively. The right cannot understand that
ordinary <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> sparked the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">'60s</NUMEX> cultural revolution. The left cannot
understand that ordinary <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> caused the Reagan-era shift toward anti-tax
corporatism. Since these movements occurred within the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX>, they
now coexist, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">'60s</NUMEX> morals and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">'80s</ENAMEX> politics attest. Young
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> work in a corporate world by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX> but play in a "moral and cultural
universe shaped by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sixties</ENAMEX>." The author urges both sides to admit defeat
and move on.
