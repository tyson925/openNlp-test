<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Records</ENAMEX>). The born-again <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crooner</ENAMEX> ("<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elvis</ENAMEX> without the pelvis")
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">reinvents</ENAMEX> himself as a heavy-metal rocker, recording covers of songs from <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Judas</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Priest</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AC/DC</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metallica</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Reviewers</ENAMEX> are skeptical. "What's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boone</ENAMEX> up to?
Same as always, shoplifting other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folk</ENAMEX>'s style and music," says
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsday</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Les Payne</ENAMEX>--only this time, "this professional <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX>" is
borrowing from "the same [<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">musicians</ENAMEX> he] denounced <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few years back</TIMEX> as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sons</ENAMEX>
and warlocks of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Satan</ENAMEX>." The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicago Tribune</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Killian</ENAMEX> calls him
"a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traitor</ENAMEX> to his epoch, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Benedict Arnold of Bucks</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Button-Down</ENAMEX>." (Listen

<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Volcano</ENAMEX> , opens in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dante's Peak</ENAMEX> gives movie <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX>
an occasion to reaffirm a movie-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critic</ENAMEX>'s article of faith: the efficacy of
generic formulas and special effects, trite though they may be. "Disaster
movies are our millennial No plays, totally stylized, totally predictable, but
comforting in their familiarity" (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Schickel</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX>). "The movie ... has a visual energy all its own--a
blizzard of boulders, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> blanketed with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mauve ash</ENAMEX>, a bridge cracking
apart and dumping its cargo of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> into a river" (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe Morgenstern</ENAMEX>, the Wall
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Street Journal</ENAMEX> ). "The stupid thing gets the job done" (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Denby</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">York</ENAMEX> ). <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Critics</ENAMEX> interpret the sudden outcropping of natural-disaster movies
as nostalgia for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the '70s</TIMEX> and films such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">The Poseidon Adventure</ENAMEX> and
Jaws , "some of whose plot elements have been recycled here," says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Denby</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce Brosnan</ENAMEX> wins praise for adding a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personality</ENAMEX> to his picture-perfect

                (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gramercy Pictures</ENAMEX>). High praise for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leon Gast</ENAMEX>'s
debut documentary about the "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Rumble in the Jungle</ENAMEX>," the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1974</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Muhammad Ali</ENAMEX> vs.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Foreman</ENAMEX> championship bout fought in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Zaire</ENAMEX>. High praise for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ali</ENAMEX>, too:
"[H]is charisma makes the film" (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Corliss</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> ). The film's
highlights: on-screen commentary from ringside <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spectators</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norman Mailer</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Plimpton</ENAMEX>, music by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Brown</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.B. King</ENAMEX>, and displays of eloquence

humor and cinematography (mostly rugged mountain vistas). The Wall Street
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morgenstern</ENAMEX> says it is "unexpectedly affecting, a tragicomedy
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about</NUMEX> ordinary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> who might have been <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GIs</ENAMEX> caught up in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vietnam</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bill</ENAMEX>

                  What <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Falls Away</ENAMEX>: A Memoir
               , by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mia Farrow</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nan A.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Talese/Doubleday</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Woody Allen</ENAMEX>'s rehabilitation suffers a setback.
Ex-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girlfriend</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Farrow</ENAMEX> levels some familiar charges (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allen</ENAMEX> put his face in the
lap of their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dylan</ENAMEX>, and kept pornographic <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Polaroids</ENAMEX> of
Soon <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yi</ENAMEX>) but adds instances of pettier meanness (he lashed out at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Farrow</ENAMEX> when
she invited him to her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">sixth</NUMEX>-grade graduation). Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> find Farrow
credible. In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">novelist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacquelyn Mitchard</ENAMEX> says the elegance of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Farrow</ENAMEX>'s prose exonerates her of the charge that she is crazy. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> 's
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martha Duffy</ENAMEX> compares the memoir to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Katharine Graham</ENAMEX>'s. Like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Graham</ENAMEX>, Farrow
"questions her own passivity in dealing with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and blames herself." But
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carol Sarler</ENAMEX> argues that writing the book
constitutes <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> abuse, in a way: "[<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>]here are forms of abuse other than the
violent or the sexual. And <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of them is hanging your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>'s privacy out
to dry when you have a book to sell." (See <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Doubleday</ENAMEX>'s plug for the book.)

            

               
                  Before the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Dawn</ENAMEX>: An Autobiography
               , by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gerry Adams</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">William Morrow</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Co.</ENAMEX>). No bloody details stain this memoir by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sinn Fein</ENAMEX> (the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Irish Republican Army</ENAMEX>'s political <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX>). Reviewers view <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adams</ENAMEX>' decision to
remain opaque as a political necessity. Admitting to an active part in IRA
violence would have landed him in jail. But since <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adams</ENAMEX> opted instead to write
a diatribe against the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> occupation of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Northern Ireland</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> dismiss
the book as a facile rant. Writing in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Weekly Standard</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stuart Reid</ENAMEX>,
an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daily Telegraph</ENAMEX> , a conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> paper, says
that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adams</ENAMEX>' political reinterpretation of his past "is so transparent as to
make you turn away in watery-eyed embarrassment."

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hyped Infinite Jest</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Reviewers</ENAMEX> note that the essays, like the
book, are long (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">97</NUMEX> pages about a cruise-ship voyage, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">54</NUMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Illinois State</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fair</ENAMEX>) and playful ("He trounces words; he pivots on commas; he drops in and out
of styles like a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vaudevillian</ENAMEX> who lets the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> watch him change costumes
right there on stage," says the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los Angeles Times</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Susan Salter</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reynolds</ENAMEX>). The question: Is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wallace</ENAMEX> a postmodern ironist, sarcastic to the
point of annoyance? Or is there seriousness underneath the mordancy? In
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsday</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Wood</ENAMEX> optimistically proposes the latter: "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">One</ENAMEX> feels
behind the postmodernism an old realist modernist grinding away, eager to
notate reality (though in funky ways)." (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Click</ENAMEX> here for more on
