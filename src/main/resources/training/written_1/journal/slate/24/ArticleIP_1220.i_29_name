            The cover
editorial slams <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>'s sluggishness in combating <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">mad cow disease</ENAMEX>. The
government should have advised the public earlier about risks (as it did with
<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX>) and should have spent more on research (a cure is still nowhere in
sight). ... A story accuses the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Health Organization</ENAMEX> of placing
politics before the truth. WHO <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1</TIMEX>) downplayed findings that secondhand smoke is
less harmful than was previously thought and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) may suppress work linking
nuclear testing to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">thyroid cancer</ENAMEX> because it conflicts with a study done by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>. ... An article wonders who owns the moon. A <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1967</ENAMEX> treaty
says it "belongs to all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mankind</ENAMEX>," but <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mineral</ENAMEX> exploration <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> think
they've found loopholes allowing them to mine for profit. ... A story
says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tony Blair</ENAMEX>'s love affair with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> pop <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stars</ENAMEX> has gone awry. Bands such
as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oasis</ENAMEX>, once <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blair</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supporters</ENAMEX>, have found that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Labor</ENAMEX> is less progressive
than it seemed (particularly on funding for the arts) and have cut ties to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blair</ENAMEX>. True to its free market principles, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Economist</ENAMEX> decides "there
is a flaw in the argument that a generous welfare state generates good pop
music: <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>."

            The cover
story deflates the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Greenspan</ENAMEX> myth. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pols</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">financiers</ENAMEX>, and the public credit
the fed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> with the economy's success and trust his judgment on everything.

empty <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">office</ENAMEX>.) In fact, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspan</ENAMEX> has done next to nothing for the economy
(changing interest rates once since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>), and his judgment is simply
predictable conservatism. ... The editorial calls for the elimination of
the independent-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counsel</ENAMEX> law. The law encourages wasteful spending and intrusive
investigations: "Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> independent counsels have spent a total of
more than <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$80 million</NUMEX>." ... A story describes the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ambulance</ENAMEX>-chasing
spurred by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX> case. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">D.C.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> scramble for big-name <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clients</ENAMEX>, but
many settle for lesser game: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> was retained by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vernon Jordan</ENAMEX>'s limo
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">driver</ENAMEX>.

            The cover
story claims that "the chances of a nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> have arguably never been
higher." The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> continue to aim <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of warheads at
each other, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, despite signing the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">START I</ENAMEX> commitment to

research rocket launched from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Norway</ENAMEX> brought <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> "<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a couple of minutes</TIMEX>" away
from a decision to launch a retaliatory strike. ... A profile gently

(he says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edison</ENAMEX> invented the telephone), and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> think him a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">social</ENAMEX>-climbing loony. In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Johnson</ENAMEX>'s defense: He's a "controversialist" who
likes starting political battles. (Full disclosure:
