                  The
Lost World
                (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Universal Pictures</ENAMEX>). As invariably occurs upon the release
of a new <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spielberg</ENAMEX> blockbuster, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> complain about the lack of plot and the
unconvincing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audiences</ENAMEX> shell out a record-setting amount of money
on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">opening weekend</TIMEX> (in this case, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$92.7 million</NUMEX>). "Essentially a digital
version of your basic, primeval <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BOO</ENAMEX>! flick," says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Kroll</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek</ENAMEX> . Yet even the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">skeptics</ENAMEX> love the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dinosaurs</ENAMEX>. "The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Lost</ENAMEX>
World is the very essence of a thrill ride, shamelessly designed, ... [but]
there's some passion in the action, a lilt to the chases, a fluid lyricism in
the way the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">beasts</ENAMEX> move across hapless <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> who cross their paths" (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe</ENAMEX>
Morgenstern, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> ). (See <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">David</ENAMEX>

                  Addicted to Love
                (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner Bros.</ENAMEX>). The critical consensus on this
romantic comedy: more sadism than laughs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Griffin Dunne</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actors</ENAMEX> Meg
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ryan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matthew Broderick</ENAMEX> meant to turn the darker sides of voyeurism and
revenge into lighthearted fare; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> say they failed. "It gives us the
impression that we're supposed to take drastic, irrational revenge as a larky
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">laff riot</ENAMEX>," says the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los Angeles Times</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kevin Thomas</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pans</ENAMEX> also for the
normally sunny <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ryan</ENAMEX>, miscast here as a leather-clad bitch bent on punishing her
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ex</ENAMEX>: "The same way a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Care Bear</ENAMEX> is a teeth-baring grizzly" (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Susan Wloszczyna</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA Today</ENAMEX> ). (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Addicted to Love</ENAMEX> site has a plot summary as well as stills

                (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Miramax</ENAMEX>). Mixed reviews for a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> "working class
comedy" about <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Yorkshire</ENAMEX> coal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">miners</ENAMEX> downsized by Thatcherism, and about their
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brass band</ENAMEX>. The movie's simple-minded <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Tory</ENAMEX>-baiting "wears its bleeding heart
conspicuously on its sleeve," says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Holden</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> .
"You might feel like one of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">miners</ENAMEX>--manipulated, misled and
maneuvered into an emotional corner," says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Anderson</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>
Times . The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Yorker</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anthony Lane</ENAMEX>, however, praises the movie's
feel for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> working <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX>, "forced to sustain their flagging <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">souls</ENAMEX> by
quickness of wit." (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Click here for Brassed Off</ENAMEX> 's site.)

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven Bochco</ENAMEX>'s legal drama, a critical darling but a popular flop, enjoys a

<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">17 paroled convicts</TIMEX>. "As improbable yet as irresistible as any beach book you

                (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Amsterdam Theater</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Disney</ENAMEX> stages its first
production in its refurbished <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">42 nd</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Street</ENAMEX> theater. So far, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">theater</ENAMEX> has got the better marks. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ben Brantley</ENAMEX> calls
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Disney</ENAMEX>'s musical version of the biblical story, with a score by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Menken</ENAMEX>
( The Little Mermaid ) and lyrics by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tim Rice</ENAMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Evita</ENAMEX> ), "a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goliath</ENAMEX>
of a yawn." <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Linda Winer</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsday</ENAMEX> deems the score forgettable, "an
ambitious and derivative example of the
it's-so-loud-and-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">humorless</NUMEX>-it-must-be-art style." <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Simon</ENAMEX>
suggests that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David "</ENAMEX>may well be the worst musical ever perpetrated. ...
It's a new genre, a horrortorio." (See the "Summary

occasions re-evaluations of the most mainstream <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beatle</ENAMEX>--turns out he's not the

megastardom with level-headedness and acumen." The new album, which is rife
with unabashed <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fab Four</ENAMEX> nostalgia, draws warm praise. "The old bloke sounds
more inspired and, well, less goofy than he has in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>" (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elysa Gardner</ENAMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> ). However, a few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> call the songs more Wings
than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Beatles</ENAMEX>: "He has done some sucky stuff in his long and partially
illustrious career, but it has to be said that, overall, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McCartney</ENAMEX> has never
sounded less necessary" (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andy Gill</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Independent</ENAMEX> ). (See the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Flaming Pie</ENAMEX> site.)

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guevara</ENAMEX>: A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Revolutionary Life</ENAMEX>
               , by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jon Lee Anderson</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grove Press</ENAMEX>). The
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> major biography of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cuban</ENAMEX> guerrilla--along with several forthcoming
movies and his appearance on watch faces and album covers--is said to mark a
reprise of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Che Chic</ENAMEX>, with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Che</ENAMEX> as a pop icon, devoid of political import. The
biography itself, which uses unpublished <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diaries</ENAMEX> and untapped <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cuban</ENAMEX> government
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">archives</ENAMEX>, is praised for having done a "masterly job in evoking <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Che</ENAMEX>'s complex
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX>, in separating the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> from the myth" (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Canby</ENAMEX>, the New York
Times <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Book Review</ENAMEX> ). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Weekly Standard</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Schwartz</ENAMEX> calls it
tainted for having received "official support" from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Castro</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX> and for
abetting a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Che</ENAMEX> revival.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morris</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Random House</ENAMEX>). A very friendly reception for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> volume of a

<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalist-playwright-congresswoman-ambassadors</ENAMEX> in history, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Luce</ENAMEX>. "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morris</ENAMEX> has written a model biography of a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> who, if born a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>, could easily have been a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX>," says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Luce</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">friend Gore Vidal</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The New Yorker</ENAMEX> . Reviews dwell on the book's dishy
detail, derived from Luce's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diaries</ENAMEX>. Time deems the book "definitive"
but too harsh: "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morris</ENAMEX> struggles for fairness but portrays Luce as a
calculating, self-indulgent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> whose fixed eye on the main chance rendered
her oblivious to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concerns</ENAMEX> of others." (See <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Margaret</ENAMEX>
