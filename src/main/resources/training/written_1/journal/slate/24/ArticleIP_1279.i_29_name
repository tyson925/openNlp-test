                (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">th Century Fox</ENAMEX>). The backlash against
natural-disaster movies shifts into high gear. Despite <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Volcano</ENAMEX> 's
superior special effects, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> deem it inferior to the last volcano movie,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dante's Peak</ENAMEX> . Problems: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) The plot, or the lack thereof. "Without
special effects as the main attraction, there would be no movie here at all,"
writes the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Janet Maslin</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) Overacting by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stars</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tommy</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lee Jones</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anne Heche</ENAMEX>, in lieu of actual roles to play. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) A volcano that is
both implausible and boring. "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Volcano</ENAMEX> is a movie without a villain or a
mystery. The volcano has no quirks of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personality</ENAMEX>, because it has no
personality. Defeating it is a breeze, because it is dumb, mechanical, and
predictable" (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">David Plotz, Slate</ENAMEX>. Also see the official Volcano page.)

                (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buena Vista Pictures</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Classic</ENAMEX> chick flick or a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bad Bill & Ted</ENAMEX> knockoff? The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maslin</ENAMEX> says that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mira Sorvino</ENAMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mighty Aphrodite</ENAMEX> ) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lisa Kudrow</ENAMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Friends</ENAMEX> ), in
their roles as bimbettes avenging the wrongs of high school, "elevat[e]
bubble-headedness to new levels of comic ingenuity." The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Desson Howe</ENAMEX> calls the film a "sublime comedy" about "bitchiness
[and] <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">oneupwomanship</ENAMEX>." But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Variety</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Todd McCarthy</ENAMEX> says the movie "looks
like a peroxided <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clueless</ENAMEX> wannabe straggling along to the party <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> after it's over." (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Click</ENAMEX> here for

                  Locked in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cabinet</ENAMEX>
               , by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Reich</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Knopf</ENAMEX>). Whatever their
ideological stripe, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> agree that the former labor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX>'s
self-deprecating style (he makes a lot of jokes about being short) masks a
massive ego (he thinks he has all the answers). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Weekly Standard</ENAMEX> 's
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrew Ferguson</ENAMEX> says, "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reich</ENAMEX> leaves the 'nuts and bolts' of politics a
supremely unhappy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>, convinced as strongly as ever of his superiority to its
processes, its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">practitioners</ENAMEX>, and to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who gave him the coolest job he'll
ever have." However, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reviewers</ENAMEX> do praise <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reich</ENAMEX>'s lucid prose, pointed
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">observations</ENAMEX>, and sense of humor: "There is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thurberesque</ENAMEX> side to him" (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Evan</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times Book Review</ENAMEX> ). (See <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herbert</ENAMEX>

                  Anything <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Your Little Heart Desires: An American Family Story</ENAMEX>
               , by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Patricia Bosworth</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Simon & Schuster</ENAMEX>). Not all memoirs are evil.
Critical approbation for this one about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bosworth</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bartley Crum</ENAMEX>, a
corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> who represented <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Randolph Hearst</ENAMEX> and the "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Hollywood 10</ENAMEX>"
and committed suicide during the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCarthy</ENAMEX> era. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bosworth</ENAMEX>, the biographer of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diane Arbus</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montgomery Clift</ENAMEX>, "provides a vivid sense of upper-middle-class
life in the early <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Cold War</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, when prominent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> suddenly turned their
backs on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crum</ENAMEX> and called them <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Communist</ENAMEX> dupes," writes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kathy</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deacon</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Village Voice</ENAMEX> . In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times Book Review</ENAMEX> ,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Lingeman</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bosworth "</ENAMEX>tells her elegiac story in a tone that is
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">admirably</ENAMEX> restrained, in prose that conveys strong feeling by
understatement."

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Epidemics</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Modern Media</ENAMEX>
               , by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elaine Showalter</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia University</ENAMEX>
Press). The feminist literary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critic</ENAMEX>'s claim that the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Gulf War</ENAMEX> and
chronic-fatigue syndromes are merely psychological <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">maladies</ENAMEX> meets with
predictably high levels of vitriol. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times Book Review</ENAMEX> ,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">social</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">psychologist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carol Tavris</ENAMEX> takes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Showalter</ENAMEX> to task for using literary
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Freudianism</ENAMEX> to explain real problems: "Sometimes a headache is a 'language of
distress' and sometimes it's a tumor." Also, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tavris</ENAMEX> says recent revelations
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Gulf War</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> may indeed have been exposed to chemical <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX> belie
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Showalter</ENAMEX>'s case. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Republic</ENAMEX> , the anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Freudian Frederick Crews</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">describes Showalter</ENAMEX>'s theory of hysteria as itself an "attempt to whip up a
little hysteria." (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia University Press</ENAMEX> plugs the book.)

                  Titanic
                (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lunt-Fontanne Theatre</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York City</ENAMEX>). Surprisingly, the
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$10 million</NUMEX> spectacular isn't <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Broadway</ENAMEX>'s all-time biggest flop. But "that is
probably the most exciting thing that can be said about it," says the New
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">York Times</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ben Brantley</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Critics</ENAMEX> complain that the musical fails to
deliver the extravagant sets and staging they've come to expect from theatrical
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">blockbusters</ENAMEX>. By sidestepping obvious clich√©s (rushing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowds</ENAMEX>, crashing waves)
in an effort "to make a sensitive and tasteful show about a trashy subject,"
says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsday</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Linda Winer</ENAMEX>, the production achieves only "banality."

Apparently, not even the sure-fire plot machinations of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lillian Hellman</ENAMEX> and
beguiling wiles of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actress</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stockard Channing</ENAMEX> can rescue this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lincoln Center</ENAMEX>
production from its pretensions. The play "is so wildly miscast and so
haplessly misconceived that it is hard to figure out what its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">creators</ENAMEX> exactly
had in mind," says the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brantley</ENAMEX>. (His best guess: a
Freudian essay on lovelessness and neurosis.) The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> 's
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lloyd Rose</ENAMEX> calls the production "a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">preachy</ENAMEX> bore."

City). The bad <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> of modern dance takes on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lou Harrison</ENAMEX>, the eclectic
classical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">composer</ENAMEX>. "As you watch the stage, your brain seems to get bigger,
your life more interesting," says the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joan</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acocella</ENAMEX>. The main attraction: a live orchestra (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Yo-Yo</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Ma</ENAMEX> played opening
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>). Also, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morris</ENAMEX>' much-praised penchant for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dancers</ENAMEX> with unusually shaped
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX>. "It is unique among the major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> of its kind in looking utterly
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human</ENAMEX>, like a cross-section of real <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who just happen to move vividly or
be capable of generating a potent atmosphere" (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tobi Tobias</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New</ENAMEX>
