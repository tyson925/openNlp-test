<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Century Fox</ENAMEX>). The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> film in the Star Wars trilogy takes in <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$24</NUMEX>
million its opening <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekend</TIMEX> and receives rave reviews. "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Empire Strikes</ENAMEX>
Back is the best of three Star Wars films," declares the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicago</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sun-Times</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger Ebert</ENAMEX>. "It managed to prefigure the power-mad <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">80</TIMEX>'s," says
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Janet Maslin</ENAMEX>, comparing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Darth Vader</ENAMEX> to

are said to have matured into actual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> (as opposed to cartoon ones),
and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sage</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yoda</ENAMEX> makes his <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> appearance, "emerg[ing] from murky nature to
become the spiritual center of the whole <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Star</ENAMEX> 
               Wars game," says
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">San Francisco Chronicle</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Stack</ENAMEX>. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate's Louis</ENAMEX>

                (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">October Films</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Critics</ENAMEX> denounce <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Lynch</ENAMEX>'s
latest picture as a soulless knockoff of other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lynch</ENAMEX> movies ( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blue</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Velvet</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Wild</ENAMEX> at 
               <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Heart , Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me</ENAMEX> ).
"We've visited this planet before," says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Corliss</ENAMEX>. Among the elements of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lynch</ENAMEX>'s
self-plagiarism: an eerie soundtrack, creepy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> ( femmes fatales ,
scary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">thugs</ENAMEX>, ghoulish freak), and lots of tawdry sex. Also, a shaggy-dog plot
that defies the laws of time and space. "The cries of 'Cheat!' that attended
the later episodes of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Twin Peaks</ENAMEX> are likely to be heard again," says
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Edelstein</ENAMEX>. On the other hand, the film is said to look
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">great</ENAMEX>--"magnificent in the painterly way Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lynch</ENAMEX> pioneered," says the Wall
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Street Journal</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe Morgenstern</ENAMEX>. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lost Highway</ENAMEX>'s official site serves up bizarre

deemed important as history but insignificant as art. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Singleton</ENAMEX>
( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boyz N the Hood</ENAMEX> ) is accused of sentimentalizing his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subject</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resorting</ENAMEX> to action-film banalities--"a sorry assortment of dramatic and visual
clich√©s that were retired from service, or should have been, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades ago</TIMEX>," says

showed without ads, under the sponsorship of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX>. But the praise is tempered
by the observation that the film came in a package deal with Jurassic
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Park</ENAMEX> and was broadcast in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the middle of February</TIMEX> sweeps. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Critics</ENAMEX> note two

               , by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Gregory Dunne</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Random</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX>). The inside story of how <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dunne</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joan Didion</ENAMEX> turned the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jessica</ENAMEX>

the cover of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 2</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times Book Review</ENAMEX> , although
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">screenwriter Larry Gelbart</ENAMEX> summarizes, rather than evaluates, the book:
"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Monster</ENAMEX> offers a crash course in getting a script through the hazards
of the present-day studio system." In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los Angeles Times</ENAMEX> ,
producer/<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Crichton</ENAMEX> applauds <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dunne</ENAMEX>'s breezy, professional tone:
"Shock and petty <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">moralizing</ENAMEX> are the mark of an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">outsider</ENAMEX>." The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Review of Books</ENAMEX> complains that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dunne</ENAMEX> is too breezy: "This is what
makes him so readable, but it doesn't give him a voice for brooding."

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ellis</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Knopf</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Historian Ellis</ENAMEX> earns praise for his contribution to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jefferson</ENAMEX>
scholarship. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ellis</ENAMEX>' twist: He's a moderate who neither censures the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Declaration of Independence</ENAMEX> for his conflicted views on race nor dismisses
his political beliefs as insincere. "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jeffersonism</ENAMEX> is not <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clintonism</ENAMEX>," says
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">historian Sean Wilentz</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Republic</ENAMEX> . The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicago Tribune</ENAMEX> ,
however, concludes that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Sphinx</ENAMEX> makes manifest so many
inconsistencies in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jefferson</ENAMEX>'s thought that it may unwittingly be "the most
critical biography of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jefferson</ENAMEX> published in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this century</TIMEX>." (For more on the

                  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whittaker Chambers</ENAMEX>: A Biography
               , by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam Tanenhaus</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Random House</ENAMEX>).
Tanenhaus elevates <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chambers</ENAMEX> to the pantheon of great <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> postwar
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intellectuals</ENAMEX> and declares <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alger Hiss</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spy</ENAMEX>, and no <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> object. Even
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nation</ENAMEX> , famously defensive on the question of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hiss</ENAMEX>, calls the
biography "an honest and indispensable book that goes a long way toward
restoring to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chambers</ENAMEX> an elementary human plausibility" (gosh, thanks).
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tanenhaus</ENAMEX> accuses <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chambers</ENAMEX> of having inadvertently instigated McCarthyism, and
"shows us <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chambers</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">paranoia</ENAMEX>, his introversion, his sententiousness" (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen</ENAMEX>

contribution to the flourishing genre of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painter</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as</NUMEX>-prick." <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Critics</ENAMEX> have proven

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Funeral</ENAMEX> , a quaint and titillating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bloomsbury</ENAMEX> parallelogram," says the
Wall Street <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Lyons</ENAMEX>. All praise is reserved for the
production itself: "The staging is infinitely inventive," says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">York</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Simon</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Actor Anthony Sher</ENAMEX>, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stanley</ENAMEX>, is "astonishing, as
