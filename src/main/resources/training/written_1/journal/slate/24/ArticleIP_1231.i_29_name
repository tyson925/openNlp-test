            The
cover editorial deplores rich <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>' lack of charity.
The newly wealthy don't give enough and don't give creatively. They are
breaking the "unspoken contract that underpins the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> dream." ...
An editorial urges strong sanctions for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> in light of its nuclear tests.
We must deter potential future <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">testers</ENAMEX> by making an example of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>,
despite <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>'s inevitable claims that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> started it and that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> is a
richer <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, better able to withstand sanctions. ... Latest <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Viagra</ENAMEX>
angle: Can it save endangered <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>? Among the endangered <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> poached for
aphrodisiacs are <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">tigers</ENAMEX> (for their penises--made into a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">soup</ENAMEX>) and rhinoceroses
