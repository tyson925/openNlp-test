editorial says the crash of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asian</ENAMEX> markets shouldn't have prompted the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
sell-off: <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asian</ENAMEX> markets have only a minor impact on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> economy. So why
did the sell-off occur? Mostly because of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">herd</ENAMEX> mentality of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX>. (For

Went <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Mad</ENAMEX>.") A story calls <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Africa</ENAMEX> the new hot spot for filmmaking. Its
advantages: great weather, varied scenery, and nonunion labor. Also, an article
notes <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX>' inability to discover a magnet with only one pole. Physicists
believe the Big Bang should have formed "monopoles," but they can't find or
make them.

story says falling crime rates have nothing to do with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX> crime
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bill</ENAMEX>. In fact, the bill is a failure: The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-strikes law clogs the courts
and fills <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prisons</ENAMEX> with older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inmates</ENAMEX> unlikely to commit serious crimes again;
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> will go broke paying for the "<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100,000</NUMEX> new cops" when federal seed money
runs out; and the assault-weapons ban has too many loopholes. Also, an essay
ascribes <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>'s athletic success to illegal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> use. At the recent

long-standing world records. (Priceless quote from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>'s swimming <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coach</ENAMEX>:
"Just as our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> dominate you now, so will our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> dominate you in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>,

<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 inches</NUMEX> long, has the circumference of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a quarter</TIMEX>, and angles to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> side. A
