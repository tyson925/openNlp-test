                  Underboss: <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Sammy the Bull Gravano's Story of Life</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mafia</ENAMEX>
               ,
by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Maas</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HarperCollins</ENAMEX>). Critical and commercial success for the
biography of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gravano</ENAMEX>, "the most famous snitch in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mob</ENAMEX> history," who brought down
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John</ENAMEX> "the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Teflon Don" Gotti</ENAMEX>, offed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, and ordered his own
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">brother-in-law</ENAMEX>'s execution. Drawing on extensive interviews with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bull</ENAMEX>, it
is a "brilliantly constructed and grimly fascinating ... morality play on the
subject of loyalty" (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Westlake</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times Book Review</ENAMEX> ).
Though it retreads tired observations about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mafia</ENAMEX> life, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Underboss</ENAMEX> still
enriches the "portrait of a subculture some of us can't get enough of" (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bruce</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Handy</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> ). (HarperCollins plugs the book.)

            
               
                  The
Actual: A Novella
               , by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saul Bellow</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viking</ENAMEX>). The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">81-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>'s
latest is admired as a "mature work": same old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bellovian</ENAMEX> subject (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> man
brooding over a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>), but a more subdued, elegiac tone. Almost everyone
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lavishes</ENAMEX> praise on the book, not minding the absurdities they find in the plot
(such as the emergence of a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">92-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trillionaire</ENAMEX> who befriends the brooding
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>). "The Actual is not a young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>'s piece of fiction. ... It is
instead something far more rare: the work of a great <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">master</ENAMEX> still locked in
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">unequal</ENAMEX> combat with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eros</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX>," says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis Begley</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX>
Book <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Review</ENAMEX> . "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bellow</ENAMEX> writes now with as much authority and energy as he did
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly half</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a century ago</TIMEX>" (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jonathan Yardley</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> ).

                (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 20</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8 p.m. EDT/PDT</TIMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roseanne</ENAMEX>'s finale after
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nine seasons</TIMEX> leaves <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reviewers unimpressed</ENAMEX>, but it occasions encomiums for the
show's working-class <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grit</ENAMEX>. "The most groundbreaking kitchen-sink sitcom since
All in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Family</ENAMEX> ," declares <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ken Tucker</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Entertainment Weekly</ENAMEX> .
Most agree, however, that the show declined in its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last years</TIMEX>, especially after
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roseanne</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> won the lottery and the family forsook its proletarian
roots--while the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actress</ENAMEX> herself mutated from caustic social <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critic</ENAMEX> into pop
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">icon</ENAMEX>. "A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rich</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roseanne Conner</ENAMEX>," says the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Caryn James</ENAMEX>,
"was as bizarre as the conspicuous physical makeover that no one in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conner</ENAMEX>
family ever mentioned." (See <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Plotz</ENAMEX>'s "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Assessment</ENAMEX>" of

                (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 19</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8 p.m. EDT/PDT</TIMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blaine</ENAMEX>,
a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hipster magician</ENAMEX> with a goatee and no fancy equipment, is
proclaimed a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">performer</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Copperfield</ENAMEX>. "Instead of
ornate props and gorgeous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">showgirls</ENAMEX>, he shares his act lovingly with ordinary
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>," writes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John O'Connor</ENAMEX> in the New York
Times . But many find an average <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">performer</ENAMEX> behind the populist hype. "Corny
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">card tricks</ENAMEX> and coin feints and levitation stunts [updated] with post-grunge

glitz subside during the festival's <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week</TIMEX>. It "reasserted its claim to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">seriousness</ENAMEX>," says the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Janet Maslin</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Credit</ENAMEX> is given to

some whining lingers. "The quintessential <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Cannes fortnight</ENAMEX>, indeed, would
involve no films at all--just invitations to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> that never happen and
rumors of films that will never be made," says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The New Yorker</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anthony</ENAMEX>

Lumet slaps together, they say, an implausible plot (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> after law school,

the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eric Brace</ENAMEX>.) Among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lumet</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defenders</ENAMEX> are the
