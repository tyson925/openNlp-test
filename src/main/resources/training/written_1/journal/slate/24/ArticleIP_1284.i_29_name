(<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rita Kempley</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> ). Even <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jonathan Lynn</ENAMEX>

(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Epic</ENAMEX>). The megastar of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">'80s</TIMEX> pop has hit bottom, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> say. Sales of his new
album are dismal, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reviewers</ENAMEX> complain that the music--<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> new songs and

Entertainment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Weekly</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Sinclair</ENAMEX>, has "gone the way of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jheri Curl</ENAMEX>

lyrics for their clich√©s and their misogyny, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackson</ENAMEX> for indulging in
self-pity that bleeds into self-parody. "Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackson</ENAMEX> seems like the elephant

               , by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Randall Kennedy</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pantheon Books</ENAMEX>).
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard Law</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX>'s book on race gets plaudits for its
equal-opportunity attacks on both the left (for tendentiously seeing racism
everywhere) and the right (for willfully seeing racism nowhere). "An admirable,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">courageous</ENAMEX> and meticulously fair and honest book," says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger Parloff</ENAMEX> in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times Book Review</ENAMEX> . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kennedy</ENAMEX>'s endorsement of extreme
race-neutrality--<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">race</ENAMEX> shouldn't be a factor in stopping criminal-suspect
searches or in assembling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">juries</ENAMEX>, he says--does strike a few as naive.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ellis Cose</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kennedy</ENAMEX> never resolves "the battle between
the ethical ideal he cherishes and the moral muddle of the actual world."

            

               
                  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Virginia Woolf</ENAMEX>
               , by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hermione Lee</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Knopf</ENAMEX>). After umpteen
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biographies</ENAMEX> celebrating "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bloomsbury</ENAMEX>'s mad feminist," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX>'s is saluted for
rediscovering the "real <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Woolf</ENAMEX>." A <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">academic</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> contends <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Woolf</ENAMEX> wasn't
nearly as mad as previous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biographers</ENAMEX> have alleged. Praise goes to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX>'s
argument, her sensitivity, and her writing. "[<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX>]e have a book worthy of its
subject--graceful, astonishingly well researched, yet imbued with a sense of
flow that is rarely achieved at this level of scholarship," says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daphne Merkin</ENAMEX>

fiction--about a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> as the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> takes
back control--comes less from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">novelist</ENAMEX> than the travel <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX>. His
evocation of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> is "full of sharp observations--on subjects ranging from
politics to food to sex to servitude" (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dwight Garner</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsday</ENAMEX> ). But his
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">protagonist</ENAMEX>, a misanthropic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">businessman</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Neville "Bunt</ENAMEX>" <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mullard</ENAMEX>, is deemed
poorly drawn. Glimpses into his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> "do not add up to a full motivation

"The exhibition almost never deviates from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Modern</ENAMEX>'s pantheon of anointed

of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minorities</ENAMEX>, and newer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Yorker</ENAMEX> 's Calvin
Tomkins, however, gives it a hearty endorsement. "Exhibitions that purport to

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hughes</ENAMEX>' much-touted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX> series on <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> art finally airs, generating a
