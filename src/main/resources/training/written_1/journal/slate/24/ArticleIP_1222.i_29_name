<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Economist</ENAMEX> , like everyone else, is baffled by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boris Yeltsin</ENAMEX>'s recent
dismissal of his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cabinet</ENAMEX>. The cover editorial says <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> is in surprisingly
decent economic shape, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeltsin</ENAMEX>'s infirmity could quash reforms and lead to
"crony capitalism" or possibly even communism. ... An editorial slams

going nuclear. The move would boost the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>'s popularity but would
provoke worldwide trade sanctions and heighten regional tensions. ... A

partly because the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> thought he would be "more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX> than
