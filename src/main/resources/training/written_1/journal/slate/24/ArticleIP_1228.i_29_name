            A story
deplores efforts by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporations</ENAMEX> to prevent economic sanctions against
rogue <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nations</ENAMEX>. A corporate umbrella <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>*Engage is lobbying fiercely
and successfully against sanctions: In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>, "<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX> sanctions were put in place;
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> ... were sanctioned." This is troubling, because
sanctions are more effective at undermining evil regimes than trading is at
democratizing them. ... A piece welcomes the proposed merger of the

it would create a unified voice on education. But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEA</ENAMEX> may be too defensive

says his new movie is the most radical political statement of his career. In
