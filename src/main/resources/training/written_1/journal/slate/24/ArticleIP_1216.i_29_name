            The
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Valentine's Day</TIMEX> cover story notes the globalization and professionalization of
the sex industry. The explosion of the sex trade in eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> has driven
down prices for prostitution and pornography worldwide. The real money is still
in upscale <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">strip clubs</ENAMEX>, high-class call-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> rings, and well-produced X-rated
videos. Good news for porn <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fans</ENAMEX>: The Internet makes it possible to learn which
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">brothels</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">strip clubs</ENAMEX> are reliable. ... A piece frets that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boris</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeltsin</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX> is damaging <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX>. His <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> has no coherent economic
policy, the budget is a joke, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeltsin</ENAMEX> is likely to be succeeded by a
hard-line authoritarian like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander Lebed</ENAMEX>. ... <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> hasn't escaped
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX>'s economic crisis, warns the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX>. Bad debts may total <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70 percent</NUMEX> of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>'s GDP, and government control over private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enterprise</ENAMEX> is
increasing. Unless <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> manages to dismantle its gigantic, interfering
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bureaucracy</ENAMEX> (which is unlikely), it too will face economic disaster.

            The
magazine bad-mouths its longtime <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Gore</ENAMEX> in a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-story cover package.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> piece raps the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">veep</ENAMEX>'s technorationalism: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> believes that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX> analysis
can solve any problem (environmental degradation, nuclear proliferation, etc.)
and doesn't understand emotionalism and power politics. This blind spot could
handicap his presidency. A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> piece berates <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> for supporting affirmative
action and accuses him of grossly distorting the views of affirmative-action
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponents</ENAMEX>. (For more on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX>, see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Krugman</ENAMEX>'s "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Algorithms</ENAMEX>.")

story: It bounced from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drudge Report</ENAMEX> to countless news outlets

<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">article</ENAMEX> explicates curling (shuffleboard on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> with brooms), "the one game in
