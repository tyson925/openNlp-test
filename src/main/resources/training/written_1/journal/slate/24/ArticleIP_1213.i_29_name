            A special
double issue makes the case for nuclear disarmament. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jonathan Schell</ENAMEX>'s cover story--the
longest article in The

The Fate of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX> . The article's conclusion: We should push for
"horizontal" disarmament (taking <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX> off alert, partially dismantling them)
rather than "vertical" disarmament (abolishing weapons altogether). ...
In an interview with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schell</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mikhail Gorbachev</ENAMEX> claims he proposed total
disarmament to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Politburo</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> adds that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kremlin</ENAMEX> briefings on nuclear
protocol baffled him. ... An essay pegged to <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Roe vs. Wade</ENAMEX> 's

            The cover
story says <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">liberals</ENAMEX> shouldn't get excited about the budget surplus because it

bark: According to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drudge Report</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek</ENAMEX> spiked a story about a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinton</ENAMEX>
affair with a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> intern. The story <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek</ENAMEX> does
run about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paula Jones</ENAMEX>' sexual-harassment suit says that her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> are trying
to prove that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> promoted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> who slept with him. As a result, they are

difference: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catholicism</ENAMEX> will outlast <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pope John Paul II</ENAMEX>; communism won't outlast

               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek</ENAMEX> 's health cover story--yet another one--argues that everyone is
slightly crazy. New genetic research suggests that the difference between
"normal" behavior and mental illness is a matter of degree. For example: A
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> gene for obsessive-compulsive disorder might be extremely
well-organized, but a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> for it might be dysfunctional.
