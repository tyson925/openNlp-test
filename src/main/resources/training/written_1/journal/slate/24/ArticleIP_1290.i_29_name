(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia Pictures</ENAMEX>). Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> find little resemblance between German
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolfgang Petersen</ENAMEX>'s "hokey" action flick and his near-classic Das
Boot . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harrison Ford</ENAMEX>'s turn as a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> who goes mano a mano

fantasy of being <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>" (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Denby</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> ). Reflecting a
general weariness with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX> fare, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The New Yorker</ENAMEX> 's
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Terrence Rafferty</ENAMEX> writes, "Let's hope they don't get any sillier than this."
But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Entertainment Weekly</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Owen Gleiberman</ENAMEX> praises <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Petersen</ENAMEX>'s ability to
"seduce you into greater and greater flights of preposterousness." (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Click</ENAMEX>

unusually close "friendship" with her <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Scottish</ENAMEX> manservant is said to reflect
both the virtues and flaws of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX> TV series: strong performances from
actors little known in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Antony Sher</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judi Dench</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Billy</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Connolly</ENAMEX>), but also a cloying pretentiousness and "decorousness" (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Janet Maslin</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> ). The movie "often feels pat and resolutely performed for
the camera, scene by scene," says the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morgenstern</ENAMEX>. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Video</ENAMEX> and stills are available here.)

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Searchlight</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lukewarm</ENAMEX> reviews for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miguel Arteta</ENAMEX>'s debut film, about a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">teen-age Latino</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prostitute</ENAMEX> who aspires to make it in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX>, and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>,
who <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pimps</ENAMEX> for him. Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> agree the film is heavy on melodrama, and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> is implausibly overbearing. "[<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>]he metaphor ... of a father
selling his son's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> is too outr√© to have much resonance" (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rafferty</ENAMEX>, The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Yorker</ENAMEX> ). Arteta, however, receives praise for his "realistic" style and
"flair for caustic storytelling" (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maslin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> ). "Star
Maps signals the arrival of a potentially major new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">talent</ENAMEX>," says

(<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">D.C.</ENAMEX>). High marks for the new <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$450 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>'s
"downtown" <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Critics</ENAMEX> cite the "spacious" and "user-friendly" design by
the noted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Haven</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cesar Pelli</ENAMEX>. The new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terminal</ENAMEX> is said to imitate
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Neo-Classical</ENAMEX> style, with rows of glass <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">domes</ENAMEX> and corridors of
columns. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Benjamin Forgey</ENAMEX> says the building bucks
recent trends in airport design that have "struggled to keep up with the
increasing popularity of air travel" by casting aside "such amenities as beauty
... comfort and convenience." Objecting to the enthusiasm is the New York
Times ' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herbert Muschamp</ENAMEX>, who criticizes the presence of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Disney</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGI</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX> in the "new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Washington Mall</ENAMEX>," and sarcastically
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">wonders</ENAMEX>, "why shouldn't an airport strive to be <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Macy's?</ENAMEX>"

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morrow & Co.</ENAMEX>). The backlash against domestic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">goddess</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martha Stewart</ENAMEX> reaches
it zenith with a new biography, currently No. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> '
Best <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sellers</ENAMEX> list, which claims that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stewart</ENAMEX> is even more of a bitch than
previously believed. (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> example: she allegedly plagiarizes recipes.)
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Reviewers</ENAMEX> don't quarrel much with the biography's slant, though they almost all
deride it as "mean-spirited." Maslin, however, instigates the backlash against
the backlash, calling <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stewart</ENAMEX> an "easy target," undeserving of such outraged
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fulminations</ENAMEX>: "Now it can be told: little <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martha Stewart ate Gulden</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mustard</ENAMEX>
on white <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bread</ENAMEX> as an after-school snack."

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goldstein</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Farrar, Straus & Giroux</ENAMEX>). Newly translated into <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hungarian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Nadas</ENAMEX>' <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">706</NUMEX>-page novel, written in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</TIMEX>, is virtually
enshrined into the canon by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX>. Reviews of this tale of a
bisexual <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hungarian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> in 1970s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East Berlin</ENAMEX> use such terms as "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Proustian</ENAMEX>"
(<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eva Hoffman</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times Book Review</ENAMEX> ) and "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">masterpiece"</ENAMEX> (Stanislaw
Baranczak, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Republic</ENAMEX> ). Praise goes to the novel's lyrical prose,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">innovative</ENAMEX> (some say "difficult") <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX>--which includes a novel within the
novel--and its arresting depiction of life behind the Iron Curtain. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baranczak</ENAMEX>'s
lavish review calls it "the book that you have been awaiting since you read
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Remembrance of Things Past , The Magic Mountain or The Man</ENAMEX>
Without Qualities ."
