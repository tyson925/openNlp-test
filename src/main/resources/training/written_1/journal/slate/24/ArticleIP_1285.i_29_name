                (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Touchstone Pictures</ENAMEX>). This action flick, about a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rogues</ENAMEX>' gallery
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prisoners</ENAMEX> who hijack a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">jet</ENAMEX>, is deemed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX>-blockbuster overkill: too many
ridiculous plot twists, too many explosions, too much ripping off of its
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">predecessors</ENAMEX>. It is "so monumentally idiotic, frenzied and cheesy--the special
effects look like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tonka</ENAMEX> toys writ large--that it re-sets the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX> for the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">genre</ENAMEX>," says the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe Morgenstern</ENAMEX>. Reviewers split
on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">star</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nicolas Cage</ENAMEX>. He either "emerges intact from the rubble" (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anthony</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lane</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The New Yorker</ENAMEX> ) or proves "he can be as much of an overmuscled
jackass as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sylvester Stallone"</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">David</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Edelstein, Slate</ENAMEX>). (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Click</ENAMEX> here for the

                (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Orion Pictures</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Fonda</ENAMEX>'s comeback--as a stoic
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">beekeeper</ENAMEX> facing down his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">convict son</ENAMEX>'s thuggish <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>--is called his first
worthy performance since <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Easy Rider</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1969</TIMEX>). "[A]fter all this time, a
role that suits his rocklike demeanor perfectly and makes virtues of his
expressive limitations" (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Terrence Rafferty</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The New Yorker</ENAMEX> ). Slow-paced
and minimalist, the film is hailed as an anti-blockbuster: It "achieves a rare,
and rarely earned, emotional depth ... ennobling and enriching without being
sticky or sanctimonious" (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Todd McCarthy</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Variety</ENAMEX> ). (See <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edelstein</ENAMEX>'s

<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Greenaway</ENAMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Cook, the Thief, His Wife & Her</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lover</ENAMEX> ) elicits a familiar critique: It's judged a visual knockout but
pretentious as hell. Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> say the movie, about a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>'s
peculiar fetish, has lots of gorgeous naked <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> but little plot or character
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX>. A "cold, contemptuous, and interminable Oedipal saga," says the
Village <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Voice</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">J. Hoberman</ENAMEX>, "just a big, static snooze." The New
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">York Times</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Janet Maslin</ENAMEX>, on the other hand, says the "audaciously
beautiful imagery, captivating symmetries and brilliantly facile tricks" redeem
the film.

               , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wu-Tang Clan</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCA/Loud</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Critics</ENAMEX> predict that
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Staten Island</ENAMEX> rap <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX>-track double CD--released along with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wu-Wear</ENAMEX>,
a clothing line--will mark a breakthrough for hip-hop, as both hype and art.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wu-Tang Clan</ENAMEX> has entered the "stagnant hip-hop scene like a slap in the
face, parading its strikingly original gutter funk like a ghetto peacock" (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matt</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diehl, Entertainment Weekly</ENAMEX> ). <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Critics</ENAMEX> admire the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>'s eclectic
influences--including funk, flamenco, and psychedelic--and its lyrics, "as
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dense</ENAMEX>, obsessed, prolific and full of popular and arcane references as a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pynchon</ENAMEX> novel" (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neil Strauss</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> ). (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Clips</ENAMEX> are available

                  Without a Doubt
               , by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marcia Clark</ENAMEX>, with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Teresa Carpenter</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viking</ENAMEX>).
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Readers</ENAMEX> don't seem to mind that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O.J.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecutor</ENAMEX>'s angry memoir--a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">York Times</ENAMEX> No. 1 best seller--adds little to the vast body of literature
about the trial. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> do. "As her title suggests, self-reflection and an
appreciation of ambiguity are not <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marcia Clark</ENAMEX>'s strong points," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ellen Willis</ENAMEX>
writes in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times Book Review</ENAMEX> . The dead prose style, adds
Entertainment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Weekly</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dana Kennedy</ENAMEX>, "reads as if <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clark</ENAMEX> had dictated it
from her car phone." To the dismay of still others, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clark</ENAMEX> neither confirms nor
denies the rumor that she and fellow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecutor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher Darden</ENAMEX> slept
together.

            

               
                  <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Firewall: The Iran-Contra Conspiracy and Cover-Up</ENAMEX>

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walsh</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W.W. Norton</ENAMEX>). Too much minutiae, not enough revelations is the consensus
criticism of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Iran-Contra Special Prosecutor</ENAMEX>'s chronicle of his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven-year</TIMEX>
investigation. Wanting still to win the case, he rehashes arcane and forgotten
episodes from the Reagan-era scandal seemingly for his own benefit. "The leaden
account ... feels like it goes on for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven years</TIMEX>" (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacob Weisberg</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slate</ENAMEX>). Only <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Nation</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Doug Ireland</ENAMEX> finds merit in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walsh</ENAMEX>'s brief
against the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>, calling the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> "a genuine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hero</ENAMEX>."

            

               
                  <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Promiscuities: The Secret Struggle for Womanhood</ENAMEX>
               , by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Naomi Wolf</ENAMEX>
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Random House</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Third Wave feminist</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> book--part memoir, part
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sociology</ENAMEX>, part political tract--gets praised for its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lyrically</ENAMEX> rendered
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">anecdotes</ENAMEX> and slammed for shoddy thinking. The part about her sexual
coming-of-age in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> fares reasonably well. "[S]he melts together the
personal and political so gently we're barely aware of the difference," says
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laura Shapiro</ENAMEX>. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolf</ENAMEX>'s politics are roundly ridiculed,
especially her idea that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> should retreat to the wilderness with older
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> to perform ceremonial sex rites. "[S]he tries in vain to pass off tired
observations as radical aperçus, subjective musings as general truths, sappy
suggestions as useful ideas," writes the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> ' Michiko
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kakutani</ENAMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stearns</ENAMEX>, "with the inevitability and much of the monumentality of a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>
tragedy." <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Simon</ENAMEX>, the lone sniper, says the play deserved
