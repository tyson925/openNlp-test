            The cover
editorial advises the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.N. Security Council</ENAMEX> to be firm with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX>. If the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nations</ENAMEX> fails to enforce inspections here, when it has a clear mission and
broad <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">powers</ENAMEX>, its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">authority</ENAMEX> will be challenged in the future. Another editorial
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">urges Japan</ENAMEX> to legalize oral contraceptives. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> claims
that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pill</ENAMEX> is unsafe (it isn't), that it would quicken the spread of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX>
(it hasn't in other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>), and that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>'s falling birthrate must be
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">reversed</ENAMEX> (this doesn't justify an infringement on rights). What's the
government's real motive, according to the article? Abortions--which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japan</ENAMEX>
performs more of than any other industrialized <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>--are lucrative work for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX>. A story says cable television and the Internet haven't yet killed the
major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Networks</ENAMEX> still charge far higher ad rates than cable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>.
Keys to future network prosperity: They should produce their own shows, and
sculpt a recognizable identity (e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fox</ENAMEX> is "racy, edgy, young").

campaign to drain artificial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lake Powell</ENAMEX>, on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Utah</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arizona</ENAMEX> border, a
publicity stunt. Draining the lake would reveal the beautiful canyon
underneath, but destroy the ecosystem that thrives there now. Also, toxins that
have collected at the bottom of the lake would be exposed. A story says a new
genre of romance novels has found a popular hunk: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> romances

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek</ENAMEX> 's cover package is cautiously bullish, recommending a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>,
long-term investment strategy. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. News</ENAMEX> remains wary, doubting the chances for a continuing, multidecade boom.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> warns that recession might be imminent, caused by high consumer debt

<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">York City</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cop</ENAMEX> describes his life on the beat. Among the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cop</ENAMEX>'s observations: An
arrest is like a "blind date" (you spend <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> asking the perp personal
questions, then you hold his hands to fingerprint him), most police work
consists of "cheesy collars" for disorderly conduct and public urination, slum

a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client</ENAMEX> in order to duck a domestic-violence rap. A piece wonders whether
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Africa</ENAMEX>'s amnesty policy is worth it. The cops and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX> seeking
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">amnesty</ENAMEX> rarely tell the whole truth (they seldom admit to torture) and rarely
apologize to their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX>. "When you trade amnesty for truth, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">murderers</ENAMEX> get

some opera <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buffs</ENAMEX> nervous because they think he's castrated. He's not.
