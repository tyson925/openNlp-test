            As long as we're making of list of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who are not running for president
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</TIMEX>, I think we can safely add the names of all the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Nassau County</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> who got ousted from office <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</TIMEX>. I've been thinking how
amazing it is, after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nearly a century</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> rule here on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Long Island</ENAMEX>,
that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> finally got fed up enough to buck the system. These <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX>
were so well entrenched that they made <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mayor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Daley</ENAMEX>'s machine in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX>
look amateurish. What finally did them in was making a financial muck of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">county</ENAMEX>'s budget, getting the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">county</ENAMEX>'s bond rating downgraded, and proposing a
big <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">county</ENAMEX> tax increase <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX>.

            I've always thought that the history of the ascent--and now perhaps,
fall--of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nassau GOP</ENAMEX> would make a wonderful nonfiction book. Fraught with
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">intrigue</ENAMEX>, double-crossings, party <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> who went to jail, demands that loyal
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">followers</ENAMEX> tithe <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1 percent</NUMEX> of their salary to the system. I saw this quote this
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week</TIMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Long Island</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsday</ENAMEX> , in which a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GOP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">loyalist</ENAMEX> was
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">boasting</ENAMEX> publicly about how well organized a "machine" the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Republican Party</ENAMEX> was
in getting out the vote.

            I remember, when I used to cover <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">county</ENAMEX> politics for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsday</ENAMEX> , how
frustrating it was to run up against that implacable wall of united party
loyalty. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> used to hold these "informal" private meetings where
all the issues would be decided in a conference <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>. Then they would emerge to
take a "public" vote at meetings, often with little or no discussion of even
the most complicated topic. If anyone attending the public meeting raised a
question about this procedure, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> would react in shock--and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">belligerence</ENAMEX>--at the idea of being challenged.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> machine in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Nassau</ENAMEX> is a real throwback politically to the way
things used to be done routinely; the fact that it's survived so long is
amazing. It's like the political equivalent of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tribes</ENAMEX> of wholly
isolated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that explorers stumble on from time to time in the jungle. Over
the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, as the world around the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Nassau Republicans</ENAMEX> changed and got more
sophisticated and subtle, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GOP</ENAMEX> just hunkered down protecting a philosophy of
backroom business as usual.

            It will be interesting to see what happens when the county <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX>, a
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gulotta</ENAMEX>, who is widely credited with the budget fracas, comes
up for election next. He's enjoyed a comfortable <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decade</TIMEX> or more in office.
