            A little-discussed consequence of the pending calendar turn is the impact it
is likely to have on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the more hackneyed journalistic traditions: the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>-in-review survey.

            At most major news <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>, the advent of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the holiday season</TIMEX> means
that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX>, photo <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX>, and the like can kick back a little and set
about preparing stories, and sometimes whole broadcasts and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> issues,
dedicated to what happened during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the previous year</TIMEX>. Since the events in
question were already news once, retelling their stories involves little more
than scanning the clips and yanking some file photos--which is fortunate,
because there are <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hanukkah</ENAMEX> presents to buy, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> to attend,
and vacation destinations to get to.

            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">This year</TIMEX>, however, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalists</ENAMEX> are likely to spend <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the holiday season</TIMEX>
researching stories reviewing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the entire millennium</TIMEX> , or perhaps just the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">century</ENAMEX> , or (at the less-ambitious media <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outlets</ENAMEX>) <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the decade</TIMEX> , all
of which will end at the same moment. Hardly anyone, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chatterbox</ENAMEX> predicts, will
bother with the usual ritual of reviewing merely <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the previous 365 days</TIMEX>. There
may be some justification in this. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chatterbox</ENAMEX> thinks back on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>, what he
mostly remembers is everyone marveling at or fretting about or otherwise
thinking of the momentous significance of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the coming year</TIMEX>. But a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> reminds
Chatterbox that a few things did happen in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>. We fought an air war in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kosovo</ENAMEX>. There was a new Star Wars
movie. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Penfield Jackson</ENAMEX> issued findings of fact in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> antitrust case that
seemed to raise the possibility that the most powerful software <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> on
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">earth</ENAMEX> would be smashed into itty-bitty pieces. There was ...

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hmm</ENAMEX>. Chatterbox can't remember anything else.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Readers</ENAMEX> are invited to nominate events suitable for commemoration in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chatterbox</ENAMEX>'s "year in review" item, which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chatterbox</ENAMEX> would like to post
before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thanksgiving</TIMEX> (in order to beat all the various
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">century/millennium/decade</TIMEX>-in-review surveys). Best and worst movies, books, and
TV shows are also welcome, along with lists of the most significant obits of
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX>; and if anyone comes up with a list that has never been thought of
before, even better. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chatterbox</ENAMEX> will publish only the findings that he agrees
with. Please do not post nominations in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fray</ENAMEX>. Instead, please send them
to chatterbox@slate.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">com</ENAMEX>. Void
where prohibited by law. Cogito ergo sum . It's not the heat, it's the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">humidity</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La</ENAMEX> table mérite un detour . Gotta catch 'em all, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pokémon.</ENAMEX> Yo
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">quiero Taco Bell</ENAMEX> . The white <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">zone</ENAMEX> is for immediate loading and unloading of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> only. Etc.
