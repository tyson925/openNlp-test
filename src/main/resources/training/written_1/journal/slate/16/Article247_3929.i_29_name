            I was never one for watching sports on TV--as you know,
you never would have married me otherwise--but the older I get, the more I
enjoy it. OK, I admit, my main purpose in watching <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">baseball</ENAMEX> is I find it an
extremely effective way of falling asleep--far better than, say, golf, which at
least provides interesting scenery from time to time. But <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">football</ENAMEX>, there's a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">spectator</ENAMEX> sport that I really enjoy (though <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX>, with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jets</ENAMEX> flailing
so miserably, it has been painful, tragic, and somewhat dull).

            However, in my most unflinchingly honest moments, I
believe there is something else that draws me so inexorably to sports TV: The
commercials. Especially, as I've said to you more times than you care to
remember, the ads for online stuff. Is there anything funnier than that online brokerage ad that shows the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX>
with the purple hair teaching his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boss</ENAMEX> to make his first trade? No, not even
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Budweiser</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beer</ENAMEX> lizards. (Oh come on, you love them, too.) And what about
those over-the-top ads for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Outback</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX>, which showed wolverines being turned
loose on a marching <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX>? Or those great <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> e-business ads--I love those! The new one with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> sitting on a bench terrifying
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pigeons</ENAMEX> because he's shrieking into his cell phone while peering through a
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brazil</ENAMEX> -esque, crystalline eyeglass-mounted monitor
... I need one of those! I have to have one!

            Now comes the story in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this morning</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> about how online <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">retailers</ENAMEX> are going nuts this holiday
season, spending an unprecedented amount of dough buying TV ads. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Millions</NUMEX> and
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of dollars, a Saganesque amount of money. It's a great story. My
favorite example: eToys, which brought in a meager <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2 million</NUMEX> in sales during
its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">first year</TIMEX> of business, sold <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $24 million</NUMEX> worth of toys during
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year's fourth quarter</TIMEX> alone. Why? The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX>
says a TV ad showing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> clicking their way down their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> list to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santa</ENAMEX>
made the difference. Indeed, there's been a growing sense among online
e-tailers (and everyone else who advertises online) that banner ads simply
don't drive traffic. When I used to run the Netly
News and used to watch our ad traffic (and every other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">number</ENAMEX>) with daily
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">horror</ENAMEX>, I had a theory: That the vast majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who hit ad buttons ...
do so accidentally.

            I'm not alone, apparently. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last year</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 80</NUMEX>
percent of the money online sites spent in advertising was spent online; this
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> that money is being spent on TV and traditional advertising, the
Times says. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amazon</ENAMEX> is spending <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $100</NUMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">million</NUMEX> in old-style advertising this <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">holiday season</TIMEX> alone. This is a bad
trend, needless to say, for content sites like 
                  Slate
               . If <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> won't pay for
subscriptions and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">advertisers</ENAMEX> won't pay for banner ads, where does that leave
us?
