            As <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Russian</ENAMEX> bombs once again fall on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chechnya</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Armenia</ENAMEX> reels from the
assassination of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX>, the troubled <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caucasus</ENAMEX> region is back
in the news. Here's a brief backgrounder.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caucasus</ENAMEX> region encompasses <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 150,000 square miles</NUMEX> between
the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Black Sea</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caspian Sea</ENAMEX> in southeastern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. It includes the countries
of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Armenia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Azerbaijan</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Georgia</ENAMEX>, as well as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">republics</ENAMEX>. The
region is home to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> ethnic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> speaking at least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX>
languages. Occupied at different times by the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Persian</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hun</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottoman</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">empires</ENAMEX>, as well as enjoying infrequent self-rule, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caucasus</ENAMEX> was largely
conquered in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19 th century</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX>. Most of the region declared
independence after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Russian Revolution</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1917</TIMEX>, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> took
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1920-21</TIMEX> and integrated all of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caucasus</ENAMEX> into the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. When
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX> collapsed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Armenia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Azerbaijan</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Georgia</ENAMEX> regained
their independence while the northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">republics</ENAMEX> remained within <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX>.

            Although the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russians</ENAMEX> (and then <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviets</ENAMEX>) largely preserved the boundaries
that had evolved along ethnic lines, many minority <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> are now vying for
independence, while the established <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> are trying to preserve--or
expand--their borders. Like the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> itself, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caucasus</ENAMEX> has suffered
economically since the break up. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agriculture</ENAMEX> and petroleum--the area's biggest
industries--are now beginning to recover, but the region's estimated GDP
remains lower than it was during <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> rule.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Armenia</ENAMEX> (population <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.4 million</NUMEX>): With a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> that is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">90</NUMEX>
percent ethnic <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Armenian</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Armenia</ENAMEX> is the least diverse <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caucasus</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Armenian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">kingdom</ENAMEX> once encompassed much of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">present-day</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Turkey</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Georgia</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Syria</ENAMEX>; its more limited modern boundaries were established as part of the
settlement of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War I</ENAMEX>, which recognized the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> as independent (the
Bolsheviks, however, invaded soon thereafter). Since the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">th century</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">A.D.</ENAMEX>, it has been one of only a handful of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> in the region, and
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Armenian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Church</ENAMEX> has become central to national identity. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Armenians</ENAMEX>' desire
for independence from (and continued resentment of) the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.S.R.</ENAMEX> was caused in
part by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviets</ENAMEX>' persecution of church <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Armenia</ENAMEX> also has a standing
dispute with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Azerbaijan</ENAMEX> over the predominantly <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Armenian</ENAMEX> territory of
Nagorno-Karabakh, which the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviets</ENAMEX> gave to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Azerbaijan</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1922</TIMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> have observed a cease-fire since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX>, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">territory</ENAMEX>'s future
remains a central issue in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Armenian</ENAMEX> politics. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nationalists</ENAMEX> assassinated
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prime minister</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> others <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last month</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observers</ENAMEX> attributed the killings
to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Armenia</ENAMEX>'s continued economic plight and disagreements over how to deal with
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nagorno-Karabakh</ENAMEX>.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Azerbaijan</ENAMEX> (population <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.9 million</NUMEX>): <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Azerbaijan</ENAMEX>, the most
populous of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Caucasian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>, is the most strongly influenced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arab</ENAMEX>
cultures. It is a largely <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>, with a language similar to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Present-day Azerbaijan</ENAMEX> was born when <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> ceded the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">territory</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> after
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> wars in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 19 th century</TIMEX>. Azerbaijanis have long felt
oppressed by their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Armenian</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX> prevented
Azerbaijanis from reaping the full benefits of their oil industry. And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Soviet</ENAMEX>
persecution of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Azerbaijani</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nationals</ENAMEX> was harsh, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 120,000</NUMEX> suspected
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">subversives</ENAMEX> killed. The fight over <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nagorno-Karabakh</ENAMEX> (and resulting ethnic
violence) has left <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Azerbaijan</ENAMEX> divided: Virtually no ethnic <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Azerbaijanis</ENAMEX> live in
the disputed territory, and virtually none of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Azerbaijan</ENAMEX>'s ethnic <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Armenians</ENAMEX>
live outside it. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nagorno-Karabakh</ENAMEX> has voted for independence from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Azerbaijan</ENAMEX>,
but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> has refused to accept the decision.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Georgia</ENAMEX> (population <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.1 million</NUMEX>): <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Georgia</ENAMEX> is the most diverse
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Caucasian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>. The ethnic <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Georgian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">majority</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christian</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Georgian</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Orthodox</ENAMEX>) and speaks a language unrelated to any other in the world. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Russia</ENAMEX>
wrested the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> piecemeal from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1800s</TIMEX> and combined
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Georgia</ENAMEX> with the semi-autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abkhazia</ENAMEX> (in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Georgia</ENAMEX>'s northwest
corner), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ajara</ENAMEX> (in its southwest corner), and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Ossetia</ENAMEX> (in its
north-central <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX>). When <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Georgia</ENAMEX> became independent in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abkhazia</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Ossetia</ENAMEX>--each with its own ethnic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">majority</ENAMEX>--agitated for greater
autonomy, often clashing with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Georgian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX>. Although <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Georgia</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Constitution</ENAMEX> did not officially grant independence to these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">territories</ENAMEX>,
both are now essentially autonomous, and fighting has ended. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Georgia</ENAMEX>'s economy
has recovered faster than other former <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">republics</ENAMEX> due to its tourist trade (the
Black <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sea Coast</ENAMEX> has a warm climate) and its relative political stability.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chechnya</ENAMEX> (population <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">800,000</NUMEX>): <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chechnya</ENAMEX> has resisted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Russian</ENAMEX>
rule for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">over 400 years</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ethnic Chechens</ENAMEX>--<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">descendants</ENAMEX> of an isolated mountain
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>--were strong trade <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">18 th</NUMEX> and
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">19 th</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX>, but rebelled violently against annexation in the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late 1700s</TIMEX> and again in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1840s and 1850s</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Russia</ENAMEX> gained control of the
largely <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1859</TIMEX>. Under <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> control, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chechnya</ENAMEX> was united with
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">neighboring Ingushetia</ENAMEX> in a single <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">republic</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chechens</ENAMEX> objected to this
marriage, as well as to religious repression and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> attempts to force the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populace</ENAMEX> to work on collective <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">farms</ENAMEX>. Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chechnya</ENAMEX> announced its
independence before the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.S.R.</ENAMEX>'s collapse, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeltsin</ENAMEX> did not invade to stop
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">secession</ENAMEX> until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">At least 40,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> were killed in the ensuing war and
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300,000</NUMEX> fled. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1996</TIMEX> cease-fire, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sides</ENAMEX> agreed to leave <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chechnya</ENAMEX>'s
status unresolved until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> still claims <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chechnya</ENAMEX>, and the
international <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX> does not recognize its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> as independent.
