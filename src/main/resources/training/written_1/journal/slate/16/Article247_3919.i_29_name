            Conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commentators</ENAMEX> have taken to repeating the mantra that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Gore</ENAMEX>
introduced <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Willie Horton</ENAMEX>, the inflammatory racial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">symbol</ENAMEX> who enlivened the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX>
presidential race, to political debate in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Oct. 24</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Kristol</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> and publisher of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Weekly Standard</ENAMEX> , said on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">This Week :</ENAMEX>

            

               
                  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX>'s a mean, tough political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fighter</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> is the one who introduced
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Willie Horton</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> politics in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX> primary against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dukakis</ENAMEX>.
               

            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kristol</ENAMEX> repeated this, almost verbatim, in a "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Memo to Bill Bradley</ENAMEX>" that appeared in the issue of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek</ENAMEX> that hit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newsstands</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the following day</TIMEX>:

            

               
                  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Al</ENAMEX> can be a tough, mean <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">player</ENAMEX>. After all, he's the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> who
introduced <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Willie Horton</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> in his primary campaign against
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Dukakis</ENAMEX>.
               

            

            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Four days</TIMEX> after that, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Gigot</ENAMEX> wrote in his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Oct. 29</TIMEX> Wall Street
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal</ENAMEX> column:

            

               
                  Recall that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> who first raised the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prison</ENAMEX> furlough (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Willie</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Horton</ENAMEX>) issue against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike Dukakis</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX> wasn't <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Bush</ENAMEX>. It was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Al</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> .

            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Horton</ENAMEX>, you may recall, is a black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who, while doing prison time in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Massachusetts</ENAMEX> for murder, escaped from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a weekend</TIMEX> furlough and committed a
particularly brutal assault and rape. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dukakis</ENAMEX> hadn't started the state program
that allowed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prisoners</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Horton</ENAMEX>, who were serving life sentences without
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">parole</ENAMEX>, to take furloughs--that would have been <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dukakis</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> predecessor
as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Massachusetts</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis Sargent</ENAMEX>. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dukakis</ENAMEX>, even after hearing
what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Horton</ENAMEX> did on his furlough, was resistant to ending the program,
which the state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">legislature</ENAMEX> finally did after much crusading by a local
newspaper. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Horton</ENAMEX>'s story was subsequently offered up by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>'s campaign as evidence of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dukakis</ENAMEX>' softness on crime, and--less
directly--of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democratic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX>'s excessive fondness for black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. (It
was an ugly election.) Introducing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Willie Horton</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> political
discourse would not seem to be something to be proud of. Is it true that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX>
did so? And if it is true, was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX> campaign guilty of injecting cryptic
racist messages into the debate? The answers to these questions are,
respectively, yes and no.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> did ask <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dukakis</ENAMEX>, in a debate right before the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> primary,
about "<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekend</TIMEX> passes for convicted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">criminals</ENAMEX>." Here is how <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sidney Blumenthal</ENAMEX>,
now a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aide</ENAMEX> but then a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> , wrote it up <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few months later</TIMEX>:

            

               
                  An uncomfortable <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dukakis</ENAMEX>, after dispassionately reciting statistics,
conceded that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Massachusetts</ENAMEX> furlough program for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">murderers</ENAMEX> sentenced to
life imprisonment had been canceled .

               
                  The issue did not take for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX>, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> attracted the interest
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Pinkerton</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">research director</ENAMEX> for the then flailing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">campaign</ENAMEX>.
"That's the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time I paid attention," said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pinkerton</ENAMEX>. "I thought to myself,
'This is incredible' ...It totally fell into our lap."
               

            

            In reviewing this history, it's important to make some crucial distinctions.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> never mentioned that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Horton</ENAMEX> was black; indeed, he never mentioned <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Horton</ENAMEX>
by name. He merely drew attention, correctly, to the damaging fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dukakis</ENAMEX>
had tolerated a furlough program for especially violent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">criminals</ENAMEX> in his state
even after a horrific incident strongly suggested this was a bad policy. It's
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">conceivable</ENAMEX>, of course, that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> was warming up for more explicit and racially
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tinged</ENAMEX> use of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Horton</ENAMEX>'s story later in the primary fight. But that would have
been uncharacteristic of him. In any event, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> dropped out of the race
shortly after the debate.

            Now recall what the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> did with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Horton</ENAMEX>'s story: An "independent
expenditure" <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> aired an ad for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> showing a picture of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Horton</ENAMEX>. A
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> fund-raising letter in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maryland</ENAMEX> showed pictures of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dukakis</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Horton</ENAMEX> alongside the following text: "Is this your pro-family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX>?"
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Horton</ENAMEX> told <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Playboy</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX> that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> who identified herself
as working for "an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> affiliated with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">campaign</ENAMEX>" phoned him
and wrote letters to him up in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prison</ENAMEX> trying to get him to endorse <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dukakis</ENAMEX>. The
official <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">campaign</ENAMEX>, of course, kept its distance from such efforts, and
claimed to use <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Horton</ENAMEX> only in <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">race</ENAMEX>-neutral ways. But there is plenty of
evidence that it was heartily appreciative of the racial subtext. In his book
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about the 1988</TIMEX> campaign, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pledging Allegiance</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blumenthal</ENAMEX> quotes an
anonymous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">campaign team</ENAMEX> as saying, "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Willie Horton</ENAMEX> has star
quality. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Willie</ENAMEX>'s going to be politically furloughed to terrorize again. It's a
wonderful mix of liberalism and a big black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rapist</ENAMEX>." Although <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>'s campaign
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee Atwater</ENAMEX>, always insisted publicly that for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> campaign
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Horton</ENAMEX> was never a racial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">symbol</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atwater</ENAMEX> slipped in a speech he gave to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">southern</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> right before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that year</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democratic</ENAMEX> convention:

            

               
                  There is a story about a fellow named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Willie Horton</ENAMEX> who for all I know
may end up to be <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dukakis</ENAMEX>' running mate. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dukakis</ENAMEX> is making <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Hamlet</ENAMEX> look like the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">rock of Gibraltar</ENAMEX> in the way he's acted on this. [This was a reference to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dukakis</ENAMEX>' search for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice-</ENAMEX>presidential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX>.] The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> was on TV about
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a month ago</TIMEX> and he said you'll never see me standing in the driveway of my
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">house</ENAMEX> talking to these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX>. And guess what, on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX>, I saw in the
driveway of his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>? <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesse Jackson</ENAMEX>. So anyway, maybe he'll put this <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Willie</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Horton guy</ENAMEX> on the ticket after all is said and done.
               

            

            As was noted at the time by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Edsall</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> and
others, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atwater</ENAMEX> was pretty clearly equating <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesse Jackson</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Willie Horton</ENAMEX>
because both happened to be black. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> never did that. He never did anything
close to that.
