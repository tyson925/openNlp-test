            "Good <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> again, and happy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">St.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Crispin</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Day</ENAMEX> and
let's make a little history. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> I am ending my lifelong membership in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Party</ENAMEX> and my campaign for its nomination, and I'm declaring my
intention to seek the nomination of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reform Party</ENAMEX> for the presidency of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States of America</ENAMEX> ..."

            -- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pat Buchanan</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Oct. 25</TIMEX>
            

            And <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gentlemen</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX> now a-bed
Shall think themselves accursed they were not here,
And hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks
That fought with us upon <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saint Crispin</ENAMEX>'s day.

-- <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry V</ENAMEX>
            

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Act IV</ENAMEX>, Scene iii
            

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">English Camp</ENAMEX> .
            

            Enter the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">King</ENAMEX>.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">KING P.</ENAMEX>: If we are marked to die, our pitchfork'd <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">brigade</ENAMEX> is
enow
To do our <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> loss; and if to live,
The fewer ambassadorships to hand out.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">God's</ENAMEX> will! I pray thee, wish not one <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> more.
He which hath no stomach to this fight,
And hideth in the tall <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">grass</ENAMEX>, like a damn <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX>,
Let him depart; I'll get him a job at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNN</ENAMEX>,
Where mine appalling comments about the dusky Moor
And olive-skinned <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Levantine</ENAMEX> (and working maidens fair,
And--no one's really glommed onto this yet--
My disparagement of those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> of right good male fellowship,
Who doth hoard original-cast albums of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Broadway</ENAMEX> musicals,
If ya know what I mean) serves but to raise my fees on <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Crossfire</ENAMEX> .
Forsooth, 'tis a rich scam!
We would not die in that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>'s company
Who would not punch out <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Georgetown</ENAMEX> cops
When pulled over for speeding.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">This day</TIMEX> is called the feast of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crispian</ENAMEX>:
He that outlives this day, and doth come over the hill,
Will buy a round when <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> is named,
And rouse him at the name of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crispian</ENAMEX>.
He that shall live this day, and see old age,
Will bore his <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">neighbours</ENAMEX> unto death,
With tales of when and how
The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Old Man</ENAMEX> (that's me!--not Pop, not <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX>, not <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX>!)
Did flip the bird to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GOP</ENAMEX>!
We few, we happy <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jew</ENAMEX>--(whoops;
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yon Wall Street Shylocks</ENAMEX> won't soon forget that slip),
We <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">band</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brothers</ENAMEX>;
(<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Uh</ENAMEX>, no, not you, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hank</ENAMEX>. Put the gun down)
For he to-day that sheds his blood with me
Shall be my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX>; be he ne'er so vile;
And <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lord</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ventura</ENAMEX> (who doth speak ill of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Faith</ENAMEX>)
Shall hold his manhood cheap
That he did not mind his tongue
And endorse me.
He could have had the veep slot,
Stupid putz.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Exeunt</ENAMEX>.
