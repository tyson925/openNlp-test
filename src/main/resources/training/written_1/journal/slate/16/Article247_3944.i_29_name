            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Dear Lisa</ENAMEX>--

            I think it is silly to think of a backlash against a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> who has, to date,
sold <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">no more than 25,000</NUMEX> copies of any of her books. There are a lot of better
things to put energy into than chopping down the work of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> who worked at
the trade honorably and industriously for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>-odd <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> without getting any of
the recognition many of us believe she richly deserved. Why don't her supposed
detractors go beat up on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Disney</ENAMEX> for a while?

            My attitude toward any backlash is that those of us who love <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Powell</ENAMEX> have her
now--<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 15</NUMEX> books in print--and those who don't can simply avoid her, the way,
say, that I avoid <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allen Ginsberg</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walt Whitman</ENAMEX>. I know <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who are deeply
moved by both of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX>--and more power to them--but they're simply not
for me. Different strokes and all that. The world is full of a number of things
...

            My own obscure <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">favorites</ENAMEX> include the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> books of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Honor Tracy</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Irish</ENAMEX>-born
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">satirist</ENAMEX> who makes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Evelyn Waugh</ENAMEX>'s work taste like the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk</ENAMEX> of human kindness),
the dark early writing of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigrid Undset</ENAMEX> (before her religious conversion, which
radically changed her style), and the best novels of manners by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">John</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marquand</ENAMEX>--all of which are largely unknown to contemporary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX>
(particularly young ones). Who else has created such a splendid "unreliable
narrator" as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Horatio Willing</ENAMEX>, the pompous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ass</ENAMEX> who "narrates" <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Marquand's The</ENAMEX>
Late <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Apley</ENAMEX> ?

            I enjoy literary biography but don't think that it is essential to enjoyment
of the work. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gustav Mahler</ENAMEX> gave titles to every movement in his <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">100-minute</TIMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Symphony No. 3</ENAMEX>, then took them all out, saying that no work of art was any good
unless it could stand on its own. I suppose that is true--although I confess an
occasional difficulty with important <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> whose personalities repel me.
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rousseau</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brecht</ENAMEX> will do for starters; for me, they reek of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">totalitarianism</ENAMEX>. But would I feel that way if I didn't know their life stories?
Probably.)

            Still, I do think that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Powell</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personality</ENAMEX> has had a lot to do with
her revival. For those of us who love her, she seems a wise, funny,
unpretentious, and compassionate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX>, one blessed with a decidedly wicked
sense of humor. We like her <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>. She seems smart and civilized. She never
lectures us; she is never a scold or an "uplifter"; she never exalts some
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mythical Humanity</ENAMEX> over the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day-to-day</TIMEX> struggles of ordinary human beings, who
are all, of course, making the same mistakes over and over again. As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">W. Jackson</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bate</ENAMEX>--my choice for the ultimate literary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biographer</ENAMEX> of our time--wrote of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samuel Johnson</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Powell</ENAMEX>'s work would allow us to construct a vastly pessimistic
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vision</ENAMEX> of the human condition. And yet we leave her with gratitude and cheer,
with the sense that somebody has understood us--and, much of the time,
had a little fun with us, too.

            To sum up--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Powell</ENAMEX> may never be for everybody, but she is one of those
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> who will always be very much for some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. I don't find her any more
dated than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Petronius</ENAMEX>: With either <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>, you have but to play around with the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">settings</ENAMEX> and circumstances a little and you have what <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mad</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> used
to call "the usual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gang</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">idiots</ENAMEX>" gloriously presented with a calm, amused,
but unsparing eye. May the frolic continue.

            It's been a pleasure getting to know you (in this distinctly '90s fashion),
and I look forward to kicking this whole matter around over a bottle of wine
some day. Good luck in all you do--and thanks for what you've already done for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dawn Powell</ENAMEX>.

            Warmest,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tim</ENAMEX>
