               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wired News</ENAMEX> had an unsettling story this
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">morning</ENAMEX>: A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Washington</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researcher</ENAMEX> has found that cell phones
appear to cause long-term-memory loss in laboratory <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX>. Yes, yes, I know what
you're going to ask--what are lab rats doing talking on the phone? Actually,
it's even weirder than that. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Lai</ENAMEX>, a research <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bioengineering</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Seattle</ENAMEX>, first put <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> into a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tank</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> and "taught
them to swim to a platform in the middle of the tank," <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WN</ENAMEX> reports.
(How do you teach <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> to swim? You start with teensy-tiny water wings, I
guess.) Then, after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> knew the route, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lai</ENAMEX> confused them by dumping
powdered <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk</ENAMEX> into the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, making it harder to navigate--the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> had to
make it to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platform</ENAMEX> by memory, rather than by sight. Finally, after the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">long-suffering rodents</ENAMEX> had learned the route, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lai</ENAMEX> bombarded half the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> with
microwaves similar to the kind that's emitted from mobile phones. Not
surprisingly, the poor rats couldn't remember the way to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platform</ENAMEX> after
that. It got even worse when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lai</ENAMEX> removed the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platform</ENAMEX>: The unbombarded rats
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">swam</ENAMEX> to the place where it should be and looked around with concern; the
cellular rats just swam around randomly, like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Royal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> at
the beach.

            I could see this one really upsetting the digerati. For
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have shrugged off suggestions that cell phones could cause
certain kinds of tumors. (I was interviewing an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineer</ENAMEX> recently who referred
to GSM phones as "brain fryers"--he laughed when he said that.) A link between
cell-phone use and brain <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> ... big deal. It's only death. But a suggestion
that cell-phone use makes us dumber? That could be serious trouble for the
cell-phone industry.

            Of course, it's impossible to say at this point if the
results from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lai</ENAMEX>'s experiment will extrapolate to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>. Other research will
need to be conducted (rats in a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tank</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">juice</ENAMEX>, I guess, followed by a vat of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">beer</ENAMEX>). Also, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wired</ENAMEX> says the radio transmissions are slightly different
from the type used by cellular phones. Still, I figured that you, as president
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cell Phone Haters Club</ENAMEX>, would want to be aware of this
development so you can disseminate it (how? Carrier pigeon?) to your
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>.
