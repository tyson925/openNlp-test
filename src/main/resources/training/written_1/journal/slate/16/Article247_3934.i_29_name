            I would like to change the subject to <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">elephant dung</ENAMEX>. Big surprise that a
federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> flung some (metaphorically) at <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mayor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giuliani</ENAMEX> and ordered him to
stop harassing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brooklyn Museum</ENAMEX>'s fabulous exhibit of body parts and other
really important art. I only wish this strong defense of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First</ENAMEX>
Amendment rights had come a little earlier, before the whole issue got muddied
up by the disclosure that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> were bankrolling the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">elephant</ENAMEX>-dung
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">virgin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX>, by soliciting money from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who stand to profit by its
display. At least I think that's what the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> did; the financial shenanigans
are getting as hard to follow as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whitewater</ENAMEX>.

            In any case, the main thing that the whole flap settled for me was this
question: Who should I vote for in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> race? I was waffling, you
know, even though I consider myself a good <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrat</ENAMEX>, because the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clintons</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al.</ENAMEX>, have become such tasteless parodies of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> that I was doubting
whether I could pull the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lever for Hill</ENAMEX>. (I call her <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hill</ENAMEX>, because she clearly
wants to be my best <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX>, what with moving to a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York City</ENAMEX> suburb to show
that she's just like me and all.) I almost could have seen myself voting for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giuliani</ENAMEX>, sending him to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> where within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a week</TIMEX> he would get all the
homeless <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> off the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>, start a nationwide campaign to ticket (or
perhaps <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cane</ENAMEX>?) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">jaywalkers</ENAMEX> in front of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smithsonian</ENAMEX>, and assign the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Capitol</ENAMEX>
security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guards</ENAMEX> to walk neighborhood beats to build up, uh, empathy for the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> they encounter.

            But then he pulls this: trying to yank a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>'s funding because he doesn't
like a picture that's going to be hung on the wall. Here is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who is
running for the job of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawmaker</ENAMEX> who clearly has not read one single law ever
written in this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. Con<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">-sti-tu-tion</NUMEX>. Sound it out, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>. Here is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> who relishes the act of taking patently illegal and morally repulsive
stands. Would this not embarrass me and the other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> from this great state
of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>? I can just see him trying to pass laws requiring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> to have crew
cuts (or whatever nutty thing he wants to impose on the world next). I would
like to think that his nutty <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> stunt was past of his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> campaign, an
attempt to appeal to the ... I don't know, the pro-censorship vote? That's
probably a huge demographic. But don't they have enough <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> to choose
among already?
