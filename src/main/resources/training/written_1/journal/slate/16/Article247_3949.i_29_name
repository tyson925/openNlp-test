            No one has told the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> editorial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX>, to be
sure, but pushing for tax cuts has become the political equivalent of flogging
that proverbial dead horse. Congressional <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> watched their proposed
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$793 billion</NUMEX> tax cut disappear from sight without much of a fight. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Forbes</ENAMEX>
is the only presidential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> still banging the flat-tax drum, and even he
has reinvented himself as a social <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conservative</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Earlier this summer</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alan</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspan</ENAMEX> notoriously--at least for those on the right--said he'd rather see a
budget surplus go toward paying down the debt than toward a major tax cut. And
most polls show that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> ranks lower taxes low on the totem
pole of priorities for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>.

            It's true that if you frame poll questions about taxes differently, you get
different responses. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspan</ENAMEX> did say he would prefer a tax cut to more
government spending, and it's safe to assume that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Republican Party</ENAMEX> platform
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> will call for a significant tax cut. But that call sounds increasingly
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hollow</ENAMEX>, at least from an intellectual perspective, and the reason is not just
that bringing the budget into balance (via, in no small part, the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX> tax
increase) has proved to have pleasant side effects for the economy. Even more
important is the fact that much of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reaganite</ENAMEX> case for tax cutting depended
on the harsh reality of life in an inflationary economy.

            Supply-siders have now become among the most ardent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocates</ENAMEX> of the idea
that inflation is dead, and that therefore the economy can safely grow much
faster than it has in the past. But they don't appear to have considered what
the death of inflation might mean for their tax-cutting fervor.

            In <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Wealth and Poverty</ENAMEX> , for instance, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Gilder</ENAMEX> made the impact of
inflation central to his emphasis on tax-cutting. Effectively calling for an
end to the capital-gains tax, he wrote, "With a rate of inflation over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>
percent, a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 percent</NUMEX> tax on capital gains quickly rises above <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100 percent</NUMEX> in
its average impact on assets held <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than a few years</TIMEX>." Contrasting the
situation of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late 1970s</TIMEX> with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that of the early 1960s</TIMEX>, when top marginal
rates on income and capital gains ranged <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as high as 91 percent</NUMEX>, he noted that
"the real tax rate is far higher, not lower, than it was during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the days</TIMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kennedy</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Camelot</ENAMEX>. ... The real tax was not <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70 percent</NUMEX>, but <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70 percent</NUMEX> of a
nominal amount of earnings that was mostly inflation, combined with a decline
in the value of principal equal to the rate of inflation."

            What <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gilder</ENAMEX> was pointing to here was in fact important. Because tax brackets
and capital gains are not indexed, the combination of rapid inflation and high
taxes ends up eating away most real gains. It works something like compound
interest in reverse. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1970s</TIMEX>, just staying ahead of the game took a lot of
effort.

            The really important blow against this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of affairs was not the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reagan</ENAMEX>
tax cuts but rather <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Volcker</ENAMEX>'s interest-rate hikes, which ended
double-digit inflation. And in any case, the reduction of the capital-gains tax
on long-term investments to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 percent</NUMEX> had already happened (in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1978</TIMEX>) by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time Wealth</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Poverty</ENAMEX> was published. Regardless, though, there was
something to the idea that in a time of high inflation, high marginal tax rates
acted as a disincentive to both investment and labor.

            But we don't live in a time of high inflation anymore. Actually, we don't
seem to live in a time of inflation at all. And with a rate of inflation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
percent or so, a capital-gains tax of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 percent</NUMEX> has an average impact on
assets of about, well, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 percent</NUMEX>. And if you look at the trading volume on
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> stock exchanges, it's pretty clear that the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">39.8 percent</NUMEX> rate on
short-term gains isn't keeping too many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> from investing. As for bracket
creep, I'm not sure anyone even remembers what that is. Which doesn't mean that
we need to go back to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1979</TIMEX>. But it does mean that, from an economic perspective
at least, ardent tax-cutters need to come up with a new idea. Perhaps they
could call it the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post-Inflation Paradigm</ENAMEX>.
