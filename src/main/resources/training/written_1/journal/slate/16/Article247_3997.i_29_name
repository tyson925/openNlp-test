            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dear Todd</ENAMEX>,

            Good <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> to you. With regard to your comment about "self-hating
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">depressives</ENAMEX> who don't get out of bed until <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">noon</TIMEX>," I have quite the opposite
problem. Recently I have been the victim of a team action by my <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> to
move their <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning meal from 7:00 to 6:15</TIMEX>. It used to take place at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>. Next
thing I knew it was <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:30</TIMEX>. Then <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>. Then <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">7:45</TIMEX>. I think they think that if they
keep moving the mealtime <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> and earlier they will hit some kind of a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">quantum</ENAMEX> physics time-space continuum where there will be a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24-hour</TIMEX> mealtime
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">loop</ENAMEX>.

            I have been sitting here waiting to begin this e-mail exchange like I am
preparing to take the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SATs</ENAMEX> again. The only other time I ever intentionally
perused this many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX> out of sheer <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">anxiety</ENAMEX> was during my <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one-year</TIMEX> stint
as a radio talk-show <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX>. Ultimately, there was precious little reason to use
any of the information in that format either. But oh, the things I have
learned. For instance, I read in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA Today</ENAMEX> online that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actress</ENAMEX>/rap star
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brandy Norwood</ENAMEX>, who plays the college-age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">star</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TV</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moesha</ENAMEX> , caused
her show to go on hiatus when she was hospitalized for dehydration. Like so
many TV shows, I'll bet they use this unfortunate opportunity to create a
special episode of the series that will finally aim a much needed spotlight on
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the most overlooked problems facing college <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> today. We hear so
much about excessive drinking on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">campus</ENAMEX>, but so little is ever said about all
the dehydrated young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who refuse all beverages entirely.

            I don't know anything about that screeching-<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX>-type <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> music you
mentioned, but in a geographically related story, I learned in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">L.A.</ENAMEX>
Times that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">75 percent</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>-in-waiting are breaking with
traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asian</ENAMEX> thought and are hoping to have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby girls</ENAMEX>. The timing
couldn't be better for this female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> boom because in our <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> at
last a military advisory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committee</ENAMEX> has opened up a debate that will eventually
pave the way for a world of the future in which every little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> will finally
be able to pursue her cherished childhood dream--to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX> live and work on a
nuclear powered <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">submarine</ENAMEX>.

            And speaking of mildly feminist issues, can I use this as a segue to discuss
just briefly how truly repelled and filled with hatred I am for theoretical
presidential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Trump</ENAMEX>? It's not just the arrogance and the smug
expression, although that helps things along, I admit. But I have been enraged
at his repeated comment about how if <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> had conducted his affair with a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">supermodel</ENAMEX> instead of a tubby intern he would have been regarded as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hero</ENAMEX>. And
then he always finishes this up with a comment about how his weakness is that
he (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trump</ENAMEX>) doesn't smoke or drink but dammit, he "loves <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>." <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX> of all,
let me say that I never imagined myself having a reason to defend the mainly
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pathetic</ENAMEX> and ridiculous Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX>, but I wonder if the vile and loathsome
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trump</ENAMEX> has ever had a conversation with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> who wasn't a genetic anomaly
(or supermodel, as he calls them). That to me is like a caviar <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">collector</ENAMEX> saying
that he really likes <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX>. OK, I know that analogy doesn't really work. Maybe
you can help me with a new one. I have been looking for a better analogy for
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks now</TIMEX>. As for that earnest young death-of-irony <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX>, I read only his book
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">review</ENAMEX>, not his book. But I hope I don't run in to him in a dark alley
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">someplace</ENAMEX> because I have been taking self-defense classes and I might just yell
out "Heelpalm!" and then we'll both have to live with the consequences.

            I guess you must know that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> is the birthday of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ODB</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Old Dirty Bastard</ENAMEX>)
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Wu-Tang Clan</ENAMEX>. He turns <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX>. Did you get him anything?
