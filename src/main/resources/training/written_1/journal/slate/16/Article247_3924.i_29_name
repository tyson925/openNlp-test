            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Encyclopedia Britannica</ENAMEX> was the definitive old-economy media <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>. It was
ponderous, authoritative, and dedicated to the proposition that the world was
changing slowly enough that giant tomes were the perfect vehicle for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">communicating</ENAMEX> information about it. And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Britannica</ENAMEX>'s experiences with new
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">technologies</ENAMEX>, beginning with the CD-ROM and then extending to the Internet,
have done nothing to dispel its old-economy image. The problem is that now
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Britannica</ENAMEX> is trying to play in the new economy. At every turn, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Britannica</ENAMEX> has
reacted slowly, incompletely, and in almost blissful ignorance of the economics
of the Web.

            But what's important about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Britannica</ENAMEX>'s most recent screw-up--it opened its
revamped Web site for business <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks ago</TIMEX> and then immediately shut it down
because the sheer volume of traffic crashed the site--is not just that it shows
how ill-equipped to deal with the Internet most big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> remain. It also
shows that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Britannica</ENAMEX>'s reputation carries enormous weight in the online world.
The site crashed, after all, because <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">tens of millions</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> tried to access
the encyclopedia online. And that has interesting implications for the way we
think about offline brands and their extension onto the Internet.

            First, though, the bad news. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Britannica</ENAMEX>'s performance in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1990s</TIMEX> has been
an object lesson in what not to do. Because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> thought its brand name
was irresistible, it brushed off the challenge posed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>'s Encarta
CD-ROM encyclopedia, and when it first introduced the CD-ROM version of its own
encyclopedia, it priced it so high that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Encarta</ENAMEX> was essentially handed the
market. There are now <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who use CD-ROM encyclopedias, and
almost none of them have bought <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Britannica</ENAMEX> in book form.

            You could argue that those are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Britannica</ENAMEX> couldn't have pursued
without endangering its core franchise. But as the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last few years</TIMEX> have
demonstrated, the endangering was going to take place whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Britannica</ENAMEX>
pursued them or not. And had <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Britannica</ENAMEX> approached the CD-ROM market seriously,
it could have snared a huge chunk of it. Or so, at least, its recent (if
short-lived) performance on the Internet suggests.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Web</ENAMEX>-site disaster similarly speaks to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Britannica</ENAMEX>'s continued struggle to
adapt to new technology. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> has actually been online since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX>,
offering fee-based research, but the revamping marked <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Britannica</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">acknowledgement</ENAMEX> (one we 
                  Slate
               sters are very familiar with) that
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Web</ENAMEX> and fees don't go together well, and its hope that its brand was
powerful enough to make an advertising business work. (As has been the case
with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yahoo</ENAMEX>.) Making that conceptual shift was important. But so was doing the
back-end work that would keep <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> happy. And here <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Britannica</ENAMEX> fell short
again.

            This may very well mean that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Britannica</ENAMEX> won't ever really figure out how to
capitalize on the Internet, since technology isn't going to stop changing and
any successful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> will have to make adaptability a core competence (at
Britannica right now, it's not even a marginal competence). But the fact that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tens</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> wanted to use the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britannica</ENAMEX> Web site makes up for a
lot of mistakes. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A few weeks ago</TIMEX>, at a conference organized by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michael</ENAMEX>
Mauboussin of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Credit Suisse First Boston</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Disney Imagineer Danny Hillis</ENAMEX> said
that he thought <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Britannica</ENAMEX>'s brand was so strong that once it got its act
together, it would be a Web <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">powerhouse</ENAMEX>. At the time, I thought he was
incredibly wrong, both about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Britannica</ENAMEX>'s brand name and about its future on
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Web</ENAMEX>. But oddly, after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last two weeks</TIMEX>, it looks more and more like
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hillis</ENAMEX> might very well be right.
