            Are you sure <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Barksdale</ENAMEX> isn't running for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>? If he reconsiders, I
would probably vote for him. Unless you run. I would always vote for you. But I
hope your <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platform</ENAMEX> would be broader than Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ventura</ENAMEX>'s. Don't limit your
reincarnation goals to returning as a brassiere. You could be any piece of
underwear you want. Really. All you have to do is dream.

            I myself am planning to return to life as the new computer printer that you
bought and installed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX>. (I use the word "installed" rather loosely,
considering that the damn thing crashes every time you try to print a Word
document and will not allow you to print anything in "best mode"--a euphemism
for the really really slow mode that you have to invoke if you actually will
need to subsequently read whatever you printed out.) See, if I were a computer
printer--or any other piece of electronic equipment, actually--then I wouldn't
really have to do what I was supposed to do. I could "conflict" with other
"devices" constantly and it wouldn't be my responsibility to reconcile the
problem. It would be yours. I could arrive without "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USB</ENAMEX> cable" and it would be
up to you to run out to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX> to get some to fix me. (While you're there,
pick up a pint of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Haagen Dazs</ENAMEX>, as well.) I could look really cheesy and cheap
and have the phrase "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Professional Series</ENAMEX>" written across my front in a font
that was perhaps modern looking back in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1970s</TIMEX>. In short, if I were
reincarnated as our new computer printer, I could take comfort in knowing that
I was state-of-the-art technology.

            How much did we pay for that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">printer</ENAMEX>? I notice from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s paper that our
printer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX>'s stock went up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 and an eighth</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX>. We should stop
buying the printers, just buy the stock.

            I know, I know, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">printer</ENAMEX> nightmare is all just a glitch, and you'll fix
it over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the weekend</TIMEX> and it will only take <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20 hours</TIMEX> of your time and as a result
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">printer</ENAMEX> all the computers and appliances in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> will crash and
have to be rebooted and reinstalled and reconfigured and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one or two</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX>
who are too close to the power source will get electrocuted, but then by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX>
... we'll be able to print out a Word document.

            How much did we pay for that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">printer</ENAMEX>?
