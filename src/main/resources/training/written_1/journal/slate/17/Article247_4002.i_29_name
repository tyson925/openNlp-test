            You might have thought the biggest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">winner</ENAMEX> on Wall Street in the wake of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>'s agreement on terms for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> to enter the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Trade</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Organization</ENAMEX> would have been the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> that's been loudest in its support for
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> entry, namely <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX>. But in what may be yet another sign of the advent
of an economy based on bits and not atoms--or at least of the mainstream
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">acceptance</ENAMEX> of the idea of that economy--the biggest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">winner</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, by
far, was (what a shock!) an Internet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX>-language content provider
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX>'s shares rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">75 percent</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> on news of the accord, raising the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>'s market cap to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2 billion</NUMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX> went public as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nasdaq</ENAMEX> stock--meaning that its actual shares
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trade</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nasdaq</ENAMEX>, as opposed to what are called <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> depositary
receipts--in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July</TIMEX>, and its shares have now risen more than fourfold. The leap
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> was prompted by one of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>'s key concessions to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, to
allow foreign equity investment--<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">up to 50 percent</NUMEX>--in both <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX>-owned
telecommunications <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> and Internet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>. This was a pretty
significant about-face, considering that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">just two months ago</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chinese</ENAMEX>
government took a public stand against foreign involvement in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chinese</ENAMEX>
Internet industry, and that many thought that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> would draw a line
around the Net, even if it conceded on telecom. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX>'s concessions open the
door to myriad <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partnerships</ENAMEX>--how far off can AOL <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> be?--and the idea seems
to be that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX> has a key foothold in the market.

            When you consider that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 750,000</NUMEX> registered <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> in a
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than a billion</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, calling its foothold "key" seems rather
dubious. But the truth is that it's next to impossible to think about business
in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> in free-market terms. In a real market, brands are vulnerable, and
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-mover advantages--like the ones that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Compuserve</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prodigy</ENAMEX> had in
Internet access in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, for example--can be lost as a result of
competition. But in a market in which political connections remain essential
and state intervention can come at any time, a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-mover advantage, insofar
as it seems to reflect state sanction, if not support, appears to be rather
more significant.

            The paradox inherent in all of this, of course, is that the Internet really
is an incredibly destabilizing technology, both economically and politically,
and yet the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> is doing its best to hold it fixed, even though
holding it fixed (if that's possible) is the best way to destroy its value. The
viral spread of information on the Internet, the incredibly rapid and
inexpensive growth of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user communities</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX>, the facilitation of
global market relationships: These are the hallmarks of the Net--not merely in
the minds of the digerati but also in the minds of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX>. They're the only
things that make a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yahoo</ENAMEX> worth <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$50 billion</NUMEX> or a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> like
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX> worth <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2 billion</NUMEX>. Yet these are the things--even after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">accord</ENAMEX>--for which the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> has very little affection.

            The romantic idea is that the combination of real free trade, the Internet,
and modern telecommunications will eventually bring down the hidebound
political and economic structures that still rule <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>. Now, the romantic idea
may be right, and greater access to the Net and greater free trade are
certainly good things. But the truth, banal as it may seem, is that we still
don't really know very much about how the potentially democratizing Internet
really functions in a thoroughly undemocratic society, just as we don't really
know very much about how the market-revolutionizing Internet functions in a
non-capitalist economy. Obviously, if the romantic idea is right, the upside is
so immense that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$750 million</NUMEX> rise in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX>'s market cap will be a
mere drop in the bucket. But in a way the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>'s name is the perfect
conjoining of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> words--<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> and .<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">com</ENAMEX>--whose real value lies not in what is
but only (always?) in what may be.
