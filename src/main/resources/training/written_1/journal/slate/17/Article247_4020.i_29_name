            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dear Merrill</ENAMEX>,

            What do you mean? The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">L.A.</ENAMEX> equivalent of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Post</ENAMEX> is just
the whole <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> itself.

            I actually saw the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> show <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ricky Martin</ENAMEX> concert, not because I was
awake for it (of course) but on a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Denver</ENAMEX> local newscast when I was visiting my
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mom</ENAMEX>. They kept saying, "And coming up, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ricky Martin</ENAMEX> mania!" or whatever, like
it was a news item, and I'm sitting there thinking "ah, the sad state of
journalism"-type thoughts, but I didn't know the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of it because then so
anyway when they finally got to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX>, they actually rebroadcast the
whole show, not just clips or highlights, but the whole thing in its
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">entirety</ENAMEX>! I mean, what the hell is that? Afterwards, they cut back to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">anchorwoman</ENAMEX> and she's trading quips with the other newscaster and fanning
herself in that <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Hand-Gesture That Wouldn't Raise an Eyebrow in the Middle of</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> Services way that very, very middle-aged, very, very white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> do to
indicate that they have become sexually aroused. The noble <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> estate!

            An equivalent would be when papers run giant articles reporting the content
of an upcoming <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">60-second</TIMEX> campaign ad. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX>'s was in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> ,
on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX>'s first big promo spot, in which, because he drafted a bill to allow
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> to remain hospitalized for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">48 hours</TIMEX> after delivering a newborn, a woman
claims that "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thanks to Bill Bradley</ENAMEX>, my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> is alive <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>." It turns out
that her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX> was born before the bill was ratified, but the explanation
offered was that the bill's postpartum passage gave her the confidence she
needed to have another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX>, later. Now, as a carbon-based life form, my
cells require regular fluid intake to survive. Yet, somehow I don't see myself
ever earnestly emoting to a camera "Thanks to public-works <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pioneer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thurmond</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elias Plefko</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madison</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commissioner</ENAMEX> of waterworks from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1834 to 1872</TIMEX>, who
installed my <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>'s water system, I am alive <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>," although technically I
suppose its sort of true.

            Speaking of public works, while I have no idea what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dick Riordan</ENAMEX> ate for
lunch, I can tell you what's in his toilet bowl even as we speak: <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nature</ENAMEX>, in her wisdom, intended to be <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">thousands of miles</NUMEX> away from him. Since
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L.A.</ENAMEX> is a savage desert hellscape not fit for human life, it has to suck its
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lifeblood</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scream</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Blacula</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Scream</ENAMEX> -style, from the whole western <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of
the continent. No <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">offense</ENAMEX>, some of my best <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Angelenos</ENAMEX> (because they
are comedy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX>, and there is an unwritten law saying anyone who writes
comedy has to live in a sprawling array of car phones and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-story <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>
stretching <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">hundreds of miles</NUMEX> in every direction), and besides, any <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> that
can come up with Being <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Malkovich</ENAMEX> , which is, in addition to being a
nice metaphor for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary Clinton</ENAMEX>'s identity-shifting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> bid (as well as,
well, her whole existence), quite possibly the greatest movie ever made,
deserves nothing but admiration.

            I've heard An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Movie</ENAMEX> is fabtastic and I'll see it tonight so
I can discuss it with you <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX>.

            By the way, I see now that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mahir</ENAMEX> has made <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time magazine</ENAMEX>! Look on his
works, ye mighty, and despair!

            Gee this is fun,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Todd</ENAMEX>

            P.S.: I should probably add somewhere in here that my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> is a wonderful
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> and I love her very much.
