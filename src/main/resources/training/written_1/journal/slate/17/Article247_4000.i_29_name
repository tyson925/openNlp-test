            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dear Todd</ENAMEX> ...

            I feel like we are really starting to bond now. I, too, have never seen an
episode of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moesha</ENAMEX> , and even more amazing, I have never even read a TV
Guide description of an episode.

            However, I think you will be impressed when you learn that I was actually
planning to attend the opening <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekend</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pok√©mon</ENAMEX>: The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Movie</ENAMEX> so I
could discuss it with you here. Although I have never seen that TV show either,
I have been regularly purchasing assorted <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pok√©mon</ENAMEX> merchandise for my <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> crazy
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nephews</ENAMEX>. But then it began to occur to me that if I showed up alone at a public
screening of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pok√©mon</ENAMEX> , I would soon begin to notice the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> hugging their young ones close to them as they eyed me with horror and
suspicion. I began to rehearse excuses about where my absent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX> might be."
He's ... uh ... in the lobby returning phone calls." Then it dawned on me that
there could well be some kind of a city ordinance against a lone adult
attending a screening of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pok√</ENAMEX>©mon unaccompanied by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>. So, sadly, I
never went. However I could not fail to notice that in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s paper we learn
that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pok√©mon</ENAMEX> movie was "the highest grossing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> premiere of
any film to open in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November</TIMEX>." Now that is an accolade to be proud of.
This whole tradition of being really, really specific in the details of the
honor you are bestowing is a trend I applaud and would like to see expand. I
wonder what the highest grossing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX> premiere in a month ending with an R
during a <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World Series</ENAMEX> playoff game was? And what would be wrong with a category
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Academy Awards</ENAMEX> for "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Best Actress in a Top-10 Christmas Film That Opened</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Between Thanksgiving</TIMEX> and the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">15 th</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December</TIMEX>"?

            Before I get off the topic of show business, I also noticed a lot of items
about the questionable ratings of the new <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin</ENAMEX> Short talk show. King World
executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andy Friendly</ENAMEX> is quoted as saying, "We've lightened up the show with
a new backdrop and more female-oriented material." It has been my experience
that once the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> start lightening things up with a new backdrop, it is
only a matter of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX> until the launch of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> called "Send us your home
videotapes!!!" And then, I'm afraid, we will have to bid them all a fond
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">farewell</ENAMEX>.

            Moving right along, are these darn <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> running for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> now more
transparently phoney than usual or is it just me and my razor-keen
observational abilities? Not just because <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George W.</ENAMEX> couldn't name <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> of
world hot spots. (Although I loved his answer regarding the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prime minister</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>, which went, "The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prime minister</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> is ... I don't know." He
apparently was thinking that if he got up a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of steam and energetically
repeated the question, the answer might come to him from nowhere.) But I just
read a piece in which the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supporters</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George W.</ENAMEX> are explaining their
attraction to him with thoughts like "Don't ask me what draws me to him. I was
terribly fond of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>, so he has a place in my heart." This makes me
think that more of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> should be using a "get to know my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>"
kind of an angle in their campaigns.

            And as for the ever-morphing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Gore</ENAMEX>, pictured <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this weekend</TIMEX> wearing an army
hat for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Veterans Day</ENAMEX>, maybe he should just hire a spokesmodel to deliver his
speeches while he's figuring out who to be. By the way, I think he got the
wrong message about being an alpha male from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Naomi Wolf</ENAMEX>. In my opinion, the
proper route to appearing more alpha is not earth tones, as suggested,
but would be for him to wear a leather jacket, suck on a cigarette butt, and
make a bunch of appointments to meet with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> that he suddenly
cancels at the very last <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> without offering an explanation. Now
that's an alpha male as I have come to know and love them. (His other
option would be to employ the technique they explain in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX>-training manuals
for use when you have a problem dominating your alpha-male pet. What they tell
you to do is to pin him down and lie on top of him. If <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> tried that on
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX> during their next debate, I think we might all see him a little
differently.)

            Your new best <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill</ENAMEX>
