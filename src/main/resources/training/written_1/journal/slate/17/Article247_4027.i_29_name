            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dear Merrill</ENAMEX>,

            Good <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> again. It's embarrassing to admit this, but while I was walking
in to work <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> asleep, I actually spilled my corner-convenience-store
coffee all over myself, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> in excruciatingly unoriginal sitcoms and
lame romantic comedies often do. It was pure, unadulterated bad physical comedy
at its <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">finest</TIMEX>, complete with pinwheeling, flailing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX>, and shouts of
"Whooooaaaah!" from yours truly. The only thing dumber would have been if I'd
driven a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">golf cart</ENAMEX> into a pool. Passing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">motorists</ENAMEX> openly mocked me as they sped
by. What's more, after later discovering an unfamiliar set of keys in my
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pocket</ENAMEX>, I subsequently realized that apparently, while stumbling around in a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stupor</ENAMEX> after shutting off the alarm clock, I'd put on my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girlfriend</ENAMEX>'s pants by
mistake.

            So what I want to know is: If time and space are now obsolete (my theory is
even more radical, by the way: I think that they always were obsolete)
then why do I still have to get up this early to file my copy for
Slate
               !?!?

            I saw <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Movie</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">last night</TIMEX> as promised. What a great, great
movie. I guess by this point I shouldn't have been surprised when the end
credits rolled and I found out that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Stipe</ENAMEX> was one of the executive
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">producers</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Happiness</ENAMEX> , then the going-into-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Malkovich</ENAMEX>'s-mind
movie, and now this: That crazy loontune <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stipe</ENAMEX> is really on a roll. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> of
the best movies I've seen in recent memory, and they all owe their existence
not to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">studios</ENAMEX> but to an arguably psychotic alternative rock
star with a heart of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX> and the wisdom to put his <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> where they can do
a lot of good. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stipe</ENAMEX> ought to be picked up and carried around on the shoulders
of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX> of cheering moviegoers in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>. (On <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> thought, let's can
that idea: He'd probably just get depressed over all the attention.)

            As regards the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> news: I toweled off my copy of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> enough
to make out this headline on Page <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A12</TIMEX>: "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Talks on Paying Nazi-Era Slaves Turn</ENAMEX>
Sour." This may not be the deepest reaction, but I couldn't help wondering ...
at what point exactly do negotiations for reparation payments to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">concentration-camp</ENAMEX> forced-labor slaves "turn" sour? You'd think such an
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interchange</ENAMEX> would be pretty much non-amiable and non-gregarious pretty much
from the word go. Were the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Germans</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">survivors</ENAMEX> sipping <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cocktails</ENAMEX> on the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">veranda</ENAMEX> and enjoying a nice game of croquet in the garden before the polite
conversation suddenly came to an awkward halt? Gee, I hope nobody got
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">offended</ENAMEX>.

            Being as I'm still in a bit of a sour mood myself over the coffee incident,
I'd better send this off. Trudging home now to change pants ...

            Sourly,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Todd</ENAMEX>
