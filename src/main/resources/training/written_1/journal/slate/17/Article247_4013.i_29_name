            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dear Todd</ENAMEX>,

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whew</ENAMEX>. Calm down, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bunny</ENAMEX>. I want you drink a cup of herbal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> and take a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">multivitamin</ENAMEX>. I'm sure there must be a sphygmomanometer in a desk drawer
somewhere at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Onion</ENAMEX> . I'd like you to ask your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> to please
check your blood pressure.

            While we're waiting for it to drop back to human levels, let's talk for a
minute about our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX>, the brand new planet. Apparently they took the
first-ever direct photographs of a new (to us) planet circling a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">star</ENAMEX> outside
our solar system. The disturbing thing is that it is described in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">L.A.</ENAMEX>
Times as "a bloated gas <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">giant</ENAMEX>." <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only one</NUMEX> photograph in and already the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">name-calling</ENAMEX> has started. At this rate, I won't be surprised if they never get
close enough to snap a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> photo.

            There's actually a front-page headline in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L.A. Times</ENAMEX> today that
reads "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Time, Space Obsolete in New View of Universe</ENAMEX>." <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time and Space</ENAMEX>. Gone.
Just like that. "The notion of space-time is something we've cherished for
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>," it goes on to say, "and it's clearly something we're going
to have to give up." Another fine old premise right down the dumper, tossed
away like TV variety shows and the idea that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cheese</ENAMEX> is a health <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX>.
Personally, I'm kind of relaxed about the whole thing, as I have never
exhibited much skill at organizing either space or time. But I am a little
concerned over the new talk among the string <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">theorists</ENAMEX>, who are at the
forefront of revolutionizing our thinking about these things, that the universe
may have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> dimensions. How much do you want to bet you that when they make
this all more tangible and we find out where those <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> dimensions are exactly, I
already have piles of papers and unopened mail cluttering up the surfaces of at
least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> of them?

            There's a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">revolutionary</ENAMEX> thinking going on. In the health and fitness
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> , there's a piece about a new
no-holds-barred book for adolescent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Deal With It</ENAMEX>! A Whole New
Approach to <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Your Body, Brain and Life as a Gurl</ENAMEX> . In it, not only do they
designate a new spelling for "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX>" (!) and are not afraid to discuss vaginal
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">discharge</ENAMEX> (!), but apparently "tampons are drawn with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grinning</ENAMEX> faces." I'm
sorry. This is going too far. Not just anthropomorphizing tampons but also
characterizing them as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cheerful</ENAMEX> willing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>. It disturbs me the same
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> I am always disturbed when my dinner entree is depicted on a menu as a
smiling cartoon sailor dancing the hornpipe. It's just more emotional stress
than I need to have to see my <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> having a great time on shore leave just
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> before its death. When I was an adolescent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX>, I had a book by that
great behavioral <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">star</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TV</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bloopers and Practical Jokes</ENAMEX> ,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dick Clark</ENAMEX>. It was called <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Twixt Twelve and Twenty</ENAMEX> . I can't recall a
single thing it said, but I do know this much: He never once mentioned vaginal
discharge. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">those days</TIMEX> there were no cartoon tampons, but if there were, they
would have been depicted as the grim-faced civil <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">servants</ENAMEX> we know them to truly
be.

            There's a lot going on in the book world. How about the fact that the new
<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">60-pound</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helmut Newton</ENAMEX> photograph anthology comes with its own coffee table!
The idea of matching a book with an accessory or item of furniture that is
essential to its enjoyment could be the breakthrough in publishing that
everyone has been looking for. Lengthy fiction can come with a reclining chair.
Textbooks with a pillow and a cot. Books that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publishers</ENAMEX> know are
impossible to make sense of could come with another book that you'll like
better when you get fed up that you wasted your money. I don't know.

            If you're not busy <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX>, would you like to go with me to an auction in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rancho Santa Fe</ENAMEX> of the household items left over by the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Heaven's Gate</ENAMEX> cult
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> when they left their "earthly vehicles" and went into the sky to join
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Halley</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Comet</ENAMEX>? Apparently there are kitchenwares, TVs ... I have dibs on the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trampoline</ENAMEX>. I remember reading that they had a seating chart for watching TV. I
would pay a pretty <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">penny</NUMEX> for that one. I never know where to sit.

            Talk to you soon.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Love</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill</ENAMEX>

            P.S.: A few additional thoughts. You wrote, "He could've made a movie called
Fuck You, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pope</ENAMEX> if he wanted." I don't know if this could have been a big
studio picture in wide release unless he got financing from someone like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joel</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Silver</ENAMEX>. In my experience, by the time his movie got through all the rewrite
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">committees</ENAMEX>, it would <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">star</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Julia Roberts</ENAMEX> and probably be called That <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vatican</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Summer</TIMEX> .
