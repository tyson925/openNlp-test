            It's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX>: Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past week</TIMEX>, in rapid succession, the editorial pages
of both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> endorsed what
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> called a "disarmingly simple alternative to traditional
affirmative action" when it comes to college admissions. The solution?
Guaranteed admission to college for a fixed percentage of the top <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> in
each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">high school</ENAMEX>, regardless of grades or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SAT</ENAMEX> scores. Although race-blind, this
policy has the effect of boosting minority admissions--basically because it
admits the top <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> at predominantly black high <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> even if those
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> score lower than white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> who aren't at the top of other
(generally richer and whiter) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>.

            Call it the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X Percent Solution</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>, where <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">race-based</NUMEX> admissions at the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Texas</ENAMEX> were struck down by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>, the state
guaranteed admission to the top <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 percent</NUMEX> of each public high school--and
black admissions at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UT</ENAMEX> rebounded. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> adopted a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4 percent</NUMEX> rule after a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">voter</ENAMEX> initiative, <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Prop. 209</ENAMEX>, banned race preferences at state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">colleges</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">universities</ENAMEX>. More recently, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gov.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeb Bush</ENAMEX> issued an executive
order guaranteeing state university admission to the top <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 percent</NUMEX> of each
high school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">graduating class</ENAMEX>--again, as a replacement for a race-based
affirmative action program.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> hailed the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> policy in an editorial <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last Saturday</TIMEX> (even
though <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> it dismissed the idea as "tinkering"). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX>
followed on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX>, saying that if the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> Percent Solution "turns out to get the
job done without explicit resort to race or ethnicity . . . why not?" The
Solution also has support on the right--from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governors</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeb Bush</ENAMEX>,
most obviously, but also (at least in its diluted, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4 percent</NUMEX> form) from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ward</ENAMEX>
Connerly, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of California</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regent</ENAMEX> who has led the fight against
race preferences in his <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>.

            So, hey, everybody's happy! But has anyone really thought through the full
implications of this convenient fix? Has the divisive, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX>-long debate over
affirmative action really been defused by a clever policy gimmick? It's not
impossible. But there's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> obvious problem: The gimmick depends on
high school segregation. If there weren't all-black ghetto high <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>, then
admitting the top <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">X Percent</NUMEX> of each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> wouldn't have the effect of
admitting so many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX>. Indeed, if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> were perfectly integrated by race,
and equal in quality, then automatically admitting the top <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 percent</NUMEX> at each
school probably wouldn't make much difference in admissions at all (when
compared with a straight policy of simply admitting "top" <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> regardless
of where they went to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>.)

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> seems to think this contradiction is really a delicious
irony. ("The residential segregation that persists in so much of the nation
becomes an instrument for desegregating higher education.") But it's more than
that. The dynamic could easily work the other way--with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> Percent solution
in education becoming an instrument for furthering residential segregation, as
black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> with high-performing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> decide to keep their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> in
all-black neighborhoods because that will virtually guarantee their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> a
ticket to college.

            This dilemma is particularly acute for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supporters</ENAMEX> of school choice (mostly
on the right) who hope that vouchers, or other choice mechanisms such as
charter <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>, will encourage motivated black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> to leave bad schools
and attend better ones. But why would a black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> who is near the top of
his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> at a lousy public high school--and therefore guaranteed college
admission under the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> Percent Solution--leave to go to a much better high
school where he's apt to rank in the middle of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX>? Indeed, why would any
good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX>, black or white, leave a bad <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> for a good <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> if he ranks
much higher at the former than at the latter? The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> Percent Solution seems to
subvert the basic mechanism that is supposed to make school choice work. What's
your answer, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gov.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>? (Either one of you!)

            There are other problems with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X Percent Solution</ENAMEX>: Even if there's no
school choice, won't it remove a major incentive for poor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> to improve?
After all, their top <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 percent</NUMEX> get into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">college</ENAMEX> anyway! And what happens
should society become more integrated, and the need for an <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">X Percent</NUMEX> set-aside
diminish? Do you want to be the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politician</ENAMEX> who tries to take away a
neighborhood <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">high school</ENAMEX>'s traditional <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">X percent</NUMEX> quota? The
guaranteed-admission slots could become an unassailable entitlement, as hard to
cut as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security COLA</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> for public-policy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalists</ENAMEX>, especially on the right, to investigate
these complications. It may turn out that the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> Percent gimmick is just that,
and that if you want to substitute class-based preferences for race-based
preferences, there's no short-cut that miraculously avoids the need to examine
each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX>'s record--or that automatically produces high minority
admissions.
