            News reports about the crashes of EgyptAir
Flight <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">990</NUMEX> and the private <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> carrying golfer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Payne Stewart</ENAMEX> have focused on
the use of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">airplanes</ENAMEX>' autopilots. What exactly do autopilots
do?

            The autopilot is an electronic system that manipulates the
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> "control surfaces" that determine an airplane's course: the movable
panels, called ailerons, on the back of each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX> that
allow the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> to bank right or left; the tail rudder, which turns the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aircraft</ENAMEX>'s nose; and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">elevators</ENAMEX>, which point the plane up or down. The
autothrottle, which determines the airplane's speed, is controlled by a
separate system.

            On commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>, the autopilot and autothrottle are
controlled by an advanced onboard navigational computer called the flight
management system (FMS). Typically, a pilot programs the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FMS</ENAMEX> before takeoff,
entering landmarks, altitude, and desired speed; during flight, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FMS</ENAMEX> uses
instrument readings and radio signals from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fixed</NUMEX> points on the ground to figure
out what adjustments are needed to meet the flight plan. If a human is in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">command</ENAMEX>, he or she must make the changes by hand; with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">autopilot</ENAMEX> engaged,
these adjustments are made automatically.

            Autopilots have several advantages. Primarily, they help keep
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crew</ENAMEX> from getting tired, leaving them free to alter the flight plan, scout
for traffic, and monitor the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX>'s other systems (like hydraulics and air
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pressurization</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Autopilots</ENAMEX> also improve fuel efficiency and passenger comfort,
since the adjustments made by an autopilot are more subtle and accurate than
those made by hand.

            That's why <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">autopilots</ENAMEX> are typically engaged on commercial
aircraft throughout nearly the entire flight. When human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> take
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX>--usually during takeoff and landing, and occasionally in mid
flight--it's largely because they need to stay in practice, not because the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">autopilot</ENAMEX> would be unable to fly safely. (In fact, in bad weather, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> may
require that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> allow the autopilot and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FMS</ENAMEX>, which don't rely on visual
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cues</ENAMEX>, to land the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX>.) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Pilots</ENAMEX> also take command in turbulence since an
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">autopilot</ENAMEX> would waste <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fuel</ENAMEX> and possibly exacerbate the bumps by making many
adjustments to keep the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> on a steady course. If a pilot doesn't disengage
the autopilot before taking control, the FMS interprets his movements as
outside <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> and instructs the autopilot to work against them.
