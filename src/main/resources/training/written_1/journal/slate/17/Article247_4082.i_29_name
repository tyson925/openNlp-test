            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Evan</ENAMEX>:

            Between the toilet and the bowl. I'm shifting in my seat just thinking about
it. I'm also thinking of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about a dozen</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">crude</ENAMEX> and ugly things to say in
response, but since this is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Breakfast Table</ENAMEX> and not the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Bar Stool</ENAMEX>, I won't
share them.

            But speaking of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dicks</ENAMEX>, I'm glad you brought up <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Brill</ENAMEX>. The saddest
thing about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brill</ENAMEX> is that he's a genuinely smart <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> who has destroyed his
reputation, become a joke among his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peers</ENAMEX>, and wasted a ton of cash, all for
the sake of ... what? That silly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX>? The chance to make morally superior
noises on cable once in a while? I don't understand it.

            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A few years ago</TIMEX> I went out to lunch with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brill</ENAMEX> and came away impressed. He
spent the entire meal explaining why we ought to put television cameras in
every <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtroom</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O.J.</ENAMEX> spectacle was in full bloom at the time,
and I remember thinking that it took pretty hefty stones to contend that anyone
(apart from, say, those with a financial stake in Court TV) could benefit from
a televised trial. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brill</ENAMEX> did. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ludicrous</ENAMEX>, I said. He came back at me with
such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> and with what seemed like such a tight argument that by the end I
was almost ready to agree that what the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> really needs is more
TelePrompTers, maybe a lavaliere mike or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>. That'd make the legal system more
efficient and just.

            I'm happy to say I recovered my senses shortly after leaving the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX>.
But my impression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brill</ENAMEX> as a vigorous, capable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> remained. Until he put
his own name in the title of his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX>, and in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a thousand</NUMEX> other ways made an
ass of himself. What a waste. It still depresses me to see him on
television.

            Just as it depresses me to see a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> I work for flayed in the Monday
business section of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> . I hope you won't think less of
me for taking a huge, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cringing</ENAMEX> pass on that story. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Media</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">conglomerates</ENAMEX> and the
use of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actors</ENAMEX> to sell <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazines</ENAMEX> are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> topics that make me pretty
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">uncomfortable</ENAMEX> (though I know so little about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX> that most of the time I
have no idea who's being synergized and who's not), so <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX>
piece was particularly hard for me to get through.

            It did leave me wondering, and not for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time, who these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are
who buy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazines</ENAMEX> based on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">celebrity</ENAMEX> cover photo. Here's my thinking on the
subject: Magazine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who've chosen reading over watching
television or going to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mall</ENAMEX> or playing video games as a form of
entertainment. This is a relatively small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, presumably more
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">literate</ENAMEX>--or at least interested in becoming more literate--than the average
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>. Yet these are also <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who will buy a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> simply because it has
a photograph <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ricky Martin</ENAMEX> on the cover (though not necessarily a real story
about him inside)? Can this be true? Help me here. I'm getting depressed
again.

            Best,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tucker</ENAMEX>
