            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Culturebox</ENAMEX> never dreamed, when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times Op-Ed</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">columnist</ENAMEX> and
suburban <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mom</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anna Quindlen</ENAMEX> abandoned journalism for fiction-writing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five years</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ago</TIMEX>, that it would be nice to have her back. But consider the hole she left
behind her in the pundit universe. The columns of her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">successor</ENAMEX> at the
Times , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maureen Dowd</ENAMEX>, consist of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Heathers</ENAMEX> -like pronunciamentos
upon the coolness of this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politician</ENAMEX> and the uncoolness of that one, each
punctuated by a saucy flounce. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quindlen</ENAMEX>'s predecessor in the slot at
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek</ENAMEX> she began to fill <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</TIMEX>, the late <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Meg Greenfield</ENAMEX>, issued
closely argued bulletins from somewhere deep inside a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> dinner <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quindlen</ENAMEX> is neither saucy nor <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> step ahead of the conventional wisdom, but
her virtues are ones that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Culturebox</ENAMEX> suspects it's unhealthy to do without:
She's substantive and stern; she's loyal to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>; she makes peace,
not war; she favors old-fashioned horse sense over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">brilliance</TIMEX>. " 'To see
ourselves as others see us,' was the line my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandmother</ENAMEX> would always throw out
when she was crabby and I was full of myself," is the sort of thing she's wont
to declare--wisely, self-deprecatingly, and only somewhat preachily. Culturebox
would count herself lucky to have <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anna Quindlen</ENAMEX> as a big <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX>, though she'd
probably throttle the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year or two</TIMEX>.

            Let's clear up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">another</NUMEX> common misconception while we're at it. Big
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX>-ish though she may be, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quindlen's</ENAMEX> is not the voice of feminism in our
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>. It's easy to mistake it for that, and her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> generally do, making
her a springboard for an attack on feminism in general. She draws on her own
experience, thereby making the personal political, and was for a long time the
only female voice on the white, male <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Times Op-Ed</ENAMEX> page. She favors what
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critic</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karen Lehrman</ENAMEX>, calls "motherhood politics"--she's for stuff that's
good for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> and against stuff that's bad for them. But feminism is an
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ideology</ENAMEX>, which is to say a relatively coherent intellectual position, a set of
arguments attached to a political objective. So weighty an agenda demands a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">consistency Quindlen</ENAMEX> has not, so far, evinced. Insofar as she's a feminist,
she's a pop feminist--an <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oprah</ENAMEX> or Lifetime feminist, a cheerleader for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> in all their travails. But we read <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quindlen</ENAMEX>, if we do, for her peppy
style, and that emerges out of another tradition entirely--not the reformist
rhetoric of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Susan B. Anthony</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Betty Friedan</ENAMEX> but the homespun, folksy, and
often surprisingly liberal tones of an earlier era in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> journalism, when
newspaper editorialists and magazine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> and advice <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">columnists</ENAMEX> elevated the
anecdote of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> life to the status of gospel and did more than just about
anyone else to invent our <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20 th -century</TIMEX> idea of everydayness.

            In short, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quindlen</ENAMEX> is a sentimentalist, which is not an insult in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Culturebox</ENAMEX>'s book, since to harden one's heart to sentimentalism is to take
oneself beyond the reach of much of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> culture. Some of those whose
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sensibility Quindlen</ENAMEX> shares happen be female--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ann Landers</ENAMEX>, Dear <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abby</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mary</ENAMEX>
Worth, the well-coiffed, well-born newspaper comic-strip <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heroine</ENAMEX> who has been
dispensing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sage</ENAMEX> advice to her less well-adapted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1938</TIMEX>. But
others are male, such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">illustrator</ENAMEX> who create <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Worth</ENAMEX> anew
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Horace Lorimer</ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> of the old magazine the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Evening Post</ENAMEX> and an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aphorist</ENAMEX> whose nuggets of wisdom sound
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">uncannily Quindlenesque</ENAMEX>: "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Education</ENAMEX> is about the only thing lying around loose
in the world, and it's about the only thing a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fellow</ENAMEX> can have as much of he's
willing to haul away" is one of his more famous ones. Another <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Quindlen</ENAMEX>-like
figure was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Allen White</ENAMEX>, the great <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">turn-of-the-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> of the
Emporia, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kansas</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gazette</ENAMEX> , who deployed his aw-shucks tone to attack
heartland know-nothingism and populism, but whose greatest column is widely
acknowledged to be his elegy to his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX>, who died after she ran into a
low-hanging <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> while riding a horse.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ann Landers</ENAMEX> and her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> believe in good behavior; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">White</ENAMEX> believed in the
importance of humor, dignity, and not being provincial; what does <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quindlen</ENAMEX> feel
strongly about? Editorials are supposed to be the literature of opinion, but
for the key to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quindlen</ENAMEX>'s core beliefs you must turn to her novels. These are
as morally instructive in their way as the works of another, far greater
sentimentalist, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Harriet Beecher Stowe</ENAMEX>, author of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Uncle Tom's Cabin</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quindlen</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> novel, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Object Lessons</ENAMEX> , is a coming-of-age story about
the perils of letting others tell you what to do in life. The homily is
provided by--who else?--the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heroine</ENAMEX>'s best <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX>'s smart and unusually poised
big <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX>: "Just remember that sometimes you drift into things, and then you
can't get out of them," the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> advises the novel's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">protagonist</ENAMEX>. "Not to
decide is to decide." One <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">True Thing</ENAMEX> , the story of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> who comes
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> to take care of her dying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> and winds up accused of euthanasia,
echoes that lesson but ups the ante: If you're passive enough to let your
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> dump their problems on you, they can darn near destroy your life.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quindlen</ENAMEX>'s latest novel, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Black and Blue</ENAMEX> , makes the consequences of
letting someone else tell you what to do even more horrifyingly explicit: It's
the movie-of-the-week-type saga of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> on the run from her abusive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quindlen</ENAMEX>'s message is clear: You have to figure out who you are, think for
yourself, take some responsibility, for crying out loud.

            As convictions go, it's not the most original around, but it's not a
terrible one either. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quindlen</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> column in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek</ENAMEX> is more of the
same. This time, the den-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> persona is underscored by the photograph that
accompanies the piece, of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quindlen</ENAMEX> with sensibly cropped hair. The editorial is
a sigh of disgust at the whole <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brooklyn Museum</ENAMEX> mess. It's slightly smarter than
most on this subject, with more of a sense of history (she tosses the New York
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Society for the Suppression</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice</ENAMEX> into the mix). But ah, yes, here comes the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">grandmotherly language</ENAMEX>: "Oh, for pity's sake, here we go again." Here's the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">liberal</ENAMEX> common sense: "[<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">I</ENAMEX>]n other news, cops are being accused of savagery,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priests</ENAMEX> of impropriety, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> are failing in the New York
City <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>. And civic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX>, both political and religious, are using their
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bully pulpits</ENAMEX> for this?" So what if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quindlen</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about a week</TIMEX> late to the story?
The point is, she's right, as she usually is. It wouldn't hurt us to eat our
fiber when she tells us to, or to grow up, either.
