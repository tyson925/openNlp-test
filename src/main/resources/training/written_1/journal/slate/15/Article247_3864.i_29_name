            I find, as you suggested, that computers are having an impact on student
writing. More and more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> compose at the keyboard, and some are even
becoming comfortable editing on-screen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Students</ENAMEX> spends lots of time using
computers, and right now that means they're writing and reading a lot, since
using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Web</ENAMEX> and sending e-mail requires lots of writing and reading.

            In the bookstore <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> I was looking over <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clifford Stoll</ENAMEX>'s new book
attacking computer use in education. I haven't read the book, so I can't
summarize his stance, but on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> page he was complaining that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> spent
too much time interfacing via computer, to the detriment of face-to-face
experience. He cites a teen-age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> who boasted of spending his entire summer
vacation online and quotes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one 13-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> who insists the only way to
meet <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> to is log on. I think <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stoll</ENAMEX>'s probably overestimating how much time
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teen-agers</ENAMEX> spend wired, though I do see that computer technology often blinds
us to the possibilities of using more traditional technologies. I remember once
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleague</ENAMEX> who came running into my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> complaining that his e-mail was
down and he needed to get some vital information from a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleague</ENAMEX> several
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> away. While we scratched our heads figuring out how he could e-mail his
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleague</ENAMEX> from my workstation, a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> came up and suggested, "Why not
use the telephone?" We hadn't thought of that!

            I would argue that all writing is a technology, and to emphasize the
technological aspect of writing I have my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> spend <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an hour</TIMEX> writing in an
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">old</ENAMEX>, unfamiliar technology. I give each student <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4 ounces</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>'s modeling
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">clay</ENAMEX>, a wooden <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">skewer</ENAMEX>, a length of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Â¾-inch</NUMEX> dowel, and a writing assignment.
Their task is to fashion the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">clay</ENAMEX> into a writing surface, then do the writing
assignment using the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">clay</ENAMEX> and the wooden stylus. When they are done, we talk
about how this was different from the more conventional writing technologies
they are used to: pencil and paper, computer (few seem to use typewriters
anymore). As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam Johnson</ENAMEX> might have put it, writing on clay really concentrates
the mind. It forces you to think about elements of writing that have become
more or less automatic in a more ordinary setting. Here are some of things my
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> find: You look at writing differently if you have to prepare the
surface. Inscribing on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">clay</ENAMEX> means you can't use cursive very easily, or even
rounded print <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clay</ENAMEX>'s not easy to edit. And it's not that easy to
read the final product. You can't put a lot of writing on <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">four ounces</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">clay</ENAMEX>,
and you can really only use <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> side, so you have to make all the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">space</ENAMEX> count.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clay</ENAMEX> could get heavy if you had to carry around <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than a few</NUMEX> "pages" of it.
And clay allows you to play with document design in ways you might not with
pencil and paper.

            Will computer use improve <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> writing? Not necessarily, although there's
some suggestion that writing a lot does help, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> are writing more
with computers than they were before, so far as I can tell. It's certainly
easier to revise on a computer: <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Students</ENAMEX> tend to forget that "cut and paste"
once involved literal scissors and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glue</ENAMEX>, a laborious process that I used to get
me through a dissertation <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">almost 30 years ago</TIMEX>. I myself can write for longer
stretches using a computer, with less physical and psychological strain, than
when I was using an electric typewriter. New writing technologies have their
downsides, inevitably. There was a complaint voiced in the New York
Times when typewriters were coming into favor in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> that the
typewriter depersonalized the written word, since the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> seemed further
removed from actual contact with the human element in writing. To some extent
this was true, but it was also a bit silly, since before the typewriter there
was a great emphasis on people developing uniform, depersonalized handwriting
to ensure legibility. The computer allows us to revise, true, but in that
process I see that we lose what I call the "archeology" of the text, the stages
through which it passes from <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> to final draft. I used to miss that. Now I
don't.

            But here's something to ponder, and let it be my farewell to this chat,
which I've found interesting and hope that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> over our shoulders did
as well: The next generation of text processing with computers promises
sophisticated voice-to-text programs. Is the keyboarding of text only a
temporary phenomenon, then? Will we, or our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, be talking their essays
into microphones, composing peripatetically and out loud like Wordsworth
"writing" his poems, or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bosses</ENAMEX> dictating letters to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretaries</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1950s</TIMEX> TV
sitcoms? I trust that that will still count as "writing," though I imagine some
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">technophobes</ENAMEX> will insist that it is not writing since the composition will be
untouched by human hands. In any case, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesse</ENAMEX>, I leave it to you to have the
last word.

            Best,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dennis</ENAMEX>
