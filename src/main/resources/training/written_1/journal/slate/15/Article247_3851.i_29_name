            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesse</ENAMEX>,

            I agree with you that languages and language varieties are both adaptable
and multifunctional. I will add to the mix of comments on this discussion the
observation that we are all adaptable and multifunctional in our individual
language use--even the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> (that is, those from the former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Great</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>--oops, just kidding, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX>) control <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> variety of the
language. You know those radio shows, all news, all the time? We are all
multidialectal, all of the time, mastering levels of formality, adjusting
content to context in speech as well as writing. And our language is not
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">limited</ENAMEX>: It can grow and mature, adapt, and in some cases even atrophy. We lose
and gain words, expressions, pronunciations. Language is creative: We can
manipulate it to match a new concept, or a new invention, or simply to tell a
joke. And we seem able to use language to discover new concepts as well.

            Language is also a kind of self-regulating system, adjusting system-wide to
its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX>' needs and whims, and it is also a system in which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">users</ENAMEX> attempt
formal and informal kinds of regulation, establishing standards or trying to do
so, making judgments about our own language use and that of other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> (in
the words of the radio commercial, "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People judge</ENAMEX> you by the words you use
..."). I find that formal attempts at regulation--language laws and language
policies, often fail to achieve their ends, or achieve ends somewhat different
from what may have been intended. I find that we all establish linguistic
standards and try (but often fail) to adhere to them; but interestingly, our
standards don't align. Our linguistic use and preference vary slightly from
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>, so the system remains in motion.

            I also find that when it comes to discussing language, we have a significant
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">user-</ENAMEX>vs.-expert problem: <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Users</ENAMEX> of language claim a certain amount of expertise,
and rightly so; but they also tend to reject or challenge what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> have to
say. Again a complicating, subjective factor is that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> are also <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX>, a
situation that both compromises and informs their expertise.

            Is it your experience that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> on language are challenged with greater
regularity by the general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> than, say, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> on math (let's leave
evolutionists out of this for the moment)?

            Language is a complex issue as well as a complex phenomenon. When language
is perceived to be a public problem (bilingual education, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poor</ENAMEX> writing test
scores, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nonstandard</ENAMEX> usage), the public seeks simple <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solutions</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Make English</ENAMEX>
official; teach more grammar; emphasize correctness. But simple solutions don't
seem to work for complex problems, either in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">language</ENAMEX> or in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX>.

            By the way, to return to the subject I introduced <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this morning</TIMEX>: In addition
to the grammar-gene study, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleague</ENAMEX> reminded me of a medical study a few
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX> that showed writing could improve the immune system by actually
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stimulating T</ENAMEX>-cells. And I myself remembered the so-called "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nun</ENAMEX> study," which
claimed that sentence complexity in writing could be used as a predictor of
<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Alzheimer's disease</ENAMEX> later in life (in essence, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nuns</ENAMEX> who wrote simple sentences
as novices were more likely to be <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Alzheimer's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> in old age; those writing
more complex sentences were less likely to contract it). I've downloaded the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JAMA</ENAMEX> article, and while I haven't had a chance to read it yet, I did
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">notice</ENAMEX> that the experiment was structured so that some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> were asked
to write about their most stressful experience, while the control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> was
asked to write about their plans for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX>. Those writing about <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX> showed
the most improvement.
