            Issue <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX>'s defeat of the nuclear test ban
treaty. Issue <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AFL-CIO</ENAMEX>'s endorsement of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Gore</ENAMEX>. Issue <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> is campaign
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">finance</ENAMEX> reform.

            The punditocracy splits over the political and
substantive fallout, if you will, of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Comprehensive</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Nuclear] Test Ban</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treaty</ENAMEX>--which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> overwhelmingly defeated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">President</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> had begged the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GOP</ENAMEX> to delay the vote. Conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pundits</ENAMEX>--such as
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Novak</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Meet the Press</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNN</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Capital Gang</ENAMEX> ), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brit Hume</ENAMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fox News Sunday</ENAMEX> ), and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Gigot</ENAMEX>
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">NewsHour With Jim Lehrer</ENAMEX> )--think the
defeat resulted from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s hubris and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GOP</ENAMEX>'s sound appraisal of the
national interest. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Liberal pundits</ENAMEX>--such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark Shields</ENAMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">NewsHour and Capital Gang</ENAMEX> ), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Margaret</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carlson</ENAMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Capital Gang</ENAMEX> ), and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Juan Williams</ENAMEX>
( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fox</ENAMEX> )--think the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GOP</ENAMEX> is risking an arms race in
order to humiliate <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>.

Some opinion <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">makers</ENAMEX>, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Roberts</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNN</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Late Edition</ENAMEX> ), think that the treaty's
defeat heralds a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buchananite</ENAMEX> lurch toward isolationism in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GOP</ENAMEX>. Moreover,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alfonse D'Amato</ENAMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fox</ENAMEX> ) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Juan Williams</ENAMEX>
( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fox</ENAMEX> ) think <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> will inevitably win the
public relations war, given the public's overwhelming support for the treaty.
But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conservatives</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Gigot</ENAMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">NewsHour</ENAMEX> )
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tucker Carlson</ENAMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Late Edition</ENAMEX> ) counter that
many former foreign-policy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisers</ENAMEX>--including some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">appointees</ENAMEX>--opposed
the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">treaty</ENAMEX>, and that when it comes to foreign policy as a campaign issue,
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> still have the advantage. (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">On Capital</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gang</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitch McConnell</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ky.</ENAMEX>, notes that only one of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> up for re-election <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</TIMEX> voted for the treaty.) But even
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carlson</ENAMEX> thinks <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Gore</ENAMEX>'s un-glitzy, pro-test-ban TV ad was smart, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Susan</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Page</ENAMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Late Edition</ENAMEX> ) thinks <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX>'s pro-treaty
stance will help him with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women voters</ENAMEX> (who worry about nuclear apocalypse more
than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iowa</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX> (who have a lingering nuclear-freeze streak in
them from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1980s</TIMEX>). Only <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">John McLaughlin</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McLaughlin Group</ENAMEX> ) actually addresses whether we
still need to test nukes (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McLaughlin</ENAMEX> thinks we do). (For more on the treaty
defeat, see "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Week/The Spin</ENAMEX>" and "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Papers</ENAMEX>.")

            Most of the commentariat thinks that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Gore</ENAMEX>'s
endorsement by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AFL-CIO</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEA</ENAMEX> represents a small victory. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Labor</ENAMEX>, notes
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Hunt</ENAMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Capital Gang</ENAMEX> ), is still a powerful
organizing tool in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iowa</ENAMEX>. Nevertheless, many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pundits</ENAMEX> point out that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Teamsters</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAW</ENAMEX> have not yet endorsed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX>, and that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Bradley</ENAMEX> now has
as much money as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> does. And many also criticize the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> for
telling the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> that he might not seek any campaign assistance
from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>; that may be a smart strategy in the general election, say <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Susan</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Estrich</ENAMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fox</ENAMEX> ) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">D'Amato</ENAMEX>, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> can still
energize the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democratic</ENAMEX> base during the primary season. (To read <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Estrich</ENAMEX>'s

A few programs discuss <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John McCain</ENAMEX> and the prospects for campaign finance
reform. On <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Meet the Press</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert</ENAMEX>
Torricelli, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">N.J.</ENAMEX>, says he opposes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain</ENAMEX>'s reform bill because it's too weak,
while <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McConnell</ENAMEX> says it's too strong. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Broder</ENAMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Meet the Press</ENAMEX> ) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam Donaldson</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">This Week</ENAMEX> ) would like to change
the system, but neither knows exactly how. ("<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">One generation</TIMEX>'s reform is
another's problem," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Broder</ENAMEX> observes of the current <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Watergate-</ENAMEX>era laws.) DNC
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ed Rendell</ENAMEX> argues that without soft money, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX> wouldn't have
a prayer against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George W. Bush</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Stephanopoulos</ENAMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">This Week</ENAMEX> ) notes that the more <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX>
ostracize him for his crusade against "corruption," the more popular a
presidential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> he's likely to become.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hewing</ENAMEX> to the journalistic dictum to "sell every piece
twice," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark Shields</ENAMEX> has perfected the art of recycling his own sound bites.
Here's a sample from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past two weeks</TIMEX>:

[The treaty vote] was, to put it bluntly,
impeachment. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Betty Currie</ENAMEX>'s name was never mentioned; [an] obstruction of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">justice</ENAMEX> charge was never ventilated. There was no chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">justice</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX> sitting in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX>, but that's what it was. It was Impeachment <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Two</TIMEX>.
It was getting even with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>.
            

            
                    
-- <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">NewsHour</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10/15</NUMEX>

The reality is very simple. This was not with
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Betty Currie</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> or not with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Rehnquist</ENAMEX> sitting up there, [but] it
was nothing less than Impeachment <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Two</TIMEX>. And that was their chance of getting
even.
            

                  -- <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Capital Gang</ENAMEX> ,

He had as good <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a week this week</TIMEX> as I've ever seen
a non-incumbent presidential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> have in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>. He spent repeated time
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> of minority <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. He's comfortable there. This is something
that most presidential <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nominees</ENAMEX> don't do except in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a week</TIMEX> when the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX> are holding their convention and there aren't that many cameras
around. He does it, he does it easily, comfortably. He brought together <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">George</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pataki</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rudy Giuliani</ENAMEX>.
            

            
                    
-- <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">NewsHour</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10/8</NUMEX>

Let me just say I have never seen a candidate for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> in my lifetime who was not the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nominee</ENAMEX> of his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> have a better
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week</TIMEX> than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George W. Bush</ENAMEX> had. He goes to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>, he makes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> minority
community appearances. Usually the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nominees</ENAMEX> do their minority
appearances during the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democratic</ENAMEX> convention when there are no <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> around.
He's comfortable, he does it repeatedly. He has--he brings <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giuliani</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pataki</ENAMEX>
together.

Last Word
            

            From <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Capital Gang :</ENAMEX>

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitch</ENAMEX>
McConnell: If you're going to call the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> corrupt, if you're going
to call the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> corrupt, you need to prove it.

            Soft money goes to political <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX>. Political parties
don't have a vote. Soft money is everything that isn't hard money--let me
finish my answer. It finances issue discussion in this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> , for example, has had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">114</NUMEX>
editorials on campaign finance reform since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the beginning of 1997</TIMEX>. That's about
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every nine days</TIMEX>. They are a corporate soft money issue advocacy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outfit</ENAMEX>, as
is this [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX>] program financed by corporate soft money.

            [<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">campaign-finance</ENAMEX>] proposal would single out
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committees</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DNC</ENAMEX>, the national <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democratic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committees</ENAMEX>, the national
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committees</ENAMEX>, and say, "Only those <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> can't engage in issue advocacy.
Everybody else in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> will be doing it but us."

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark Shields</ENAMEX>:
That's the last word, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitch McConnell</ENAMEX>. I just have to say in closing, I've
learned <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">tonight</TIMEX> that the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">millions of dollars</NUMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX> have received from
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> had nothing to do with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX>' opposition to vouchers. I
guess <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> alone of all our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> are in--

            
               McConnell: Maybe
there were already opposed to that.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shields</ENAMEX>: No,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> are impervious and indifferent to large [amounts of money]--

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Hunt</ENAMEX>: It's a
wonderful, clean system.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Margaret Carlson</ENAMEX>:
What a great <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>.
