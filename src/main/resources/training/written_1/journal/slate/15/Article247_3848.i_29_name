            Good <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesse</ENAMEX>:

            An article from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicago Tribune</ENAMEX> , reprinted in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Jose</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mercury News</ENAMEX> , refers to a study reported in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal of the American</ENAMEX>
Medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Association</ENAMEX> that concludes writing may be beneficial for your
health. Now, that's what I call news. According to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JAMA</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX>
conducting the study asked <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> suffering from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">acute asthma</ENAMEX> or from
rheumatoid <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX> to write for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20 minutes</TIMEX> a day for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three consecutive days</TIMEX>.
They were asked not to concern themselves with the niceties of spelling,
punctuation, and so on. They were told instead, just write and write and write,
what we call in the profession <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">free-</ENAMEX>writing, I suppose.

            A significant number of study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> reported that their symptoms improved
with writing. This of course is good news. But even better is the prospect that
future studies may go on to show that writing may actually cure much of what
ails us (except for writing-induced ailments like <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">carpal tunnel syndrome</ENAMEX> or, if
you're still using a pencil, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX>'s bump--that unsightly callus on your index
finger caused by holding a writing implement).

            I'm not sure what the controls were for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JAMA</ENAMEX> study. Were an equal
number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">volunteers</ENAMEX> asked to not write for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20 minutes</TIMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> consecutive
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>? Did their symptoms then worsen, or remain the same? I know my own
symptoms would worsen if I were told not to write, since I write all the time.
But let's look at this 
                  Slate
                discussion for an example of
healthful praxis: I'm writing for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">more than 20 minutes</TIMEX> twice a day for what
will be <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four days</TIMEX>. Should I be taking my pulse and blood pressure regularly?
Should I not use my inhaler? (Actually, I do have an inhaler, but seldom need
to use it.) What should I expect to see happening? To whom do I report the
results? Will my HMO cover this?

            OK, you get my drift. I'm not convinced that writing holds promise as a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prophylactic</ENAMEX>. There have been a number of "scientific" studies like this one
that deal with language-related subjects but that are not really linguistic
studies. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A few years back</TIMEX> (hey, this is still on topic--I'm an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX>,
so I should know), there was some discussion in the press about the discovery
of a grammar gene by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neurologists</ENAMEX>. This was based on a study of an extended
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Montreal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, many of whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> exhibited certain curiosities in their
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">grammar</ENAMEX>: They could not form certain kinds of sentences, couldn't answer
questions, couldn't write clearly, and so on. It was held, in these popular
reports, that the discovery of the shared defective gene seen to cause the
symptoms would eventually lead to a cure not only for dyslexia but for freshman
composition--perhaps even for government prose. Guess what, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX>? It didn't
happen. It seems that writing, and grammar, are too complex to be controlled by
a single gene. And <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> is too complex, I'm guessing, to be palliated by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">journal</ENAMEX> writing.

            That is not to say that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> don't or won't find writing to be beneficial.
As an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> and a linguist, and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX>, I've been advocating
writing as good mental exercise for as long as I can remember. Of course, I was
a sickly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>, and one who wrote all the time. What does that tell us? Nothing
about writing, or health, actually.

            But once <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> read about the physical benefits that accrue from writing,
I'm sure that writing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinics</ENAMEX> will spring up in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>, land of all good
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fads</ENAMEX>, or if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JAMA</ENAMEX> study is discredited and writing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinics</ENAMEX> are
outlawed, then they will spring up in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>. I predict that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sick</ENAMEX> will make
a pilgrimage to these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinics</ENAMEX>, perhaps even swarming to our own <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX>'
workshop, where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student writers</ENAMEX> get help with their term-paper assignments.
Will writing become a remedy of the desperate, like grapefruit diets, coffee
enemas, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Krebiozen</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">copper</ENAMEX> bracelets--or does it work more like meditation,
prayer, or even beta carotenes? Will the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> start controlling writing? Will
there be minimum recommended doses? Warning labels on keyboards?

            I guess I'm satisfied that writing is good for you, won't cure a thing, and
anyway, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> seem not to have a choice in the matter: To paraphrase the
words of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gene Kelly</ENAMEX>, we just gotta write, gotta write ...

            Best,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dennis</ENAMEX>
