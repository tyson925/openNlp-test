            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dear Dennis</ENAMEX>,

            Judging from the responses to our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX>, we've skipped over some of the
issues important to most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, so perhaps we should go over dialects before
we return to some recent headlines.

            The very first question, about <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AAVE</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African-American Vernacular</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, the scholarly term for the dialect popularly referred to as "ebonics")
being unable to do math because their language can't handle it, is tied into
the biggest questions linguists face. The notion is a myth, of course. As you
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">observe</ENAMEX>, you yourself--the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> chair in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> at a major
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">university</ENAMEX>--find it hard to understand the math talk of your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX>. Does
that mean that you are incapable of doing math? Well, it would take some work
to develop the tools necessary. But that is true of the jargon of any specialty
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">field</ENAMEX>. A later respondent asks whether <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> is better suited for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hegel</ENAMEX>'s
philosophy than other languages, but he answers his own question by observing
that languages can evolve to satisfy their own requirements. That is, Hegel
could benefit from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> language not because <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> is intrinsically good
for the discussion of philosophy but because after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> of such discussion it
had developed appropriate words and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">philosophers</ENAMEX> could
understand them.

            In other words, when we say that languages or dialects are equal, we do not
mean that they are all equally able to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">concisely</ENAMEX> express every nuance at every
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>. We mean that they are equally capable of expressing any thought
necessary to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> of that language or dialect. Most educated English
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> are unable to understand medical jargon; that does not mean that
standard <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> is incapable of expressing complicated medical concepts. When
it is necessary, such concepts can be explained in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">laymen</TIMEX>'s terms, which may
not be as concise as medical jargon, but will do for the circumstances.
Likewise, the language of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hegelian</ENAMEX> philosophy is not standard <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX>--it is
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hegel</ENAMEX>'s language, and that language can be so difficult that even German
philosophy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> sometimes read <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hegel</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> translation.

            To take a very common illustration from <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>: Though the vocabulary of
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> is vastly larger even than other Western languages, there are many
simple concepts that have no one word to express them. If I am referring to my
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>, what word do I use? There isn't one. "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brother-in-law</ENAMEX>" is
ambiguous; it could refer to my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX>. And this is a very common
concept. Other languages, often regarded as more "primitive" than <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX>, have
highly evolved vocabularies for denoting family relationships, so that a single
word can denote, say, one's maternal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandfather</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX>. Does this mean that
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> is deficient? Well, it means that in the culture of these other
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">languages</ENAMEX>, the denotation of family relationships is more important than it is
in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>. But even in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> we can always say "my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX>."

            The number of words in a language is irrelevant, contrary to what one
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">respondent</ENAMEX> suggests. Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX>, even highly educated ones, use only a
relatively small proportion of the words available to them. (The entire
Shakespearean corpus contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 20,000</NUMEX> distinct words.) So even if it were
true that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AAVE</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brooklynese</ENAMEX> had fewer words than some other variety, it
wouldn't mean that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AAVE</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brooklynese</ENAMEX> are incapable of expressing
certain thoughts. Indeed, there are structures in nonstandard dialects that are
certainly more expressive than what is available in the standard dialect. One
respondent mentions "y'all," an excellent example--<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> used to make a
distinction between singular "thou" and plural "you," but now only <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern</ENAMEX>
varieties of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> are capable of this distinction without resorting to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">circumlocutions</ENAMEX>. Likewise, the use of "be" in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AAVE</ENAMEX> is what linguists called an
"aspect marker," indicating that the action is habitual: The sentence "He be
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">workin</ENAMEX>' " means "He habitually works"--i.e. "He has a job"--while "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">He</ENAMEX> (is)
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">workin</ENAMEX>' " means simply "At this moment he is working." This distinction is not
easy in standard <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX>.

            I'm running long, especially since I haven't had my <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX> yet, but I want
to make one last point. We are not saying that minority dialects should be
favored, or that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> of minority dialects should be prevented (or should
be discouraged) from learning standard speech. It is often true, as several
respondents observe, that in order to succeed in the mainstream world <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX>
must use a standard variety. But this goal is not necessarily shared by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> themselves. Dialects survive because <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> want to be part of a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">social</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, and this is often more important than other factors. The theory
that mass communication will eventually level all dialects ignores the fact
that not everyone wants to speak like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Jennings</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter Cronkite</ENAMEX>.

            Best,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesse</ENAMEX>

            P.S. The word "floccinaucinihilipilification" means "the estimation of
something as worthless." It's an <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">18 th</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">coinage</ENAMEX> that combines
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> prefixes meaning "nothing."
