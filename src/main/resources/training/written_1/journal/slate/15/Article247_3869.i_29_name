            Even before the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6 percent</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX>,
market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">watchers</ENAMEX> were anticipating a dip in the market--the so-called "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">October</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">curse</ENAMEX>." Does the stock market really perform worse during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX>? And, if so,
why?

            Anecdotal evidence supports the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">curse</ENAMEX>. The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1929</TIMEX> crash happened in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX>, as did the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8 percent</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one-day</TIMEX> drop in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1937, 1987</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Black Monday</ENAMEX>, and
the big correction in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>. In all, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> largest <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one-day</TIMEX> drops in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jones</ENAMEX> history have happened in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX>.

            But statistical analysis reveals a murkier picture. Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1928</TIMEX>, when the
DJIA began measuring the performance of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> leading stocks, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX> has produced
average <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</TIMEX> returns (calculated by dividing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each year's Oct. 31</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow</ENAMEX> level
by its <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Sep. 30</NUMEX> level) of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-0.21 percent</NUMEX>. While negative, these returns are not
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX>'s worst; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September</TIMEX> yield returns of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-0.39 percent and -1.19</NUMEX>
percent, respectively. And since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990, October</TIMEX> has ranked <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">seventh</NUMEX> out of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX>, with an average return of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">+0.36 percent</NUMEX>. Other indices are similarly
mixed: <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX> has historically been <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the worst month</TIMEX> for the Nasdaq Composite
Index, but ranks <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">seventh</NUMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Standard & Poor's</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX>.

            While <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX> has historically been a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">below-average month</TIMEX> for the stock
market, the "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">curse</ENAMEX>" is an exaggeration. Often, there are no major drops during
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX>. And in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1982 and 1998</TIMEX>, the DJIA increased <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 10 percent</NUMEX> for the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">month</TIMEX>.

            When the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow</ENAMEX> drops in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX>, Wall Street points to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> major factors.
First, many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> report their financial <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year-end</TIMEX> earnings in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX>. If a
company underperforms expectations <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early in the year</TIMEX>, the market is more
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">forgiving</ENAMEX>, since there is still time for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> to recover before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>'s
end. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the third and fourth quarters</TIMEX>, though, poor earnings reports often
cause a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>'s stock to fall (this helps explain <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX>'s drop in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX>
stock price after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>'s earnings announcement). Of course, the market
also reacts more strongly to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> beating expectations, so this may simply
explain <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX> volatility (and the frequency of big drops), rather than the
overall downward trend.

            <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, many mutual funds close their books at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of October</TIMEX>. In order
to ensure that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> fund performance appears strong, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> may engage in
"profit taking," or selling stocks that have increased in value. As with any
product, the increased number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sellers</ENAMEX> tends to drive down prices. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>,
some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> speculate that basic psychology plays a role in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX> declines.
While <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year's first few months</TIMEX> are a time of optimism, they say, the end of
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> is characterized by pessimism compounded by the onset of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> may therefore be less likely to make risky investments. (In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November</TIMEX> and
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December</TIMEX>, this effect could be counteracted by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">holiday</TIMEX> bonuses and efforts to
make investments before the end of the tax year.) And past crashes may make
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX> downturns more likely: Since they have left a psychological scar,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> may be especially skittish during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the month</TIMEX>.

            If the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX> stock slump were regular and predictable, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX>' rational
reactions would tend to counteract it. That is, if an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX> knew that stock
prices would fall <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each October</TIMEX>, he or she would view <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the month</TIMEX> as an
opportunity to buy into the market at lower prices. As <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> looked to
enter the market in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX>, they would push stock prices up. Evidence of the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX> slump is not strong enough for most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> to make decisions based
on this expectation. But <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX>, some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> did advise their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> to
look for good deals in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX>. And when the stock market recovered ground this
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX>, many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observers</ENAMEX> attributed the gain to bargain-hunting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">investors</ENAMEX>.
