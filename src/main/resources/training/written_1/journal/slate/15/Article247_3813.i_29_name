            <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Hello</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard</ENAMEX>:

            I wanted to go back to something you said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX>, as
it has been rattling around my brain <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">all night</TIMEX>. You noted an "immense divide
between wired-up, screwed-up <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> ... and a quieter <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> may
suffer far less from identity crises because they are trying to get by rather
than get ahead." I have already discussed the fact that "wired up" <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> is
far more extensive than its presumably "screwed up" epicenters. But now I want
to address the notion that one must be in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>, or the
equivalent, to be "getting ahead." That formulation strikes me as emblematic of
the very ornamental culture that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Faludi</ENAMEX> derides. For many of the people
battling it out in these places, "winning" or "getting ahead" means being
noticed by the others--on camera, in the news, in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX>, and so on. The
mentality of "others notice me, therefore I am" is quite appropriate if you are
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14 years old</TIMEX>, but pretty pathetic for a grown-up. This "ornamental culture" is
like a perpetual twilight of adolescence; it is a thwarted adulthood. For those
who exist only in the gaze of others, "getting ahead" may well mean achieving
more time at the center of attention, but that really gets them nowhere new,
and least of all "ahead." Maybe that explains <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Susan Faludi</ENAMEX>'s enigmatic visage
on the cover of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek</ENAMEX> --participating in the
ornamentation thing, but knowing better.

            The real challenge of "getting ahead" as an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult</ENAMEX> is
far more complex. It involves the work of forging an identity that has
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">coherence</ENAMEX> and integrity, whether or not anyone is looking. But adult
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX>, as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gilligan, Kegan</ENAMEX>, and many others have noted, does not stop
there with the achievement of an autonomous identity. It can also mean learning
that my humanity is larger than the roles I inhabit, and in the exploration of
my individuality I also, paradoxically, discover the possibility of a deeper
connection with many kinds of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. Autonomy is not an end in itself but a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">foundation</ENAMEX> for the ongoing work of individuation and real intimacy. These
triumphs of adulthood are hard won, and as you said about <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, they often
spring from darkness and grief. They always <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">spring</TIMEX> from engaging with the
messiness of real life.

            All over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>, and indeed all over the world, people
are "getting ahead," in this truer sense; they are not merely "getting by."
They are geologists and hospice <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> and emergency-room <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> and research
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> and lobstermen and forest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rangers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cooks</ENAMEX> and microbiologists and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mechanics</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">entrepreneurs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">programmers</ENAMEX> and small-business
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">veterinarians</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX>. They are in the hills of the
altiplano, caring for their land and their <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>. They are
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Brazilian</ENAMEX> rain forest, fighting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ranchers</ENAMEX> and government ineptitude. They
are in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East Timor</ENAMEX>, standing for independence. They are in all the quiet places
where the cameras do not roam, making love, making <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, making dinner, and
making a world. They are not hanging around making bombs and complaining about
lost dominance. Nor is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Trump</ENAMEX> their role model. They are too busy for
that. Too busy getting ahead.

            I am persuaded that the new economy already shows signs
of offering much more opportunity for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> to move beyond the conformist
pressures of the large <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">th -century</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX> and the fragmented identities of industrial society. I think this
emerging era will provide more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> with the possibility of becoming
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>, as it enables us to reintegrate work and life in many new rich and
varied patterns. (And by the way, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only about 20 percent</NUMEX> of those home <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> I
mentioned <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> are dedicated to telework.)

            Once again, hats off to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Susan Faludi</ENAMEX> for the
authenticity of her effort and the seriousness of her subject. Whether or not I
agree with her analysis, I do think that these times require a reexamination of
many century-old formulations, including masculinity and particularly the role
that gender has played in the maintenance of traditional economic models. May
the debate continue so that we can all, well, get ahead ...

            As ever,
Shoshana Zuboff
