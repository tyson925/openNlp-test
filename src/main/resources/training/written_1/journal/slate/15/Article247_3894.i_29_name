            Good <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Seth</ENAMEX>.

            In front of me are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> bottles of multicolored sports
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drinks</ENAMEX>. The only color I don't see is pink. The big <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gatorade, Powerade</ENAMEX>,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">All Sport</ENAMEX>, are all represented. The variations between brands are as
follows: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gatorade</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">110</NUMEX> milligrams sodium per serving, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Powerade and All Sport</ENAMEX>
have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55</NUMEX>. All <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sport</ENAMEX> is slightly carbonated. The other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> are not. Other than
that, the differences are all aesthetic. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Powerade</ENAMEX> has flashy graphics, is
saturated with dye, and has a more intense flavor. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gatorade</ENAMEX> is subtler, with
the classic orange thunderbolt design, and has generally more mild watery
flavors. (I bet, though, that their new "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Fierce" line--Fierce Melon, Fierce</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lime</ENAMEX>, etc.--which has stronger flavors, is meant to compete with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Powerade</ENAMEX>.) All
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sport</ENAMEX>'s design leans toward the low-budget and simple, and it's a touch sweeter
than the others, flavorwise.

            The flavor names are ridiculous: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Powerade</ENAMEX> has <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mountain</ENAMEX>
Blast, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jagged Ice</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Arctic Shatter</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gatorade</ENAMEX> has <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Alpine Snow, Riptide Rush</ENAMEX>,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Glacier Freeze</ENAMEX>. The new trend in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drinks</ENAMEX> seems to be away from the
traditional red-orange-yellow colors and fake-fruit flavors and toward the blue
end of the color spectrum and the dropping of all pretense of fruitiness.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gatorade</ENAMEX>'s "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frost</ENAMEX>" line sports semi-opaque blue, purple, and white <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drinks</ENAMEX>. But
these new flavors--especially the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Powerade</ENAMEX> flavors--are, I think,
too intense. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Powerade's Lemon Lime</ENAMEX> smells so
strongly like bathroom cleaner you think you're going to burn your nose
inhaling it, and it tastes the way I'd imagine bathroom cleaner would, too.

            Instead of chowing down on sports <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX> like I did for
our run across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Brooklyn Bridge</ENAMEX>, this time I drank a load of the sports
drinks before I ran. And I felt a lot better than I did with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX>. But the
many uncontrolled factors involved here (did I get a better night's sleep? Did
I feel better because I didn't have a brick of imitation <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">banana</ENAMEX> in my stomach?)
make it impossible to conclusively attribute my feeling better to the more
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rapid</ENAMEX> and effective hydration I was receiving from the sports <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drinks</ENAMEX>.
Nevertheless, I did feel better.

            The differences in prices among the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drinks</ENAMEX> were small.
Powerade was the most expensive at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5.37 cents</NUMEX> per ounce; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">All Sport</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.53</NUMEX>;
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gatorade</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.21</NUMEX>. In more understandable terms, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gatorade and All Sport</ENAMEX> were
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1.35 and $1.45</NUMEX>, respectively, for a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">32-ounce</NUMEX> bottle, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Powerade</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1.29</NUMEX>
for a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">24-ounce</NUMEX> bottle.

            After sampling everything on my smorgasbord of colored
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drinks</ENAMEX>, my favorite flavors ended up being the old fashioned Gatorade flavors:
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fruit Punch</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Orange</ENAMEX>. All <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sport</ENAMEX> came close--the barely there carbonation was
nice--but in the end it was just too sweet. Although I might be more likely to
drink <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">All Sport</ENAMEX> while sitting in front of the TV, when working out, the light,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">watery</ENAMEX>, slightly tangy old-school <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gatorade</ENAMEX> is much more appealing. The only
problem is the high sodium--there's no way I'll sweat enough to need those <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">110</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">milligrams Gatorade</ENAMEX> claims on its Web site that "the presence of sodium ...
<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">aids</ENAMEX> in stimulating fluid consumption." Is the idea to make you even thirstier
so you'll drink more? What a scam!

            So what did you think of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drinks</ENAMEX>? Are you worried at
all about the amount of artificial flavors and colors that you're
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ingesting</ENAMEX>?

            Yours,
Eliza
