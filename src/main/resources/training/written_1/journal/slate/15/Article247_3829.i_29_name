            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last month</TIMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Science</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientist</ENAMEX> wrote that the computer
industry is "in serious danger" of violating <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Moore's Law</ENAMEX>. What is he referring
to?

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moore</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Law</ENAMEX> is really just a prediction that the processing power of the
state-of-the-art computer chip will double <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every 18 months</TIMEX>. It's named after
computer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gordon Moore</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">co-founder</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intel Corporation</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1965</TIMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moore</ENAMEX> observed that since the invention of integrated circuits (or microchips)
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1959</TIMEX>, the number of transistors that a chip of constant surface area could
hold had doubled once <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every year or two</TIMEX>. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Integrated</ENAMEX> circuits are the basic
units of computer logic and memory, and transistors are the "on-off" switches
that allow digital information to be transmitted, processed, and stored. The
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more</NUMEX> transistors you can pack on a circuit, the more powerful the circuit
becomes.) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moore</ENAMEX> simply predicted that this pattern would continue.

            Even though it's not really a law, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moore</ENAMEX>'s prediction has held true for the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">past three decades</TIMEX>. In fact, its hallowed status has made it self-fulfilling:
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chipmakers</ENAMEX> and industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> now set their goals and forecasts based on
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moore</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Law</ENAMEX>. And because chip prices have decreased even as capacity has risen,
the computer processing power available to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> at a given price has
doubled even more quickly.

            Since <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moore</ENAMEX>'s Law depends on the continuous shrinking of transistors,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> generally agree that it will eventually be violated. Previous
predictions that it would break down have proved incorrect, and most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX>
expect <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moore</ENAMEX>'s Law to hold for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 10-15</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more years</TIMEX>. But the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Science</ENAMEX> article suggests that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moore</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Law</ENAMEX> may encounter physical limits
sooner. Transistors have already shrunk to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one five</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundredth</NUMEX> the width of a
human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hair</ENAMEX>. To adhere to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moore</ENAMEX>'s Law, within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five years</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineers</ENAMEX> would have to
create transistors that are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only a few dozen</NUMEX> atoms across--a feat that might be
impossible, since atomic movement is so difficult to predict. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Click</ENAMEX> here to read the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> '
non-technical piece on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Science</ENAMEX> article.) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Engineers</ENAMEX> are currently
investigating new materials and technologies that might allow <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moore</ENAMEX>'s Law to
survive this latest challenge.
