            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dear Ted</ENAMEX>:

            Looks like it's time to clear the dishes from this old breakfast table. I'll
endure the scurrying roaches long enough to say It's been a lot of fun
(although I don't usually have elephant dung with my oatmeal).

            I should have known I'd get myself in trouble by calling names of my
favorite editorial illustrators. I left out <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Burt Silverman</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe Ciardiello</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Cober</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Julian Allen</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the last two</TIMEX>, alas, having passed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX>). And
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ralph Steadman</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">King of Swing</ENAMEX>.

            About drawing ability, don't sweat it, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ted</ENAMEX>. Your work is so much better
drawn than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lurie</ENAMEX>'s that the subject shouldn't even be on the table. You
have what all great <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> of all disciplines need: self-knowledge. It is the
understanding of our own artistic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personalities</ENAMEX>, temperaments, and, yes,
limitations that enables us to shape an effective statement on the page. While
a burnt-out hack like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lurie</ENAMEX> sweats bullets trying to be <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Levine</ENAMEX> (and failing
every single solitary day of his long and lucrative life), excellent
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cartoonists</ENAMEX> figure out how to draw in a way that perfectly supports the
statement they're making. You mention <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thurber</ENAMEX>. How sublime he is! Those
drawings bring you right in. Somehow (and I don't know how) they cause you to
stop flipping and really look , and then, of course, you're reading the
story. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Tomorrow</ENAMEX> thing is interesting. He'd be out on his keister
without a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xerox</ENAMEX> machine. But who cares? The image matches the voice
wonderfully. And the voice is saying important things. Your work understands
how fast we're flipping through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX>. It brings us immediately to the
idea. Your understanding of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> is very keen; those lines hold the image and
grab our attention. So your cranky <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">left-</ENAMEX>of-irony point of view comes in loud
and clear. For God's sake, don't learn to draw.

            For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> I resisted The 
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Simpsons</ENAMEX> . I hated the drawings. It
seemed a cheap approach to animation. Plus it was on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fox Network</ENAMEX>, so, I
thought, how could this be worth the trouble to sit and watch it (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TV</ENAMEX> is a big
effort for me). Turns out, of course, it's, perhaps TV's greatest moment. All
the crappy drawing and "family situation comedy" is a ruse. It gets the masses
in the tent and then Groening lets them have it. It's powerful, experimental,
strangely committed. On top of that, there's very real and touching character
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX>. It is a work of unalloyed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genius</ENAMEX>. More than the work of my
favorite graphic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX>, this program will be the thing our cultural era will
be remembered for because he wrapped his message in such strategic cleverness
as to make it a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Saturn</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">rocket</ENAMEX> that blasts into every <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>. And the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">guy</ENAMEX> can't draw to save himself.

            I'll finish with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phil Harris</ENAMEX> (I know you've been waiting). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phil Harris</ENAMEX> was
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Benny</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">orchestra leader</ENAMEX> on radio. He was also married to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alice Faye</ENAMEX>, the
gorgeous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">star</ENAMEX> of many <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">th Century Fox</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">musicals</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Benny</ENAMEX>, in an
interview, said that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> always wrote <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harris</ENAMEX>' radio <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> as if
he'd just got out of bed having had great sex. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harris</ENAMEX>, on radio, is laid-back,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">flippant</ENAMEX>, casual, with a little buzz on. You could just see the cigarette.
Everyone knows a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> like this; someone so comfortable with himself that he
just doesn't give a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">f**k.</ENAMEX> And this, it occurs to me, is why <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Gore</ENAMEX> is a loser.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George W. Bush</ENAMEX>, you just know has great sex. He said to me <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX>, "Maybe
I'll see you in national politics; maybe I won't I have a cool life." <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX>? <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C'mon</ENAMEX>, great sex. He's a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">jock</ENAMEX>, could get all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> he wanted. He's
traveled everywhere, knows about life. Every movement is easy. He's comfortable
with himself. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Gore</ENAMEX> looks like a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> who broke his toe because the vibrator
fell out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX> cabinet when he opened it looking for a band-aid
because he cut his finger trying to undo his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>'s bra. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> don't think
these things, of course. But I think they perceive them subconsciously. If a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> is comfortable with himself, he'll be comfortable in the job. It's too bad,
though. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stevenson</ENAMEX> might have made an inspired <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>. Or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mondale</ENAMEX>. Or
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dukakis</ENAMEX>. Or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX>.

            But I don't think we'll get to find out.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Au</ENAMEX> revoir,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve</ENAMEX>
