            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chatterbox</ENAMEX> finally logged on to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metabolife</ENAMEX>'s "up yours, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20/20</NUMEX> "
Web site. As
explained in previous items (see "
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metabolife</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Lawyer Assures C'box He Won't Sue</ENAMEX>" and "
Metabolife: Read This! No, Wait, Don't Read This!"), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Metabolife</ENAMEX> felt
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ill</ENAMEX>-used by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20/20</TIMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arnold Diaz</ENAMEX> when he interviewed its chief executive
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike Ellis</ENAMEX>, about the safety and efficacy of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metabolife</ENAMEX>'s popular
herbal diet <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pills</ENAMEX>. So the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> put an unedited videotape of the interview
(made by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metabolife</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">technicians</ENAMEX>, with an audio feed from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX>) on a special
Web site and
invited <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> to compare that with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">20/20</ENAMEX> 's report, which has yet to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">air</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chatterbox</ENAMEX> believes the behavior of the press merits no less scrutiny than
the behavior of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Metabolife</ENAMEX>. Therefore, he declines to join <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX>
News in its whiny denunciation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metabolife</ENAMEX>'s attempt to turn the tables.
However, now that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chatterbox</ENAMEX> has examined <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metabolife</ENAMEX>'s annotated transcript of
the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20/20</NUMEX> interview (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chatterbox</ENAMEX> lacked the patience to download the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">video</ENAMEX>), he is ready to pronounce the opening round of this public-relations
battle ... a victory for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC News</ENAMEX>!

            Before proceeding, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chatterbox</ENAMEX> needs to state a few caveats. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) Chatterbox
went into this with no knowledge, and no opinion, about the safety and efficacy
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metabolife</ENAMEX>'s herbal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug supplement</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chatterbox</ENAMEX> knows a little more now
that he's read the transcript, but not enough to render a reliable judgment on
whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Metabolife</ENAMEX> is safe and effective. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chatterbox</ENAMEX> obviously can't judge
the fairness of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a 20/20</NUMEX> episode that hasn't aired yet; the best he can
do right now is try to evaluate whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diaz</ENAMEX>, conducted a
professional and responsible interview. Which (unless the unseen tape reveals
Diaz physically pummeling <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ellis</ENAMEX> while he asks his questions), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diaz</ENAMEX> seems to
have done.

            The bulk of the interview consists of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diaz</ENAMEX> asking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ellis</ENAMEX> in various ways
whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Metabolife</ENAMEX> is safe and effective. The form these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchanges</ENAMEX> mostly take
is a debate about whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Metabolife</ENAMEX>, in its labeling and its promotional
material, accurately presents what scientific study has found about the
product. Diaz keeps accusing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ellis</ENAMEX>, in effect, of exaggerating the assurances
given by the scientific community; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ellis</ENAMEX>, in turn, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diaz</ENAMEX> is misinterpreting
various scientific studies, or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">misstating</ENAMEX> who the lead <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientist</ENAMEX> on this or
that study was. Notes interjected by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metabolife</ENAMEX> into the transcript point out
that some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diaz</ENAMEX> cites have economic ties to rival diet
products.

            Though <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chatterbox</ENAMEX> won't attempt to referee the scientific questions, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diaz</ENAMEX> at
least gives the impression of being fairly well-informed , while
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ellis</ENAMEX> often gives the impression of being evasive . At <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> point,
for instance, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ellis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> flatly that certain language cited by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diaz</ENAMEX> declaring
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metabolife</ENAMEX> to be safe and effective is "not on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Metabolife</ENAMEX> Web page." But
later <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ellis</ENAMEX> concedes, "You know, to be honestly fair with you, I do not know
what our Web site looks like."

            Probably the most accessible part of the interview is when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diaz</ENAMEX> quizzes
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ellis</ENAMEX> about his criminal past:

            

               
                  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diaz</ENAMEX>: Now, you developed this product while you ... you developed the
product while you were on probation for a drug conviction.
               

               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ellis</ENAMEX>: That's correct.

            

            Here <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Metabolife</ENAMEX> interjects the following explanatory note: "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Nine years</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ago</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Ellis</ENAMEX> received <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five years</TIMEX> probation for the use of a telephone to
facilitate a drug trafficking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">offense</ENAMEX> committed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX> ."

            

               
                  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diaz</ENAMEX>: Now talk to me about that. You were a former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police officer</ENAMEX>, and
yet you got caught setting up and dealing methamphetamine .

               
                  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ellis</ENAMEX>: Well, it's correct I was a former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police officer</ENAMEX>, and it's correct
that I did receive probation for using a telephone to further a drug
transaction. And that's something I'm not proud of; I think that happening to
me is the nightmare of my life, and I've made it a point to kind of try to do
the right thing ever since that. It's not something I'm proud of.
               

               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diaz</ENAMEX>: How does a former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police officer</ENAMEX> get involved with running a
laboratory making illegal speed?

               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ellis</ENAMEX>: Well, I don't think I was running a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX>, I think that's a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">misconception</ENAMEX>. But I made a grave error, just a bad mistake on my part.

            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chatterbox</ENAMEX> predicts that this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> will end up airing in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">20/20</ENAMEX> broadcast. When asked to explain this "bad mistake," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ellis</ENAMEX>
elaborates:

            

               
                  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ellis</ENAMEX>: You know, it's one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that were involved in that, it's
a very personal issue with him; and why I got involved, he's like a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> to
me, he's like my best <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX>, and I allowed emotions to get in the way of
probably better judgment.
               

            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diaz then</ENAMEX> tells <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ellis</ENAMEX> that unsealed court records show "that you were
involved in a very large methamphetamine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lab</ENAMEX> manufacturing speed," but that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ellis</ENAMEX> pleaded to "a lesser charge" that was nonetheless a felony.

            

               
                  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ellis</ENAMEX>: Yes I did.
               

               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diaz</ENAMEX>: OK. So the key ingredient in the illegal drug speed is ephedrine;
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ephedrine</ENAMEX> is the key ingredient in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metabolife</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pills</ENAMEX> that you're making now.
Is that a coincidence?

            

            At this point, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metabolife</ENAMEX> interjects another explanatory note: A
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEA</ENAMEX>-approved <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lab</ENAMEX> found that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metabolife</ENAMEX> could not be converted into illegal
"speed" using the method published in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal of Forensic Sciences</ENAMEX> ,
Vol. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX>, No. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 1995</TIMEX>.
            

            Then the transcript proceeds to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ellis</ENAMEX>' response:

            

               
                  Well, when I designed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metabolife</ENAMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">those days</TIMEX> especially, I mean it was
known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ma huang</ENAMEX>. It's only recently has been where everybody became aware of
a lot of the active alkaloids in it. And that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Metabolife</ENAMEX>, specifically, has
been tested, and has been through rigorous testing through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEA</ENAMEX>--and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX>
certified <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratories</ENAMEX> to determine if in fact you could make methamphetamine
out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metabolife</ENAMEX>, it was concluded you could not do that.
               

            

            Score one badly needed blow for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ellis</ENAMEX>. But within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">moments</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diaz</ENAMEX> is up off the
ropes:

            

               
                  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diaz</ENAMEX>: ... [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX>]<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hy</ENAMEX> did you make the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who was convicted with you, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michael</ENAMEX>
Blevens, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>?
               

            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chatterbox</ENAMEX> predicts this question, and the following answer, will also make
the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20/20</NUMEX> broadcast:

            

               
                  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ellis</ENAMEX>: Well, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Blevens</ENAMEX> had his personal reasons why he got
involved, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Blevens</ENAMEX> is like a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> to me. I may not approve of a
lot of things a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> do--like my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, I would not approve of
certain things they do, but it doesn't stop you from loving them. I still love
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Blevens</ENAMEX>, he was raised like a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> with me, and I knew his mother,
especially, that was like a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> to me. And so, because of an incident that I
am just--you know, I made poor judgment also--that I'm not going to sit back
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> the real <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> might be.
               

            

            When asked by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diaz</ENAMEX> whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blevens</ENAMEX> still plays an active role in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Metabolife</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ellis</ENAMEX> says he hasn't for "<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">almost a year</TIMEX>."

            
               To summarize : <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Round</ENAMEX> one goes to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC News</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chatterbox</ENAMEX> will judge round
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20/20</NUMEX> airs its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metabolife</ENAMEX> story.
