            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dear Steve</ENAMEX>:

            Thanks for the encouragement to remain graphically
inept. I've always theorized that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cartoonists</ENAMEX>' drawing styles tend to suit
their temperament in the same way that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">singers</ENAMEX>' voices reflect their own
messages. I mean, what if <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnny Lydon</ENAMEX> had wanted to become a lounge <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">singer</ENAMEX>? Or
what if <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jewel</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> angry bitch with a bad hair day and a gun to use on any
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">guy</ENAMEX> she despised? So maybe my workaday "style" fits my cranky, as you put it,
outlook on life, I dunno. But I still would like to draw better, if for no
other reason but to like the way my stuff looks more when I see it in print.
Anyway, I suspect that maybe you're just trying to keep all the primo drawing
gigs with yourself ("And another thing, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rall</ENAMEX> can't draw for shit!" <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brodner</ENAMEX> told
his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> over <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drinks</ENAMEX> at the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Club</ENAMEX>).

            I'm glad you mentioned The
Simpsons , which is hands-down the best thing on TV ever. It's so great that
it's amazing that it was ever broadcast, much less promoted to the point that
it was permitted to gather an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> and eventually become successful. But
don't diss <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fox</ENAMEX>--I thought <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Married ...</ENAMEX>
with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Children</ENAMEX> (a live-action cartoon, really) was
pure <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genius</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X-Files</ENAMEX> , well, obviously is great,
though this business of preempting the season premiere in favor of <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">baseball</ENAMEX> is
stupid. Why can't <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">baseball</ENAMEX> games be played and broadcast during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the middle of</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX>, like in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the old days</TIMEX>? Any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">station</ENAMEX> that preempts news or other
prime-time programming for sports is irresponsible as hell. More to the point,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">spectator</ENAMEX> sports don't deserve coverage in any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX> so long as they're
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cramming comics</ENAMEX> into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> tiny page and skimping on the international coverage.
Why they merit TV coverage at all is beyond me, but running <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">baseball</ENAMEX> games on
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">nights</TIMEX> is sheer lunacy. Back to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matt Groening</ENAMEX>, I was initially
disappointed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Futurama</ENAMEX> , but now I realize that
it's not written for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>; it's really more for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>. The humor is more
downscale than The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Simpsons</ENAMEX> , which is fine for its
intended <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX>. I guess I'd have to ask a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX> whether they like it in order
for me to form a decent opinion.

            I like your <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phil Harris</ENAMEX> theory of sexual politics a lot.
It's true, you imagine that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">George Quincy</ENAMEX> is getting good sex--he certainly
appears relaxed for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> who signs more death warrants for his <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> in a day than I drink cups of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX>--but one wonders whether it's
with his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>. After what we've just been through post-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Monica</ENAMEX>, I certainly hope
so. Speaking of which, I know it's a little late, but I'd just like to say that
I still think <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> ought to have resigned <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 1998</TIMEX> that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX> story broke, and definitive proof that I'm right was the sinking of
the test-ban treaty that you like so much. No sitting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> would have
taken such a beating on a foreign-policy front without having lost all
political credibility to the extent that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Clinton</ENAMEX> did after being
impeached. He may have remained in office, but at what cost? He crippled <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX>'s
chances of defeating <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>--who as a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> is destined to lead <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> into
its next recession or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">depression</ENAMEX>, as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GOP</ENAMEX> always does--and he squandered two
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> of economic expansion during which really great programs might have been
enacted while we had the cash lying around. To those who say that private
consensual sex is nobody's business, they'd be right if not for the fact that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> perjured himself under oath, which is obviously impeachable, and more
important, unforgivable. Anyone who's ever sat in a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtroom</ENAMEX> and watched some
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dirtbag</ENAMEX> lie with a straight face knows of what I speak.

            As for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>, it's not too late to quit--dash off that
letter to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albright</ENAMEX> now, for Chrissake!

            If this is it for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Breakfast Table</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve</ENAMEX>,
then it's been a pleasure solving the world's problems with you. And if this is
not it, see you <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX>!

            Very truly yours,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ted</ENAMEX>
