            <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Hello</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard</ENAMEX>:

            Interesting thoughts indeed.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Susan Faludi</ENAMEX> says the old order is breaking down. I
agree. She says, "Oh, Dear," and I say "Hooray!!" The only problem I have is
that it's not breaking down nearly fast enough, due to vested interests,
institutional inertia, and lots of uncertainty about the new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> of wealth
creation that will replace the industrial leviathan. Gender has a role to play
here too. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Men</ENAMEX> have dominated the old order. Or perhaps it's more accurate to
say that a certain interpretation of masculinity based on dominance has imbued
the old order. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> feel comfortable with what they know, and it's not
clear that they will be able to enjoy the same kinds of perks from their
masculinity as wealth creation evolves toward new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next century</TIMEX>.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Fifty years</TIMEX> of social science have decried what that old order did to human
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">beings</ENAMEX>. A quick glance at my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bookshelf</ENAMEX> tells that story: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alienation</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Freedom</ENAMEX> , Class and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Conformity</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Hidden Injuries of Class</ENAMEX>
(brilliant, still), <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Organization Man</ENAMEX> ,
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lonely Crowd</ENAMEX> ... if we believe what we've been
saying, then we should all be celebrating.

            Why is this order breaking down? If you read <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Faludi</ENAMEX> the
answer seems to be something like--fickle and inept commercial interests
suddenly turned on to the financial benefits of treating <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> like paper
clips. This is simply wrong. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employers</ENAMEX> have always been arrayed in
something of a normal distribution, with some being quite progressive and
humane, offering great benefits and employment security, and some being right
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bastards</ENAMEX>. Most were somewhere in the middle, treating <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> like paper
clips when their balance sheet required them to do so. This situation has not
changed. Today, the really cool <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> that make the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fortune</ENAMEX> cover with their great family policies, benefits, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">security</ENAMEX>, employ at most <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 3 percent</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workforce</ENAMEX>. The normal
distribution still holds for the rest. Despite all the hype about the end of
loyalty, most of the studies conducted by labor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> show that the length
of time that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> spend with an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> and the number of changes they
make during their careers has not varied dramatically over the last
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">quarter-century</ENAMEX>. There was an increase in the churn rate for younger, less
experienced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1990s</TIMEX>, during the recession, but even that
appears to have moderated.

            So in what way are things changing? The short answer
here, I think, is "choice." The very success of the old order has created new
choices as well as--educated, informed-- <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> interested in new choices. The
electronic infrastructure--<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX>, PCs, the Internet, wireless
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">communications</ENAMEX>, satellites, etc.--is increasingly making it possible to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de</ENAMEX>-center from the old "epicenters," whether those are the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Angeles</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> or the old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> themselves in their
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">skyscrapers</ENAMEX> and industrial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX>. This means new choices for employment and new
choices for consumption. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> vote with their feet--and will increasingly.
They don't want to depend upon the old-style <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX> for their employment
or their consumption. They are seeking ways to exert more control over their
own lives and in the process to enhance the quality of their lives.

            For all the narcissism of those who are busy ringing
around the anthills of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> in order to be "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">winners</ENAMEX>" in
those loony hierarchies, the new boomtowns in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> are in places
recently regarded as pastureland: places like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Douglas</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colo.</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fayette</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Georgia</ENAMEX>, and yes, even <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Camden</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maine</ENAMEX>. Here the old definitions of what's global
and what's local no longer accurately describe the scene. In these new worlds,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are participating in the global economy while their lives remain
centered in their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> and their local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Nineteen ninety</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX>
was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first year</TIMEX> in which there was a net migration away from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> and
suburbs to so-called rural areas. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> now has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36.9 million</NUMEX>
home-office <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX>, which is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">36.5 percent</NUMEX> of the total <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">101.1 million</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">More than two-thirds</NUMEX> of those home <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> are
income-generating.

            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 18 th century</TIMEX>, most
commercial activity was based at home. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Craftsmen</ENAMEX> had their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> out back.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Merchants</ENAMEX> met <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> in their formal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parlors</ENAMEX>. But in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19 th century</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> were plucked out of their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> to go to work in
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factories</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>. Perhaps as a way to displace their collective grief,
they decided that the workplace was really important and what went on at home
... well, that newly feminine world was at best a distant <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>. The only guy
who was allowed to work from home without being regarded <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">suspiciously</ENAMEX> was the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>, who still conducted business in his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>. Places like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maine</ENAMEX>
reunite the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18 th century</TIMEX> with the
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">21 st</TIMEX> . You're right, it's not like living in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">York</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>. That's the whole point! And there are vast numbers of
educated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who can now free themselves from the hegemony of the old
"epicenters" to live the life they want without sacrificing their participation
in the global economy.

            So where does this leave the "masculinity crisis"? It
brings us right back to "choice." The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> making these new choices are the
ones forcing the breakdown of the old order. Yes, it's doing plenty to make
itself vulnerable, but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> based on the old industrial model are
simply not the first choice of an increasing number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who work and
consume. The new path they are forging is still in its infancy, but unlike the
edges of the stream that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Susan Faludi</ENAMEX> chose to shine her lights on, these are
the trends on which I place my bets for the future. For the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> who are making
these new choices, I don't believe there is a masculinity crisis but rather a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">liberation</ENAMEX> from an identity constrained by the "I am what I do" and the "I am
my status on the totem pole" mentality that dominated the emotional lives of
most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 20 th century</TIMEX>. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> are
excited about carving out a wider individuality in which they can develop and
enjoy a more spacious and multifaceted sense of self. For those who continue to
pursue the more traditional masculine identity, there is no crisis, but rather
denial. They will work to keep those identities intact until something happens
in their personal or professional lives that profoundly challenges their sense
of meaning. Only then will they choose to change. (I loved the way Faludi
showed Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stallone</ENAMEX> teetering on this choice. Unfortunately, he didn't know
very much about choosing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> capable of a commitment to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> he could
become, rather than the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> he had been.) You called the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Faludi</ENAMEX> interviewed
"losers." It's a hard word, but there is truth there. They are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">losers</ENAMEX> because
the old identity is foreclosed to them while the new choices don't appear to be
accessible. And it is precisely for this reason that, however important their
stories may be, they do not provide a basis for generalizing about the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">masculinity</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>.
