            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dear Seth</ENAMEX>,

            My quads are doing quite well, thanks. And that's a very good question you
raise about whether or not these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX> are any better than regular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX>, because
from the outside, they look like treats. The crackly foil wrappers, the
tempting names like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chocolate Chip Peanut Crunch</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wild Berry</ENAMEX>. This
deceptively <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yummy</ENAMEX> packaging makes what you find inside even more disappointing.
In general they are extrusions of jaw-tiringly chewy, chemical-smelling
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">waxiness</ENAMEX>. Likewise with sports <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drinks</ENAMEX>. Their names (<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Arctic Shatter</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frost</ENAMEX>)
promise limitless refreshment. But when you drink them, your first thought is
"Who put too much <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Kool-Aid?</ENAMEX>"

            So why eat this stuff? Are sports <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drinks</ENAMEX> an improvement on a
balanced diet and plain old <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>? Or are they just another piece of gear, like
an expensive running watch that looks cool but won't get you to the finish line
any faster. According to a dietician I spoke with, the garden variety athlete
has no need for either sports <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drinks</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX> are, in general
"glorified <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">candy bars</ENAMEX>," and if you read the label, they often list
high-fructose <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">corn syrup</ENAMEX> as their <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ingredient</ENAMEX>. A few <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX> don't. She
singled out the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Clif Bar</ENAMEX> as having a good balance of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, carbohydrates,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fats</ENAMEX>, as well as high <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber</ENAMEX>. She also said one thing to look for was a
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40-30-30</NUMEX> ratio of carbs to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fats</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. Eating nutrients in this ratio is
supposed to keep your blood-sugar levels in check--if you load up on sugars and
carbs with no <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fat</ENAMEX>, your blood-sugar levels spike and then drop,
leaving you feeling tired.

            What about the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drinks</ENAMEX>? There are a few reasons why sports <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drinks</ENAMEX> are
supposedly better than <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) The presence of carbs--<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 6 to 8</NUMEX>
percent--supposedly speeds your absorption of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fluids</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) The carbs will help
you stay energized while you work out. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) They taste good so you drink more
than you would plain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>. On the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> point, if you keep sucking down the
water before and during your workout, the speed of the absorption shouldn't
matter. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> point may well be valid, but the question is, would it be a
noticeable difference? (We'll see after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">tonight</TIMEX>'s run.) And on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> point,
I say, tastes good? Depends on whom you're talking to. But in general the
drinks do have an edge up on plain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>.

            One long-distance runner I spoke with said he relied on sports <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX> for
refueling during long runs, and that the taste and texture become irrelevant
when you are incredibly hungry and tired. This touches on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> important points.
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX> of all, this type of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> is not meant for someone who jogs <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a few miles</NUMEX>
or goes to an aerobics <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> a few times a week. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX> are high in calories,
with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Experimental</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Applied Science Myoplex Plus Deluxe Precision</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nutrition Bar</ENAMEX> chocolate flavor topping the list at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">340</NUMEX> calories and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">7 grams</NUMEX> of
fat--not that far from a Snickers <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX>. A competitive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">athlete</ENAMEX> needs this kind of
fat and calories, but most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> get more than enough in the rest of their
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diet</ENAMEX>. What this boils down to is if you're training for a marathon or working
out twice a day you may benefit from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drinks</ENAMEX>. But for your average
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">jogger</ENAMEX>, they're pointless.

            As for the merits of individual bars we tried before our run, they ranged
from almost good (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Powerbar's Harvest</ENAMEX> was like a bad granola <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX>, which for a
sports <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX> is excellent) to the truly horrible. I completely agree with your
assessment of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ironman Nutrition Bar</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Cookies 'N Cr√®me</ENAMEX>. Here I quote from
my notes, expletives deleted: "Taste <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Texture 0</ENAMEX> [out of a possible <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>].
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Disgusting</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vile</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Powdery</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chalky</ENAMEX>. Distinct non-chocolate chemical smell. Gag
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">reflex</ENAMEX> hit." I did not spit it out, though. Which may explain the intense
nausea I felt on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> leg of our run <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">last night</TIMEX>. Although we ate them as
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">directed</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 minutes</TIMEX> before exercising), they churned in my stomach with
disturbing violence. It wasn't until I released <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> massive belches (each
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">smelling</ENAMEX> strongly of false <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">banana</ENAMEX>) that I was able to settle into the run and
feel halfway normal. And I trace that false <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">banana</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nature</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plus</ENAMEX>
Spiru-tein <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">High Protein Energy Meal Banana</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Yogurt Coated Bar</ENAMEX>, which, although
it ranked decently in terms of taste and texture going down, was no treat
during the run.

            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tomorrow</TIMEX>, let's get into the specifics of which <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drinks</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX> are the best
and worst.

            Yours,
Eliza
