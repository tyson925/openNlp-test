            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judith Shulevitz</ENAMEX>'s article, "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Evolutionary</ENAMEX>
Psychology's <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Anti-Semite</ENAMEX>," is so outrageous a piece of yellow journalism that I
am surprised that a prominent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> like 
                  Slate
                would run it.
It bears about as much semblance to what I've written as a creationist tract
attacking evolution bears to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Darwin</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Origin of Species</ENAMEX> . It is so
outrageous one almost yearns for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> laws on libel so that I could force
her to prove her claims, such as that I am "evolutionary psychology's
anti-Semite" or that my ideas about <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> "represent the broadest, ugliest, and
most vicious anti-Semitism passing for scholarship in this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>." Some
of her statements are simply overly general, others simply false, while others
are incomplete or take my thoughts entirely out of context. In general
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shulevitz</ENAMEX> fails to even once indicate that I have adduced a great deal of
evidence for my claims and that I have developed a fairly elaborate theory
based on evolutionary biology and evolutionary social psychology.

            I want to thank <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judith Shulevitz</ENAMEX> for her report on
how business <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> makes <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> feel inadequate. It's always been my goal to make
other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, regardless of their sex, feel less adequate. This makes me feel
bigger and better, no matter how I'm actually doing. The news that I am "laying
waste to an entire generation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>" exceeds my greatest ambition in this
regard. Here I thought they were just a bunch of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">losers</ENAMEX>. Instead, I now
understand it's my fault.

            As I see it, they have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> choices. They can drop
out of the entire rat race and become <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folk singers</ENAMEX> or something, or they can
belly up to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX> and play in the real world where money is generally the
accepted way we keep score. If they're tired of feeling inferior to the latter
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">task</ENAMEX>, I highly recommend my new book, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">What Would Machiavelli Do</ENAMEX>? (buy it
here),
which might not be germane to this discussion, but will help me make more
money, which is, of course, one of my most important resolutions.

            Thanks for mentioning me in this august setting.
And anyone who reads my stuff without knowing I am frequently attempting to
achieve irony should probably feel as inadequate as they do.

            As the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gersh Kuntzman</ENAMEX> mentioned in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s
"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Breakfast Table</ENAMEX>" on the tabloids, I feel I must object to the glowing review
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tim Carvell</ENAMEX> gave me (I believe he called it "the magic of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gersh Kuntzman</ENAMEX>").

            Never forget that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gersh Kuntzman</ENAMEX> is a hack of the
highest tabloid order. Sure, his "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">MetroGnome"</ENAMEX> column (every <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX>) is the best
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, but the fact that he can spin dross like the retirement of a <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Plaza</ENAMEX>
doorman into <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX> does not mean he deserves awards or even praise.

            Job offers, however, are another issue.

            Thanks for reading.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Timothy Noah</ENAMEX> has lied--by omission.

            Yes, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry Klayman</ENAMEX> once sued his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>. I'm
certain <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chatterbox</ENAMEX> knows why, and you owe it to your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> to tell them: Mr.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Klayman</ENAMEX> sued his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> (successfully) to recover money that she and her
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband embezzled</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Klayman</ENAMEX>'s maternal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandmother</ENAMEX>.

            Altogether a different story, eh?

               I don't get what's
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">revolutionary</ENAMEX> about giving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> control over data about them. Some don't care
much about data about them. Others do. But that's the benefit of a property
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX>--<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> can be different, and the system can respect their differences.
It is always the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>'s role to establish property regimes. Even my
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antagonist</ENAMEX> in "The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Book Club</ENAMEX>," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard A. Epstein</ENAMEX>, argues that. So why not
property to protect this, if it will help assure more control over private
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>?

            

            But that's just my point--we already have property
rights in our personal data. No website can steal my data unless I voluntarily
agree to deal with that website. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> will deal with any website
regardless of privacy practices. Others will choose to deal only with websites
that establish privacy guarantees. The market, in other words, is already
working to accommodate consumer preferences and maximize social welfare with
only minimal intrusion by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>.

            A property right in our personal data? I don't know
what you mean. Of course, a web site is not allowed to break into your house
and read your diary. That's because of the law of trespass, not a law giving
you a property right to personal data. If you go to a web site, it can take
information about where you were, where you look, what kind of machine you use,
how long you browse, what your <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IP</ENAMEX> address is, it can coordinate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cookies</ENAMEX> with
other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> to figure out who you are, it can share information with that other
site.
