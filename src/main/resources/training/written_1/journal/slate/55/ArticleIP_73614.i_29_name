            Here
is how we spend <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the first half-hour</TIMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX>:

            Each
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning between 7 and 7:30</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tallulah</ENAMEX> begins to sing. She's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">only 8 months old</TIMEX>,
so she doesn't know any words. Still, she sounds as if she is practicing her
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">scales</ENAMEX>. I crawl out of bed and tumble downstairs to turn on the heat, rigged by
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> handyman so that it cannot run for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">more than about 12 hours</TIMEX> on end
without busting. I then clean up the mess invariably left by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vegas</ENAMEX> on the
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen floor</ENAMEX>--one of several evil new tricks she has picked up from the local
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX>--and toss her out into the garden. For a minute or so I watch through the
window to make sure she doesn't get any ideas about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Camembert</ENAMEX>. Like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">French</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, we now keep our <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">smelly cheeses</ENAMEX> in planting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pots</ENAMEX> outside. Imprisoned in
the refrigerator, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Camembert</ENAMEX> still had the power to stink up the entire
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">house.</ENAMEX> I'd open the door to grab a cold <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drink</ENAMEX> and be driven backwards by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">odor</ENAMEX>; a minute later, whoever was on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX> would shout in panicky
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tones</ENAMEX>, "Shut the fridge! Shut the fridge!" Relations with the cheese had
reached the point where one of us had to go.

            Once
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vegas</ENAMEX> is past the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Camembert</ENAMEX>, I turn and race <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">upstairs</ENAMEX> to snatch <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tallulah</ENAMEX> from
her crib before she stops singing and becomes outraged. Coming up the stairs, I
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">sing "Old McDonald Had a Farm</ENAMEX>." On his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">farm</ENAMEX> he had a rooster, I assume.
"<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Cock-a-doodle-</ENAMEX>do" is the signal for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tallulah</ENAMEX> to reach out with her arms and be
lifted from her crib. Rising, she smiles and kicks her feet as if something
really great is about to happen. I try not to disappoint. Together, we draw the
curtains on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX>-floor windows and peer up at the back of the crepuscular
neighboring apartment <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> to see if any <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are doing anything
particularly <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>. They are: sleeping. This is a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> of vampires; our
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> are empty <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">each morning until nearly 10:00</TIMEX>. "Coo," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tallulah</ENAMEX> says, after
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a minute</TIMEX> of staring at the old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>, then swivels and tosses her warm
little arms around me in her version of a bear hug.

            As we
move to the changing table the mood shifts. The moment she is laid on her back,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tallulah</ENAMEX> loses her love for me and becomes as impatient as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">race-car</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">driver</ENAMEX>
waiting for the tires to be changed. To keep her still enough to be unwrapped,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cleaned</ENAMEX>, and then wrapped again, I must find ever more exotic ways to trick her
into thinking something worth paying attention to is about to happen, right
here, in her own <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedroom</ENAMEX>. She never falls for the same trick twice. This
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX>, for instance, I danced the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Parisian Trash Bag Dance</ENAMEX>--a performance she
watched less with amusement than with a kind of morbid fascination. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Parisian Trash Bag Dance</ENAMEX> involves grabbing one of the giant blue trash bags
they sell at the local market and swishing it back and forth over my head
alluringly, while swaying my hips, like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salom√</ENAMEX>© charming <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Herod</ENAMEX>. Once <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tallulah</ENAMEX> is
mesmerized, I am able to remove one hand from the bag and do the dirty work,
dancing all the while. A moment's pause in the entertainment and she's flipping
herself onto her stomach, in a suicidal attempt to vault sideways off the
changing table.

            The
diaper changed, I grab <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tallulah</ENAMEX>, put her under my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> like a <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">football</ENAMEX>, duck
beneath the low staircase ceiling, and plunge down the narrow, unbelievably
steep stairs to our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedroom</ENAMEX>. There, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> sleeps. There, for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tallulah</ENAMEX>, is
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bliss</ENAMEX>. She raises her arms and cheers and kicks up such a delighted fuss that I
am reminded all over again what a dull pleasure I am to my own <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>. I am the
warm-up act. The featured attraction, inured to her own importance, reaches up
from under her covers and drags <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tallulah</ENAMEX> under the covers.

            Sadly, there is hardly a
moment to spare on self-pity. By now there is the most unbelievable ruckus
coming from outside. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX>, somehow already possessed of a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX>'s sense
of her rights, is busy breaking down the door with her head. Sometimes, for
fun, I open it just as she is about to strike again and she goes flying across
the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen</ENAMEX> floor like a vaudeville <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">comedian</ENAMEX> in a skit, crashing into the
opposite wall.
