                  From <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dusk 'Til Shawn</ENAMEX>.
                Which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Yorker</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staffer</ENAMEX> loved Mr.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Shawn</ENAMEX> the most? Despite what other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biographers</ENAMEX> might have you believe,
it was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ralph Treadwell</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The New Yorker</ENAMEX> 's longtime <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>-shift guard,
whose loyalty to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shawn</ENAMEX> ran deepest. Though the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> never met, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treadwell</ENAMEX> would
often pass <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the long, quiet hours</TIMEX> in the great <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>, poring over Mr.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shawn's</ENAMEX> marked-up manuscripts of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Yorker</ENAMEX> pieces. It was there, he
says, that he met his "only true <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hero</ENAMEX>" and began a lifelong love affair with
copy editing.

            

               
                  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Shawn</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Man of Letters</ENAMEX>.
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dolores Farber</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minnesota</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">housewife</ENAMEX>, corresponded with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shawn</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">over 30 years</TIMEX> through <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> wars,
through <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> presidential <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administrations</ENAMEX>, and through Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shawn</ENAMEX>'s entire
tenure as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Yorker</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX>. After a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10-year</TIMEX> silence, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Farber</ENAMEX> has finally
come forward to publish <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> pages of their hitherto secret correspondence. In
letter after letter Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shawn</ENAMEX> gracefully responds to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Farber</ENAMEX>'s lengthy missives
of life, love, and loss with reassuring replies, always beginning with the
familiar greeting, "We regret that we are unable to use the enclosed
material."

            

               
                  I Barely Remember Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shawn</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Yorker</ENAMEX>. She was only
in the typing pool for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three weeks</TIMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the winter of 1964</TIMEX>, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ethel Witcomb</ENAMEX>
remembers it as though it were <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX>. Sort of. She vividly recalls what
time she clocked in (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:30 a.m.</TIMEX>) and how much she paid for lunch at the Tastee
Coffeeshop on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">West 43 rd</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2.75</NUMEX>), but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> will find that she's a
bit vague on other facts and details, when she writes, for example, "I think
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shawn</ENAMEX> was the bald <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>. And he was short. Yeah, I'm almost positive he was
short. He smelled sweet, too ... like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacon</ENAMEX>. Best-smelling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> at
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Esquire</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shawn</ENAMEX>."

            

               
                  <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Shawn But Not Forgotten</ENAMEX>.
                Most <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">New Yorker</ENAMEX> ites knew Mr.
Shawn for his thoughtful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">repose</ENAMEX>, but the old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fellow</ENAMEX> could enjoy a good joke
from time to time. Mail-room <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Letty</ENAMEX> recalls that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shawn</ENAMEX> would
occasionally beckon him into his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> and, with a smile, offer a dry remark
about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yankees</ENAMEX> or the weather. Always <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to reciprocate, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Letty</ENAMEX> would
frequently sneak his mail cart up behind the aging <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shawn</ENAMEX> in the office <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">halls</ENAMEX>,
snap his butt with a rubber band, and yell, "Special delivery for ya,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shawnsy</ENAMEX>."

             

            

               
                  Outside Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shawn</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Yorker</ENAMEX>. To <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Yorker</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shawn</ENAMEX> was a brilliant, commanding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX>, whose pen could make a
phrase sparkle on the page. Not so to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who sold him his candied nuts.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack O'Rourke</ENAMEX>, who saw Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shawn</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nearly every day</TIMEX> from his <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cart</ENAMEX> outside the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Yorker</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>, remembers him as a cold, taciturn <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>, who rarely
said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than</TIMEX>, "A bag of nuts, please," or "I think I'll have some of those
tasty nuts."

            

               
                  Below Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shawn</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Yorker</ENAMEX>. The novelists,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalists</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">thinkers</ENAMEX> whose prose filled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shawn</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Yorker</ENAMEX> spent
much of their days roaming the office <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">halls</ENAMEX>, striking up spirited discussions
of literature or current affairs. But for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tony Gerwitz</ENAMEX>, whose accounting firm
occupied the floor immediately below the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX>, the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">era</TIMEX> was marked only by a
loud, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">unceasing</ENAMEX> trudging overhead. "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Intellectuals</ENAMEX> are all well and good,"
writes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gerwitz</ENAMEX> in his memoir, "but when they're stomping around above you all
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">day</ENAMEX>, it becomes hard to balance the books."

            

               
                  Inside Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shawn</ENAMEX>.
                A <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fantastic Voyage</ENAMEX> -style fantasy about
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">New Yorker</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> who feel so strongly about Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shawn</ENAMEX> that they
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">miniaturize</ENAMEX> themselves and have themselves injected into the great <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX>'s
bloodstream. By traveling up into his brain, they discover the awesome secret
of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shawn</ENAMEX>'s editing prowess. The book ends before the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> discover the
answer, but there will, we are told, be a sequel.
