            The papers of the late <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kingman Brewster Jr.</ENAMEX>, who
was <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yale</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the '60s and '70s</TIMEX>, include a letter from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">E. Alden</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dunham III</ENAMEX>, a former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of admissions at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Princeton</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dunham</ENAMEX> argued that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ivy League</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">universities</ENAMEX> were overemphasizing the importance of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SAT</ENAMEX> scores. For
example, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dunham</ENAMEX> wrote, consider a recent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Princeton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">graduate</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX>.

            "Here is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> who graduated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Magna Cum Laude</ENAMEX> in
history, the greatest <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">basketball</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">player</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ivy Colleges</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rhodes Scholar</ENAMEX>,
probably a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Missouri</ENAMEX> someday-and all with a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">485</NUMEX> verbal <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SAT</ENAMEX>!"

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Bradley</ENAMEX>, the
thinking presidential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX>, scored a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">485</NUMEX> verbal on his <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SAT</ENAMEX>? That's lower
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">than George W. Bush</ENAMEX>, the allegedly slow<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">-witted</ENAMEX> presidential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX>. As
reported recently in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The New Yorker</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> got an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SAT</ENAMEX> verbal score of
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">566</NUMEX>.

            So what conclusions should we draw? The important
conclusions aren't about whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX> is really smart or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> is really
dumb. They're about ways in which these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> are actually similar. Above all,
both of them are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">beneficiaries</ENAMEX> of affirmative action. A <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">566</NUMEX> verbal would not
have gotten you into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yale</ENAMEX> Class of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1968</TIMEX>, especially with mediocre
prep-school grades, if you weren't also the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX>-and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandson</ENAMEX>, for good
measure-of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yale</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alumnus</ENAMEX>. Likewise a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">485</NUMEX> verbal wouldn't get you into the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Princeton</ENAMEX> Class of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1965</TIMEX>, if you weren't also a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">star</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">basketball</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">player</ENAMEX>.

            By the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time Bradley</ENAMEX> applied to college in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early '60s</TIMEX>, selective <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> such as
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Princeton</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yale</ENAMEX> viewed themselves as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intellectual</ENAMEX> training grounds, not the
clubby enclaves of previous times. In this new era, a score below <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> on either
the verbal or math section of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SAT</ENAMEX> normally meant rejection. A <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1960 New</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yorker</ENAMEX> article described the case of an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African-American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">applicant</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yale</ENAMEX>
who was valedictorian and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of his high-school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> and a stellar
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">athlete</ENAMEX> to boot. His application was rejected-because his <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">488 SAT</ENAMEX> average
"would certainly be the lowest in the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yale</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX>." But the cutoff point
was more flexible for top <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">athletes</ENAMEX>, for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alumni</ENAMEX> "legacies," and starting in the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late '60s</TIMEX>, for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minorities</ENAMEX>.

            This leads to the following non-multiple-choice question
for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>: If you got into an Ivy League <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">college</ENAMEX> for reasons other
than "qualifications"-narrowly defined as grades and test scores-what is so
terrible about bending the same rules on behalf of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African-Americans</ENAMEX>? <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX>
would probably have an easier time with this question than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>, because as a
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrat</ENAMEX> he is not required to believe that "reverse discrimination" is
necessarily a terrible thing, and because athletic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">talent</ENAMEX> can plausibly be seen
as a legitimate aspect of "merit," while choosing a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> who went to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yale</ENAMEX>
cannot. But both examples undercut the argument against affirmative action.

            The examples of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bradley</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> also illustrate the fallacy of taking the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SAT</ENAMEX> as a measure of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intelligence</ENAMEX> or much of anything else-let alone of qualification to be
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. This is not because <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX> scored worse than
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>, but because both have led successful lives and are patently better
qualified for the presidency than many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> with higher scores.

            Of course, any analysis
of individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SAT</ENAMEX> results must be taken with a grain of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>
sat for the test in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the days</TIMEX> before score-raising courses like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kaplan</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Princeton Review</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SAT</ENAMEX> has been "recentered" in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX>, boosting
overall scores by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to a hundred</NUMEX> points. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX>, knowing he would be offered
athletic scholarships at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozens</NUMEX> of non-Ivy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>, may not have taken the test
seriously. And in any case, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX> actually scored quite respectably
when considered apart from the lofty standards of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ivy Leaguers</ENAMEX>. Both were
probably in the top <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> of all test-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">takers</ENAMEX> and would have been in the top
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">quarter</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">at least</NUMEX>) if the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SAT</ENAMEX> had been administered to all high-school
seniors.

            All the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SAT</ENAMEX> even purports to measure is likely <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">first-year</TIMEX>
college grades. Indeed, the test admirably predicted the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">freshman year</TIMEX> academic
difficulties of both <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>. While <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> remained mired in a
"<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gentleman</ENAMEX>'s C" groove for the duration of his undergraduate <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX> was
able to pull himself out of his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">first-year</TIMEX> struggles by dint of hard effort and
went on to an honors degree and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rhodes</ENAMEX> scholarship.

            Judging from their undergraduate careers alone, you
might well argue that the examples of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Bradley</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George W. Bush</ENAMEX>
illustrate a subtler point about affirmative action than mere thumbs-up or
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">thumbs-down</ENAMEX>. That is, affirmative action is more likely to succeed when it
takes into account personal qualities like drive and motivation, which may not
be captured on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SAT</ENAMEX>. Affirmative action is likely to fail when it is merely
a special preference bestowed upon those who have the right <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>, whether
"right" means educational pedigree or skin color.

            Even <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four decades later</TIMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX>'s appeal as a presidential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX>-contrary to some of his own
campaign slogans-is not that he was ever the epitome of effortless cerebral and
athletic superiority but that he has made the most of his talents. No test,
whether it takes the form of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SAT</ENAMEX> or a pop quiz on foreign affairs, is
conclusive proof of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>'s potential. Scores alone cannot be the sole basis
for making decisions about college admissions, hiring decisions, or
presidential elections. Affirmative action (even for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">athletes</ENAMEX> and preppies)
sometimes has a place in this land of <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> chances, where anyone can grow up
to be <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Bradley</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George W. Bush</ENAMEX> ought to know.
