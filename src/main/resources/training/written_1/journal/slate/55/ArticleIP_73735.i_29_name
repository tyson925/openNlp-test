            Online
voting is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">killer app</ENAMEX> of Net politics. The prospect of e-voting is
enthralling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalists</ENAMEX> (including 
                  Slate
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> and ), causing
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> to fret about digital signatures, and inspiring endless speculation
about how online ballots will eventually revolutionize politics. It is the big
idea that will change voting a huge amount someday.

            But a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">startup</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Newvoter</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX> has a little
idea that could change voting a small amount <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">now</TIMEX>. Its online voter registration
application could boost <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voter turnout</ENAMEX> and save grass-roots <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates money</ENAMEX> and effort.

            Online
voter registration, at this point, isn't quite what it sounds like. You cannot
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">register</ENAMEX> to vote online. The concern about digital signature verification that
is delaying online voting prevents online registration as well. What you can do
now, however, is register to register online. If you are a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">resident</ENAMEX>,
for example, you can go to a state Web site and complete the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> voter
registration application . After you complete the online application,
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> mails you a voter registration form with your information already
filled in. You sign the form and return it to your county election <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supervisor</ENAMEX>.
It's not quite point-and-click registration, but it does save <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> a trip to
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">post office</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> of motor <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicles</ENAMEX>. (Several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>,
including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Onlinedemocracy</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Election</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX>, want to sell such online
registration services to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>.)

            
Ultimately, online voter registration (even in its current form) is most
promising not because it saves time and money for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX>,
though it does. Online registration really serves those who conduct voter
registration drives. Grass-roots <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>, political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parties</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> routinely spend enormous sums of money and time on voter
registration drives without any guarantee that they are helping their cause.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Organizations</ENAMEX> that sign up <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> can't stay in touch with them, can't remind
the newly registered to vote, and can't ensure that the new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> will
remember their cause if they do vote. A voter registration drive is
"high-maintenance, it's labor-intensive, it's high-effort," says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark Strama</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">co-founder</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">CEO</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newvoter</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">com</ENAMEX>. "And, typically, after you register someone
to vote in the field, you lose touch with them."

            
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newvoter</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX> proposes to change that. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> offers itself as a kind of
online registration <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">middleman</ENAMEX>. Instead of conducting its own voter registration
campaign, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>-let's say, for convenience's sake,
Greenpeace-buys <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Newvoter</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX>'s application and puts it up on its own home page.
Any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> who visits the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greenpeace</ENAMEX> Web site will be encouraged to register to
vote.

            The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>'s application, which is currently available at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the Rock</ENAMEX> the Vote
site for what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Strama</ENAMEX> calls a
"test run," follows the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> model described above, except that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newvoter</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX>'s online application form can be used for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> and the
District of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX>. (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mississippi</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Hampshire</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Dakota</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wyoming</ENAMEX>
are the exceptions.) After completing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newvoter</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX>'s online form, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> are
mailed a printed registration form and an envelope addressed to their local
election <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>. They proofread it, sign it, add a stamp, and drop it in the
mail.

            
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newvoter</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX>'s innovation is to keep track of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">registrants</ENAMEX>. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenpeace</ENAMEX>
registers a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voter</ENAMEX> at a concert or on a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">campus</ENAMEX>, it loses touch with her
immediately. But if she registers on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Greenpeace</ENAMEX>'s Web site, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Newvoter</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Greenpeace</ENAMEX> can stay in contact with her. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Five days</TIMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newvoter</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX> mails the
official registration form to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voter</ENAMEX>, she receives an e-mail reminding her
to look for the form and noting that she is not registered to vote until it is
signed and returned. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Six weeks</TIMEX> before the election, an e-mail arrives asking
her if she plans to be in town for the election and providing instructions for
acquiring an absentee ballot. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">One week</TIMEX> before the election, she receives a
customized get-out-the-vote e-mail. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newvoter</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX> will also allow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> to join
a mailing list sponsored by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX>-the reminder e-mails
are sent directly by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newvoter</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">com</ENAMEX>-allowing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Greenpeace</ENAMEX> to mail her too.

            
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newvoter</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX> hasn't brought its service to the market yet, or even settled on
its exact business plan-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Strama</ENAMEX> says a "big announcement" is coming soon-but the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> plans to sell its service to grass-roots political <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> across the political spectrum.

            
Strama, who was Rock the Vote's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of programs, thinks <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newvoter</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX> is
more likely to boost <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voter</ENAMEX> turnout than either traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voter</ENAMEX> drives or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">motor</ENAMEX>-voter registration. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> who register to vote when they are engaged by
a political Web site are more likely to turn out than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX> who register while
waiting in line at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMV</ENAMEX>. And <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are more likely to vote if they are
reminded close to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Election Day</TIMEX> about the issue that made them register in the
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> place. It's not going to revolutionize politics, but it may send a few
more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to the polls to cast a ballot for a cause they care about.
