Wrap-Up
            

            It is difficult to give
a precise definition of electricity (particularly if you spent much of
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">seventh</NUMEX>-grade science class mooning over your <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lab partner</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sally Gilbert</ENAMEX>), but
it seems to have something to do with the movement of electrons from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> part
of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Long Island</ENAMEX> to another. Electricity enters our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cinderblock</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">warehouses</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">copper</ENAMEX> wires, much as does <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HBO</ENAMEX>, but electricity
generally keeps its blouse on even after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">11 o'clock at night</TIMEX> (as did <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sally</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gilbert</ENAMEX>, at least to my adolescent knowledge). Apparently electricity has
something to do with lightning, as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Benjamin Franklin</ENAMEX> demonstrated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1752</TIMEX> in a
famous experiment that no doubt proved something or other. This didn't make him
any less popular in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> where he was catnip to the ladies. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1768</TIMEX>, Luigi
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Galvani</ENAMEX> ran electric current through the legs of a freshly killed frog making
them twitch and no doubt contributing to the bad feelings most <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">frogs</ENAMEX> have about
their place in the sciences. Not that they were so happy about their place in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX>. And so perhaps the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> things we can say with confidence about
electricity are that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) it's tough to be a frog  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) unless you've been kissed
by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sally Gilbert</ENAMEX>.

            Somebody was growing hydroponic pot.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Police</ENAMEX> charged <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Francisco</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dandraia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Salinas</ENAMEX> with criminal possession of marijuana and stealing
electricity. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> is accused of tapping into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Long Island Power Authority</ENAMEX>
electric lines for the current to run <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,000-watt</NUMEX> high-intensity halide lamps
and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon dioxide</ENAMEX> generators to stimulate the growth of pot <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> in
high-tech hydroponic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">tanks</ENAMEX>. This system produces mature <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">four to six</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX> instead of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several months</TIMEX> required under ordinary growing conditions.
The excellent "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">connoisseur</ENAMEX>'s cannabis" sold for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$5,000</NUMEX> a pound. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> spliced
into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LIPA</ENAMEX> power lines not to avoid paying for electricity but to avoid the
huge electric bills, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $50,000</NUMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13 months</TIMEX>, that would have called
attention to their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX>. But heat dispersal was their undoing.
