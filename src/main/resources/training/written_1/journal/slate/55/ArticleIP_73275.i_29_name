Wrap-Up
            

            To
many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Case</ENAMEX> is the apotheosis of modernity, reason enough to
note that the salient feature of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AOL Time Warner</ENAMEX>-aside from its ability to
crush all before it like a mighty juggernaut-is its massive blandness. It's the
family <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX> of media <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">conglomerates</ENAMEX>. A clue to the popularity of such
dullness can be found in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sports Illustrated</ENAMEX> swimsuit issue, the
innovative merging of journalism and soft-core porn that put that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> in
the black and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of frat <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> into a swoon. Why, in an era of readily
available pornography, does AOL thrive by blocking it and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SI</ENAMEX> by selling
it in so watered-down a form? Because it is undemanding. Passionate involvement
with sex, politics, or dinner can be exhausting. Each intense encounter demands
alertness, ingenuity, and a willingness to overturn old assumptions. Each
challenges. On the other hand, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McDonald's</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SI</ENAMEX> swimsuits
are essentially reassuring. Their appeal is their familiarity. They comfort the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participant</ENAMEX>, reinforcing his preconceptions. That's the moneymaking way to
appeal to the timid, the plump, and the contented-i.e., to those who enjoy the
status quo. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McDonald's</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SI swimsuits</ENAMEX>: Each lulls. Like
a warm glass of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cheese</ENAMEX>.

Catastrophe Answer
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nelson Mandela</ENAMEX> upbraided the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Burundi</ENAMEX>'s
warring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">factions</ENAMEX> for bringing death and misery to their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>, shaming it
before the world.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mandela</ENAMEX> denounced their failure to stop the civil
war that has killed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200,000</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>. He
was especially critical of their not having included the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> of all armed
rebel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> in their negotiations.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Burundi</ENAMEX>'s conflict is a
frightening echo of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hutu</ENAMEX>'s slaughter of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 500,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Tutsi</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rwanda</ENAMEX>,
its northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX>. Recently the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Burundi</ENAMEX> ordered <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">350,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hutu</ENAMEX>
to leave their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> and move to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> camps to deter them from aiding guerrilla
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fighters</ENAMEX>.
