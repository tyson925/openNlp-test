Wrap-Up
            

             

            If you ran a Nexis
search or, like me, made up some data, you'd find that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> nongovernmental
organizations most assiduously covered by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> are the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vatican</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard</ENAMEX>. But while the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> swoons before these cradles of
power, the general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX>-by which I mean my deadbeat <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>-disdains them
both, and it's not entirely jealousy. For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> thing, within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five minutes</TIMEX> of
meeting one of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> they inevitably let you know: I attended the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">College</ENAMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cardinals</ENAMEX>. Or the constant name-dropping: my old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">roommate</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Stinky</ENAMEX>, is the
papal nuncio. Or the vanity disguised as humility: Does this vestment make me
look fat? Or the way, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30 years later</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40 years later</TIMEX>, some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> is still talking
about where he was an altar <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX>. We hate that sort of thing around the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Penn</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Club</ENAMEX>. Puts us right off our scrapple.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Liposuction</ENAMEX>.

            And eye jobs, tummy
tucks, tooth whitening, wrinkle removal, and other cosmetic procedures. These
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vanity</ENAMEX> treatments, once scorned around the med <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>, are now enjoying
increased respect because there's money in them. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Doctors</ENAMEX> weary of the
income-limiting effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HMOs</ENAMEX> find it more lucrative to deliver unnecessary
medicine to rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX> who pay for it themselves. "Now, in terms of survival,
it is what you do," said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kling</ENAMEX>, who has a dermatology and cosmetic surgery
practice on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Park Avenue</ENAMEX>. "And of course by 'survival' I mean able to afford a
solid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX> hat like the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> on my pet <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkey</ENAMEX>, over there in the Jacuzzi filled
with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">champagne</ENAMEX>," he did not add.
