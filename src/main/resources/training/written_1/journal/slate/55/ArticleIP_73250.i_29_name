            Whenever I read that a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> is "lush and creamy,"
"elegant," "lovely," "graceful," "generous," "luscious," or "smooth," I gag.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">These days</TIMEX>, I gag a lot.

            I've had cheesecake that's lush and creamy. Tequila
and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">whiskey</ENAMEX> divide into smooth and rough. My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> is elegant, lovely, graceful,
and even luscious. But contrary to what you read on the back of some bottles,
these terms are meaningless when applied to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">label</ENAMEX> on Castlewood
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Grove</ENAMEX>'s chardonnay claims that its wine has a "superb nose." <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White Oak</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">chardonnay</ENAMEX> boasts a "mouth-filling richness," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McDowell</ENAMEX>'s syrah is
"ripe-flavored and appealing for immediate enjoyment," <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Turnbull</ENAMEX>'s cabernet
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sauvignon</ENAMEX> has "legendary concentration and elegance," and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Truchard's</ENAMEX> version of
the same grape has "great <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> and distinction." Others describe tannins
as "polished," <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">grapes</ENAMEX> as "rubenesque," and fruit flavors as "forward,"
"abundant," and "bright."

            Most wine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> similarly enjoy gyring and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gimbling</ENAMEX> in the wabe. Take this sentence about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Napa Wine & Co.</ENAMEX>'s sauvignon
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">blanc</ENAMEX>, excerpted from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Connoisseur</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guide</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">California Wine</ENAMEX> and printed
on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of those little cards that wine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">merchants</ENAMEX> put in front of bottles. "From
the first sniff, one is impressed by the precise, deep but never bombastic
aromas in which green <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">apple</ENAMEX> and crenshaw melon scents [ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sic</ENAMEX> ] and by a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">creamy</ENAMEX>, vanillin accent of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">oak</ENAMEX>, and it is wonderfully balanced on the palate
with ripe richness set off by firming <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> and brightness."

            Why do these people
write this way? Is this what happens when your job requires you to drink before
noon?

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ann Noble</ENAMEX>, a sensory <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientist</ENAMEX>-flavor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chemist</ENAMEX> in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">viticulture</ENAMEX> and enology <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of California</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Davis</ENAMEX>,
would ban from the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX>-tasting lexicon whole pages of words that she deems
imprecise, vague, or hedonic (her word).

            "What the hell is 'stylish'<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">?</ENAMEX>" <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noble</ENAMEX> asks me. "Is a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Volkswagen</ENAMEX> stylish? Is a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Humvee stylish?</ENAMEX>" She hates "harmonious," disdains
"fragrant," and despises "dense," which she says "doesn't mean exactly
anything." Winemakers, she says, favor fuzzy terms for a reason. "The labels
are for marketing an image," she says.

            Having researched how <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> assess <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noble</ENAMEX> now
teaches scientific techniques to describe it precisely. To this end, she has
developed a lovely, impressive, and wonderfully balanced tool, which she calls
the wine aroma
wheel. The words found on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noble</ENAMEX>'s wine aroma wheel do not make me sick to
my stomach.

            Noble divides her wheel
into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> rings. The inner <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ring</ENAMEX> has the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> "specific and analytical words"
that she believes best describe wine aromas: fruity, vegetative, nutty,
caramelized, woody, earthy, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemical</ENAMEX>, pungent, oxidized, microbiological,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">floral</ENAMEX>, and spicy. The middle ring subdivides these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> words into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX> more
specific categories, and the outer ring offers <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">94</NUMEX> still more precise
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">descriptions</ENAMEX>. A sophisticated nose might thus distinguish a fruity <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> as
smelling like <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">citrus</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">berry</ENAMEX>, tree <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX>, tropical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX>, or dried fruit. The
outer ring ups the olfactory ante again, dividing these terms into such exact
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">descriptions</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">strawberry jam vs. strawberry</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noble</ENAMEX>'s main aim is not to teach wine appreciation. Rather,
she strives for a standard terminology that cuts through the babble of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">winespeak</ENAMEX>. Her undergraduate course "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Sensory Evaluation of Wines</ENAMEX>" is the first
step in this process, teaching <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> how to link aromas to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX>. It's a
"kindergarten of the nose," she says.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noble</ENAMEX>'s Web page contains the
nose-training workout that she uses in "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Sensory Evaluation of Wines": First</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> pour <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> into a bunch of glasses and then drop a different "physical
standard" into each <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>. For white <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wines</ENAMEX>, the physical standards include clove,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bell pepper</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">brine</ENAMEX> from canned <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">asparagus</ENAMEX>, and apricot puree. The point of
making these physical standards is to educate your nose to recognize these
aromas in an undoctored glass of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX>. Next, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> pour samples from a
variety of white <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wines</ENAMEX>.

            "From this point on, anything goes: Smell the wines
first, smell the standards, start to see which terms describe which <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX>,"
writes <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Noble</ENAMEX>.

            When I told <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noble</ENAMEX> that I
was tackling the workout, she replied, "Your nose is going to start to talk to
you because the contrasts really stand out."

            Following <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noble</ENAMEX>'s instructions, I put a little cheap white
wine into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> glasses and then spiked each <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> with a different physical
standard: peach puree, apricot puree, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">brine</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">asparagus</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">strawberry jam</ENAMEX>, wet
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cardboard</ENAMEX>, fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">strawberry</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pineapple juice</ENAMEX>, soy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sauce</ENAMEX>, green olive, melted
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">butter</ENAMEX>, coffee grinds, fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lime juice</ENAMEX>, cloves, vanilla, and shaved almonds. I
identified the contents of each glass with a label, stretching plastic wrap
over the tops to prevent aromas from escaping. Into another set of labeled
glasses I poured <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> different chardonnays (which I expected to have
dramatically distinct attributes), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> gewürztraminer, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Riesling</ENAMEX>. After
putting <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all 20</NUMEX> of the glasses on the dining <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> table, I enrolled my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> and
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> in the kindergarten of the nose.

            As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noble</ENAMEX> instructed, we sniffed each standard,
smelled the untainted <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wines</ENAMEX>, and then went back and forth between the standards
and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wines</ENAMEX>. "My nose isn't talking to me," my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> said. Next, each of us
wrote down descriptions of each <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX>'s scent, but limited our vocabulary to
words that matched the scents wafting from the physical standards.

            Our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX>, who has great <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> and legendary
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intelligence</ENAMEX>, was a bit dense <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this evening</TIMEX> and instead of describing the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wines</ENAMEX>'
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">aromas</ENAMEX> offered blunt descriptors such as "I don't like it." <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fair</ENAMEX> enough.
Interestingly, my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> and I listed different combinations of aromas for each
of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> white <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wines</ENAMEX> under assessment. But when we spoke about the choices
we made, resniffing the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> glasses before us, we agreed on descriptions for
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wines</ENAMEX>.

            As a final exercise, we
shifted the labels identifying the white <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wines</ENAMEX> to the bottoms of the glasses,
where we couldn't read them, and then tried to guess which <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> was which. Save
for the gewürztraminer, which I thought smelled of wet cardboard and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>
had called clovelike, we failed the test-misidentifying <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wines</ENAMEX>.
Had I lost my <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine aptitude</ENAMEX> or was my nose just fatigued? <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">An hour later</TIMEX>, I
retook the test and scored <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>. I had heard my nose, loud and clear.

            Although my anecdotal evidence suggests that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noble</ENAMEX>'s method
works, I don't expect winemakers to begin printing labels that brag about a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gewürztraminer</ENAMEX>'s wet-cardboard finish. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> will continue to eschew back
labels altogether, and the more conscientious <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vintners</ENAMEX> will limit the
label lingo to useful information about the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">winery</ENAMEX>'s location, the soil in
which the grapes were grown, and the climate. And make no mistake, a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">winery</ENAMEX>
need not cram a label with absurd adjectives to sell a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX>. Recently, I bought
a bottle of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Napa's Schuetz Oles</ENAMEX> on the strength of its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">label</ENAMEX> alone: "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Planted</ENAMEX> in
the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 1960s</TIMEX>, above <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calistoga</ENAMEX> on a rattlesnake infested rocky hillside, this
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Petit Sirah</ENAMEX> produces a dangerously red <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX>," the label reads. "BE PREPARED: DO
NOT DRINK IF <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WEARING WHITE CLOTHING</ENAMEX>!"

            Now that's stylish.
