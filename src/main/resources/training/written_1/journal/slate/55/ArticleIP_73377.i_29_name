                  Dear
Prudie,
               
            

            
               I
had an experience recently that I'm not sure how to deal with. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> of my
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">daughter's</ENAMEX> was at our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>, and I gave her a ride home. During the trip she
was asking me a lot of sex questions ... such as, "Do you think it's OK to have
sex with an older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>?" and "Is it normal to 'play with yourself'<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">?</ENAMEX>" The looks
she was giving me suggested she was talking about me--and her. She is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 15</NUMEX>,
but the body is quite mature. When we got to her <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>, she hugged me and gave
me a kiss (tongue and all). Now I can't get her out of my mind! I'm sure she
wants to have sex with me.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dear C.</ENAMEX>,

            A few
words come to my mind ... Lolita ... and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">jail</ENAMEX>. If this happened as you
say, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX> is big trouble and wildly precocious. Or maybe she saw <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
Beauty too many times. To protect yourself, in all ways, do not allow any
situation to occur where you are alone with that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX>. As for "getting her out
of your mind," do understand that your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX>'s "plans" for you make
you the next thing to a science experiment. You would be a notch on her belt
and perhaps a candidate for her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> to make your life a living hell.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudie</ENAMEX> suggests you not feel flattered by this proposition and get a grip.
Quick.

                  Dear
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudence</ENAMEX>,
               
            

            
               I
feel a little odd asking for help with this, but you seem to have the savvy to
get me through this awkward situation. It stands thus: I am engaged to be
married <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</TIMEX> to a wonderful young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>. We're both thrilled, our parents
are happy, and our mutual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> haven't quit telling us that they "told us
so!" This seems like all is well. The problem, though, is bridesmaids. I want
to have a fairly simple wedding, but there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> I can't imagine
getting married without (not counting the groom). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of them is my oldest
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">friend</ENAMEX>, who is now going to college several <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> away. I have always promised
her she would be in my wedding. The other one is my closest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> in college,
who has been there with me through the last <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four tough years</TIMEX>. They're both
excited about it ... the thing is I don't know how I can pick one or the other
as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">maid</ENAMEX> of honor. Is there any way I can split the title? What can I
do?

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dear Cross</ENAMEX>,

            You
can do what some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporations</ENAMEX> do. They have co-presidents and you can have
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-maids of honor. The distinction between a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">maid</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">matron</ENAMEX> of honor and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bridesmaids</ENAMEX> is usually a different bouquet and walking down the aisle <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>.
Simply have their bouquets be identical and perhaps have them walk together.
And in conversation, refer to them as co-maids of honor. Now, wasn't that
simple? And <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudie</ENAMEX> wishes you mazel<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">-ton</NUMEX> which, of course, is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">tons</NUMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">luck</ENAMEX>.

                  Prudie,
               
            

            
               My
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">boyfriend</ENAMEX> and I plan to marry <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</TIMEX>. However, we have realized we can't
possibly receive any gifts, simply because our tiny <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX> is just barely
big enough for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of us. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anyhow</ENAMEX>, I don't know how to say "No gifts" on the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">invite</ENAMEX>, because presumably <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> would ignore it. So is it appropriate to ask
for, say, money instead? Help!

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dear Cramp</ENAMEX>,

            No,
it is not appropriate to have the invitations say "No gifts, just money,
please, due to space." <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudie</ENAMEX> will give you the secret, however, for turning
gifts into money. Take the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">goodies</ENAMEX> back for a store credit ... cash
refunds being most unusual. At some point you can select something you will
have room for. Or you can use the credit to buy a gift for someone when the
occasion demands it. Or you can sell the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX> credit, at a small discount of
course, to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> who you know is in need of purchasing whatever. And
<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">mazel-ton</NUMEX> to you, as well.

                  Dear
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudence</ENAMEX>,
               
            

            
               I
work for a small, family-owned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> of the family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> frequently
shout and swear at each other. Even though their abuse is never directed at me
(a non-family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX>), I feel uncomfortable listening to this and am ready to
start job hunting. Do you have any suggestions on how to handle the shouting?
Do I ignore them? Shout back? Thanks.
            

            

               -<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peace-Lover</ENAMEX>
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dear Peace</ENAMEX>,

            It is not a good idea to
shout at one's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employer</ENAMEX>. In the situation you describe, that privilege
apparently comes with the blood relationship. This is not an unheard-of
phenomenon, by the way, with certain volatile <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personalities</ENAMEX> who work together.
It is always a strain on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bystanders</ENAMEX>, of course, but often the underlying
relationships of the shouters can be essentially friendly. It is too bad when
the lack of control and decorum in a place of business encourages job
hunting.

            If
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudie</ENAMEX> thought it would be useful, she would recommend that you tell the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">yelling</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">duo</ENAMEX> that their form of communication is disturbing the rest of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>, but she intuits that the hotheads are in the habit and will not change.
If your job hunt is unproductive, try earplugs.
