               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">eorge W. Bush</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Gore</ENAMEX> won the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iowa</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">caucuses</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> received <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">41 percent</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> vote, followed by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Forbes</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 percent</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Keyes</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gary Bauer</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John McCain</ENAMEX>
at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Orrin Hatch</ENAMEX> won <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">barely 1 percent</NUMEX> and dropped out, endorsing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">topped Bill Bradley</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democratic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">race</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">63 percent to 35 percent</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Pundits</ENAMEX>
said the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">caucuses</ENAMEX> don't reflect the national <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">electorate</ENAMEX>, but went on to
assess their significance. The consensus spin: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> are now
bona fide
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">front-runners</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain-Bradley</ENAMEX> spin: Just
wait until <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Hampshire</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Forbes-Keyes-Bauer</ENAMEX> spin: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Together</ENAMEX>, we
out-polled <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>, which shows the power of conservative ideas.

               The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congressional Budget Office</ENAMEX> raised its estimate of the budget
surplus. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBO</ENAMEX> projects a non-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX>
surplus of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$838 billion to $1.9 trillion</NUMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next decade</TIMEX>. The new
figures-which nearly double those of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six months ago</TIMEX>-are driven by rosier
forecasts of tax revenue from the economic expansion. The optimistic spin: The
extra money will make it easier for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX> to accept <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> tax cuts,
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> to accept <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democratic</ENAMEX> spending increases, and everyone to accept
debt repayment. The pessimistic spin: No, it will just give them more territory
to fight over.

            
               An
unexpected storm blasted the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Coast</ENAMEX>. Snow closed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airports</ENAMEX>
and caused blackouts from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Carolina</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New England</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meteorologists</ENAMEX> said
they knew it was coming-just not this soon-and blamed advanced computer
models for the oversight. A recent study showed that the current <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La</ENAMEX>
Ni√±a-a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-to-<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two-year</TIMEX> pattern of severe <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winters</TIMEX> in the northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aridity</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southwest</ENAMEX>-may be part of a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX>-long oscillation in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">world</ENAMEX>'s climate. If so, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winters</TIMEX> may be colder in the northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> for
many <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>. The rosy spin: A decadeslong <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Ni√±a</ENAMEX> cycle will 
cool the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX> and alleviate global warming. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Click</ENAMEX> for an "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Assessment</ENAMEX>"

            A
study linked dual hormone therapy to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Cancer</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institute</ENAMEX> found that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>'s risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> increases by
<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8 percent</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each year</TIMEX> she takes both estrogen and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">progesterone</ENAMEX>-the
most commonly prescribed hormone replacements during and after menopause. There
is no obvious alternative because: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) taking nothing increases the risk of
<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart disease</ENAMEX> and osteoporosis; and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) taking estrogen alone increases the risk
of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">uterine cancer</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Researchers</ENAMEX> suggested that more data is needed to determine
which treatment has the lowest overall death rate. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Doctors</ENAMEX> said they did not
know what to recommend in light of the study's conclusions and advised <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> to
seek recommendations from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Ä¶ their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Miami</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Immigration and Naturalization Service</ENAMEX> ordered his <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Miami</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX> to bring him to a "neutral
location " for the meeting. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandmothers</ENAMEX> came to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>
to meet with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>
and to urge them not to support a bill granting <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Eli√°n U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizenship</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> said he had not decided whether he would sign or veto such a
measure. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Miami</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX> assert that the best way to honor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eli√°n</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother-</ENAMEX>who died bringing him to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Unites States</ENAMEX>-is to grant him <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizenship</ENAMEX>.
His <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandmothers</ENAMEX> contend that his mother's memory would be most honored by
reuniting the
family.  

            

               The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> upheld state campaign donation limits. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6-3</ENAMEX> decision declared that such restrictions 
do not violate <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">First Amendment</ENAMEX> rights, as "money is property; it is not
speech." <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Reformers</ENAMEX> said the ruling showed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX>'s openness
to an overhaul of campaign-finance laws. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Opponents</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reformers</ENAMEX>
shouldn't jump the gun, since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1</TIMEX>) the decision did not deal with "soft money";
and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> refused to overturn its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1976</TIMEX> decision that campaign
spending limits do impede free speech.

including the critically hyped <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Sopranos</ENAMEX> , won most of the
television awards. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Newspapers</ENAMEX> said the big stories were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) the continuing
ascendancy of independent films and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) the continuing decline of network
television. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Observers</ENAMEX> debated whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golden Globes</ENAMEX> were the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oscars</ENAMEX>' <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>)

               <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> is facing increasing challenges in the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Chechen war</ENAMEX>. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kremlin</ENAMEX> revealed that it had spent <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 percent</NUMEX> more than budgeted on the war and
admitted that nearly
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX> have died. More
bad news is anticipated: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Council of Europe</ENAMEX> is considering
suspension of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX>'s membership because of its attacks on civilian areas; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>)
Western <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">creditors</ENAMEX> may eliminate financial aid that is indirectly subsidizing
the war; and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) costs will increase as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> tries to maintain control over
captured areas of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chechnya</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Russia</ENAMEX> insists that it is stamping out
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">terrorists</ENAMEX> , not restarting a war. But the international consensus is
that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kremlin</ENAMEX> has not learned the lessons of its failed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> campaign.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tennessee Titans</ENAMEX> will meet in the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Super Bowl</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rams</ENAMEX> beat <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tampa Bay</ENAMEX>

<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11-6</NUMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFC</ENAMEX> title, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Titans</ENAMEX> won the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">AFC</ENAMEX> championship

<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33-14</NUMEX> over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jacksonville</ENAMEX>. Both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) "powerhouse" offenses; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>)
heroic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">quarterbacks</ENAMEX>; and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) perpetual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">underdog</ENAMEX> status. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Optimists</ENAMEX> said the
unexpected match-up injected excitement into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">league</ENAMEX>, since it showed that
any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> can make the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Super Bowl</ENAMEX>. Skeptics doubted that much
excitement would be generated by "TV markets No. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XXXII</ENAMEX> and XXXIII

               A
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> test of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX>'s missile defense system failed. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX>
said that the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$100 million</NUMEX> test went perfectly until <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the final six seconds</TIMEX>,
when an infrared sensor failed. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last October</TIMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> test was successful. After
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> more attempt, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> will determine whether the missile shield can be
deployed by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2005</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> will decide whether to proceed with the
program. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Critics</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponents</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">program</ENAMEX> urged <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> to delay
his decision until after the election. The program's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supporters</ENAMEX>--who compared
the project to trying to "hit
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bullet</ENAMEX> with a bullet "--said that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) success in the next test will
justify a go-ahead; and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) the setbacks result from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s unrealistic
timetable.

            

               The wealth of most <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> is increasing. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> found that the median family's net worth rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">17.6 percent</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1995 and 1998</TIMEX>. Other good
news : <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) More <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> own stock than ever before; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) finances improved
even for those who didn't own stocks; and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minorities</ENAMEX>' net worth increased
faster than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX>'. The bad
news : <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) The richest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> reaped most of the gains; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) the poorest
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>' wealth shrunk; and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) the average <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>'s debt jumped <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly 50</NUMEX>
percent. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Optimists</ENAMEX> said the survey revealed the breadth and robustness of the
economic expansion. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pessimists</ENAMEX> said it showed the expansion's fragility and
warned that a bear market would bring it all crashing down.
