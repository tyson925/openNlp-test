Self-educated, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poor</ENAMEX> beyond imagining, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Clare</ENAMEX> experienced a brief,
condescending vogue as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX>'s "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peasant Poet</ENAMEX>," at a time when illiteracy was
a norm for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX>'s rural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>, and poets were expected to come from higher
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">social</ENAMEX> ranks. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Keats</ENAMEX>, for example, was ridiculed for writing "<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cockney</ENAMEX> poetry.")
When he was in fashion, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> would visit his cottage and sometimes give him a
few coins. When the novelty had worn off, this immensely gifted writer
experienced isolation and hardship, and finally became insane, spending most of
his life in an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX>. The tough, memorable language of "I Am"
demonstrates that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clare</ENAMEX> was an extremely impressive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX>. Lines such as "I am
the self-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumer</ENAMEX> of my woes" have a distinction and force that need no
propping up by the pathos of the life behind the writing. The plainness of this
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">poem</ENAMEX> is wonderfully achieved and eloquent.

            
               --<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Pinsky</ENAMEX>
            

            I am: yet what I am none
cares or knows     My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> forsake me like a memory lost,I am the
self-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumer</ENAMEX> of my woes--     They rise and vanish in oblivious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX>,Like
shadows in love's frenzied, stifled throes--And yet I am, and live--like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vapors</ENAMEX>
tossed

            Into the nothingness of
scorn and noise,     Into the living sea of waking dreams,Where there is
neither sense of life or joys,     But the vast shipwreck of my life's
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">esteems</ENAMEX>;Even the dearest, that I love the best,Are strange--nay, rather
stranger than the rest.

            I long for
scenes, where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> hath never trod,     A place where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> never smiled or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">wept</ENAMEX>--There to abide with my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Creator</ENAMEX>, God,     And sleep as I in childhood
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sweetly</ENAMEX> slept,<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Untroubling</ENAMEX>, and untroubled where I lie,The grass below--above
the vaulted sky.
