            I'd bought a cone of solid
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sugar</ENAMEX> and a boxOf <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> for the saint himself, a felt-tip penFor his son, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">saint</ENAMEX>-elect, and bubblegumFor a confusion of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">small fry</ENAMEX>--the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five-year-oldAunt</TIMEX>,
say, and her <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nephew</ENAMEX>.Nothing for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, of course, the
tattooed,<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX>-eyed, moon-faced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">matron</ENAMEX>, or her daughterWhose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> had long ago
run awayAfter killing their newborn by pouringA bottle of cheap cologne down
its throat.This was, after all, our <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> meeting.

            I was to be introduced by
a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peace Corps</ENAMEX> palWhose easy, open <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> waysHad brought a water system to
the villageAnd an up-to-date word to its vocabulary.Every other guttural
spillway of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ArabicIncluded</ENAMEX> a carefully enunciated "awesome,"The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX>
bright-eyed with his own banter.We sat on a pair of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kurt Cobain</ENAMEX> beach towelsAnd
under a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">High-Quality Quartz Clock</ENAMEX>,The plastic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">butterflies</ENAMEX> attached to whose
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">handsSeemed</ENAMEX> to keep time with those in my stomach.

            At last, he entered the
room, the saint himself,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moulay Madani</ENAMEX>, in a white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> scarf and caftanThe
fading blue of a map's <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Moroccan</ENAMEX> coastline,Its hem embroidered with geometric
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ports</ENAMEX> of call.A rugged <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixty</TIMEX>, with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">longshoreman</ENAMEX>'s jaw,A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courtier</ENAMEX>'s guile, and
a statesman's earnest pauses,He <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> explained the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">crescent dagger</ENAMEX> he
fingeredHad been made <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two centuries ago</TIMEX> by a clever <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jew</ENAMEX>.Then he squinted for my
reaction. I've no tasteFor bad <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX>, and gingerly cleared my throat to sayI
was inclined to trust any saint who carried a knife.

            From a copper <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">urn</ENAMEX>, glasses
of mint <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> were poured,Of a tongue-stiffening sweetness. I was allowed to
waveAway the tray of nougat--or rather, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">flies</ENAMEX> on it.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sipping</ENAMEX>, I waited for a
word, a sign from the saint.I'd wanted to lie, as if underground, and watch Him
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dig</ENAMEX> up the sky, or stand at a riverbankAnd have the water sweep off my
presumptions,Have him blow light into my changeling bones.I wanted to feel the
stalk rise and the blade fall.I wanted my life's arithmetic glazed and fired.I
wanted the hush, the wingstroke, the shudder.

            But sainthood, I learned
soon enough, is a fateWorse than life, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">nights</TIMEX> on call for the demonsIn a
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vomiting lamb</ENAMEX>, a dry breast, a broken radio,And <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> spent parroting the
timeless adages,Spent arbitrating water rights, property lines,Or feuds between
rival herdsmen over scrub brush,Spent blessing every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bride</ENAMEX> and anyone's
big-belliedFourth or <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>, praying that they deliver <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sons</ENAMEX>.I thought back
to the time, not <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> feet from him,I heard a homily delivered by old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">John</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XXIII</ENAMEX>,Sounding wholly seraphic in his murmured <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX>.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Ten</NUMEX> interpreters stepped
from behind the throne.The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> one at last explained the Holy FatherHad
urged us all to wear seatbelts while driving.My heart sank at its plain good
sense, as hymnsEchoed and golden canopies enfolded the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pope</ENAMEX>,How like <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> it
seemed, with my own fatherA preoccupied <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patriarch</ENAMEX> of practicalityWhen what was
wanted veered wildly betweenThe gruff <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">headmaster</ENAMEX> and the drunken
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">playwright</ENAMEX>.Instead, I got the distant advertising <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">salesman</ENAMEX>,The suburban <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> of
what turned out to be my dreams ...

            Dreams that, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX>
later, back at my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fez</ENAMEX>,A bucket of cold <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> was suddenly poured
on.I'd gone to the hammam, stripped, and lay on a patternOf sopping tiles that
might have spelled God's will.Steam shrouded the attendant methodically
soapingThe knots of disappointment he'd knuckled in my back.He paused. I
drifted [ The freezing shock. ] I looked upAt a bald, toothless gnome in
swaddling clothesOn his way back to the fountain for more bad news.Something in
his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bowlegged</ENAMEX> walk--perhaps the wearyRoutine of it--made me think of the saint
again,

            Of how, when
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> was done, and everyone had stood,He reached for my head, put his hands over
it,And gently pulled me to his chest, which smelledOf dung smoke and cinnamon
and mutton grease.I could hear his wheezy breathing now, like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">prophet</ENAMEX>'s
Last whispered word repeated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">faithful</ENAMEX>.Then he prayed for what no one had
time to translate--His <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> interrupted the old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> to tell him a groupOf snake
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">charmers</ENAMEX> sought his blessing, and a blind <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">thief</ENAMEX>.The saint pushed me away, took
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> long look,Then straightened my collar and nodded me toward the door.
