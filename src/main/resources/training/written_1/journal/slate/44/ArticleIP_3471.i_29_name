            We all know something of
what went on during the reign (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1924-1953</TIMEX>) of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Stalin</ENAMEX>: show trials,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">purges</ENAMEX>, mass executions, death <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camps</ENAMEX>. We may also know something about how
history was rewritten wholesale in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">those years</TIMEX>--how the
facts concerning the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Revolution</ENAMEX> were successively recast as key figures
fell from favor, how the existence of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leon Trotsky</ENAMEX> was first reviled and then
denied after he was forced into exile in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1927</TIMEX>, how even such things as the
invention of electric light were reattributed to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russians</ENAMEX> in the textbooks (an
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">astonishing</ENAMEX> number of scientific breakthroughs were allegedly the work of one
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Popov</ENAMEX>). These matters run the gamut from the monstrous to the comical. The
scale of crimes against humanity, against truth, against common sense engaged
in by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stalin</ENAMEX> and his minions is so extraordinary that merely reading about them
can provoke numbness. The figures blur. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USSR</ENAMEX> seems an alternate
universe.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David King</ENAMEX>'s
new book, however, demonstrates all these things with clarity, concision, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">force</ENAMEX>, through the use of period pictures. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> images on its cover, for
example, dryly sum up the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tenor</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stalin</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>. In the first photograph,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stalin</ENAMEX> is shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Leningrad</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1926</TIMEX>, posed at a worktable with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> cadres;
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of them had just been made first <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX> of the local party. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>
is a version printed in a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1940</TIMEX> History of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USSR</ENAMEX> , looking less like a
photograph than like an awkward charcoal tracing; the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">comrade</ENAMEX> on the left has
been excised, having in fact been imprisoned prior to being shot. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX>
version, which appeared in a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1949</TIMEX> biography of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stalin</ENAMEX>, is more the work of an
airbrush than a camera; the figure on the far right is now gone as well,
although it is unclear why, since he remained in favor until <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stalin</ENAMEX>'s death.
The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> picture, an oil painting from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1929</TIMEX>, is actually out of sequence
chronologically, but its point is clear. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stalin</ENAMEX> appears in the same pose, at
the same table, but alone. The focus of that image turns out to have been the
focus of the other images as well: the meaty knuckle of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stalin</ENAMEX>'s left middle
finger, weighing on the table with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">tons</NUMEX>. The sequence is
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cartoonlike</ENAMEX>--by the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> image, we imagine that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> absent apparatchiks
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">reside in Stalin</ENAMEX>'s belly.

            We know that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">nowadays</ENAMEX>, photographs can be digitally manipulated with ease; in the era in
question, they were manipulated crudely and grotesquely, using scissors, ink,
and airbrushes. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">King</ENAMEX> shows us sequence after sequence of group photographs--the
original happy gathering of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Old Bolsheviks</ENAMEX>, say, and then one or more
variations printed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later years</TIMEX> from which figures have been excised after
they fell from grace. The altered pictures rarely look convincing. When I was
younger, I would occasionally come across books issued by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Progress Publishers</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moscow</ENAMEX>, and I never failed to be puzzled by the poor quality of the
photographic illustrations--even works published in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1970s</TIMEX> featured <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pasty</ENAMEX>,
smudgy, usually blue-tinted approximations of photos (the translated works, for
that matter, were printed in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">roman typeface</ENAMEX> that looked as if it had been
purchased before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1917</TIMEX> from a Western dime-novel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX>). The motive for this
technical inferiority was probably budgetary, but there is no denying that it
made falsification so much easier, since even the unaltered pictures look like
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fakes</ENAMEX>. A yawning gap in the lineup of military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX>; a face that failed to
match the body attached to it; a face whose shading did not match that of the
faces on either side; an elbow marooned in space, bereft of other body
parts--such things could just pass for evidence of ineptitude.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">King</ENAMEX>'s book
is rich in horrors: The photographs in which faces have been blotted out with
ink smears or hysterically attacked with a pen are more immediately alarming
than the ones from which figures have been surgically removed, and there are
sobering unretouched <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> shots of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NKVD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bureaucrats</ENAMEX> and the prosecution staff
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Soviet</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mass murderers</ENAMEX> who invariably look like factory hands or
math <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX>. But the overwhelming impression the book leaves is less of
devastation per se than of contempt--the contempt the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Little Father of the</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> felt for ordinary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>, the generalized contempt for human
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intelligence</ENAMEX> that pervaded his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>.

            Nowhere is this contempt more
evident than in the images that purport to represent friendship, fellowship,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">joy</ENAMEX>, triumph, and even grief, all of them exclusively formal modes. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stalin</ENAMEX>'s
face juxtaposed with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lenin</ENAMEX>'s bier in a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1939</TIMEX> photomontage can be imagined as
mourning only by an effort of will; he is sidelit, vampiric, sinister--but then
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stalin</ENAMEX> rarely fails to look sinister in photographs, and this is not merely a
matter of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewer</ENAMEX>'s preconceptions. In paintings and drawings <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stalin</ENAMEX> is
often represented in utterly fictitious settings: addressing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> on the
factory <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX>, say, or surrounded by gleeful ethnic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">types</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Soviet</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">republics</ENAMEX>. His eyes are narrowed, his mustache conceals his mouth but is
bracketed by laugh lines--he is made to denote some kind of perfunctory
emotion, actual emotion being consigned to his grinning <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>. And he is
often shown entwined in fishing-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buddy</ENAMEX> affection with the departed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lenin</ENAMEX>, whose
will actually called for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stalin</ENAMEX>'s removal as general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX>, though it was
suppressed. In almost every representation, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stalin</ENAMEX> appears either more or less
than human, a mobile icon wheeled about, as real as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">stuffed trout</ENAMEX>.

            Posed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of commissars,
meanwhile, display collective warmth in the way that department-store
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mannequins</ENAMEX> do when they are grouped on the same pedestal. Of course, the
picture in your local newspaper of the fund-drive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> handing an oversized
check to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mayor</ENAMEX> features smiles that are scarcely more genuine. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">King</ENAMEX>'s book
is of enormous historical value, but it should not encourage smugness. We are
currently capable of perpetrating every kind of visual lie on display here, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">seamlessly</ENAMEX> and invisibly at that, for reasons some may well think are
justified. Everyone has a little <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stalin</ENAMEX> lurking somewhere within.
