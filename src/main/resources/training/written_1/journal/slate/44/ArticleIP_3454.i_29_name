               (Note: "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Life and Art</ENAMEX>"
is an occasional column that compares fiction, in various <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX>, with the
real-life facts it is ostensibly based on.)
            

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Wallace</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNT</ENAMEX>'s
biopic about the former <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alabama</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-time presidential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX>,
begins and ends with disclaimers. The opening statement says that characters
and dialogue have been created or altered for "dramatic purposes." The closing
statement says that one of the central <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Archie</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wallace</ENAMEX>'s black
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">servant</ENAMEX>, "was created to reflect a viewpoint concerning this turbulent period
of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> history."

            Besides
these acknowledged fabrications, how far has <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Frankenheimer</ENAMEX>'s TV
movie <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">strayed</ENAMEX> from the truth? <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Factually</ENAMEX>, it seems, not all that much--at least
not by the standards of docudrama, where synthesized <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> and invented
dialogue are routine. But in its selection of material to include and
exclude--and in its interpretation-- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Wallace</ENAMEX> operates with a
pretty free hand.

            The film portrays the fervent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponent</ENAMEX> of the civil rights
movement as a thoroughgoing bigot. As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frankenheimer</ENAMEX> told the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>
Times , "What we're doing is the story of a racist." To some, such as
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephan Lesher</ENAMEX>, who wrote the authorized biography <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Wallace</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Populist</ENAMEX> , that interpretation is crude. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lesher</ENAMEX> says in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Weekly</ENAMEX>
Standard that "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewers</ENAMEX> without prior knowledge likely will leave the film
believing that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wallace</ENAMEX> began and ended with racism"--and fail to learn about
how "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wallace</ENAMEX> helped set the political agenda that dominates <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>." The film also does little to suggest what other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">historians</ENAMEX>
believe: that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wallace</ENAMEX> was a canny <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opportunist</ENAMEX> who embraced racist rhetoric when
it was politically advantageous and jettisoned it when it wasn't.

            To recount
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wallace</ENAMEX>'s famous civil rights battles, the film uses facts that are more or
less accurate (though it includes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> major fictionalizations along the way).
We see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wallace</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gary Sinise</ENAMEX>) lose his <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> bid for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1958</TIMEX> to an
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponent</ENAMEX> who capitalized on segregationist themes and racist rhetoric. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Wallace</ENAMEX>
then declares to his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aides</ENAMEX>, "I'm not going to be out-niggered" again. Did he
really say this? <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wallace</ENAMEX> denies it. But his first <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biographer</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marshall Frady</ENAMEX>,
who co-wrote the teleplay, reported the remark in his book <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wallace</ENAMEX> ; and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Emory</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan Carter</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Politics of Rage</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">George</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wallace</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Origins of the New Conservatism, and the Transformation of</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Politics</ENAMEX> , had it confirmed by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> who was present. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Wallace</ENAMEX>
ran a harsher campaign in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1962</TIMEX>--he did not, for instance, denounce the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Klan</ENAMEX>, as
he had in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1958</TIMEX>--and won. We don't see the campaign, but we do hear parts of his
famous <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1963</TIMEX> inaugural speech. Sinise, speaking from the actual transcript,
promises, "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Segregation</ENAMEX> now, segregation <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX>, segregation forever." The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">film</ENAMEX> also faithfully re-creates <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wallace</ENAMEX>'s attempt to prevent <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>
from registering at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Alabama</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tuscaloosa</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wallace</ENAMEX> is seen
standing in a school doorway on a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 1963</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX>, and then stepping aside,
eventually, under federal pressure.

            
Employing historical footage, the film also
shows state troopers attacking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voter-registration marchers</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Selma</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 7</TIMEX>,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1965</TIMEX>, with tear <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clubs</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sinise's Wallace</ENAMEX> tells his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aides</ENAMEX> that the
troopers were justifiably trying to keep the peace and protect the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> from
"agitators." While accounts conflict about whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wallace</ENAMEX> authorized the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">troopers</ENAMEX>' use of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX>, the film's portrayal of his reaction is consistent with
the record. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carter</ENAMEX> writes, "[<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wallace</ENAMEX>] never issued a single word of public
criticism. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">A quarter-century later</TIMEX>--while expressing regret for the injuries
suffered by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">marchers</ENAMEX>--he insisted that troopers had 'saved their lives by
stopping that march.' "

            The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">film</ENAMEX>'s conclusion is also based on a real event. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1974</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gov.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wallace</ENAMEX>,
crippled by a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1972</TIMEX> assassination attempt, enters <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montgomery</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Dexter Street</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baptist Church</ENAMEX>, where the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rev.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin Luther King Jr.</ENAMEX> had preached. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Wallace</ENAMEX>
asks the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">congregation</ENAMEX> for forgiveness. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX> starts <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">to sing "Amazing</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grace</ENAMEX>." The visit did happen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carter</ENAMEX> notes, however, that it wasn't
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">spontaneous</ENAMEX>, as it is in the film; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wallace</ENAMEX> had been invited to speak. Also,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carter</ENAMEX> says that news accounts "give no hint that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wallace</ENAMEX> explicitly asked for
forgiveness"; he just said he opposed integration because he favored <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>'
rights, not racism.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> inventions are used to bolster the dramatic power of
this conclusion: In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>, which takes place just after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Selma</ENAMEX> march scene,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Archie</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarence Williams III</ENAMEX>), the fictional prison <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trusty</ENAMEX> who serves as
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wallace</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">servant</ENAMEX> throughout the film, stands behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX>, an ice pick
in his hand, debating whether to stab him. Oblivious to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Archie</ENAMEX>'s rage, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wallace</ENAMEX>
prattles on about a favorite black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">handyman</ENAMEX> of his youth. He clearly has far to
go before he sees the error of his ways.

            In
another, set just before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> visit, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wallace</ENAMEX> goes to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">home</ENAMEX> of his
former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populist mentor</ENAMEX>, ex-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alabama</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James E.</ENAMEX> "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Big Jim</ENAMEX>" <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Folsom</ENAMEX>. The film
correctly implies that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wallace</ENAMEX> had split with the more liberal <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Folsom</ENAMEX> over
racial politics. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wallace</ENAMEX> never paid a visit to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Folsom</ENAMEX> to say "I ain't the
same now," only to have the door slammed in his face by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Folsom</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>--a scene
from the film the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wallace</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> threatened to over.

            
Just as important, the climactic forgiveness
scene at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> is wrenched from its political context. The film doesn't
show that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wallace</ENAMEX> later apologized for his segregationist views on TV,
suggesting that his conversion had political motives. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Commentators</ENAMEX> have noted
the growth of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alabama</ENAMEX>'s black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">electorate</ENAMEX>, which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wallace</ENAMEX> now had to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX>. In
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1982</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wallace</ENAMEX> won his last race for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX> with a quarter of the black votes
cast in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democratic</ENAMEX> primary, a fact alluded to in a written epilogue at the
end of the film. Nor do we see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wallace</ENAMEX>'s cynical attempts to win black votes,
such as when he made sure a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">photographer</ENAMEX> was present at his meeting with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosa</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Parks</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the '70s</TIMEX>--something the civil rights <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activist</ENAMEX> "always resented,"
according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carter</ENAMEX>.

            Most strikingly, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wallace</ENAMEX>'s
presidential campaigns--he ran in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1964, 1968, 1972</TIMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1976</TIMEX>--are almost
entirely omitted. At a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1972</TIMEX> rally in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Laurel</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Md.</ENAMEX>, he was shot by a deranged man
and paralyzed from the waist down--one campaign scene we see in detail. But
there are almost no scenes of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wallace</ENAMEX> calling for law and order, or railing
against excessive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> and "pointy-head <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intellectuals</ENAMEX>." We don't see him
surprise the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1964</TIMEX> with strong showings in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maryland</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wisconsin</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democratic</ENAMEX> primaries--<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Deep South</ENAMEX> where he wasn't expected to
fare well. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lesher</ENAMEX> is right that we don't see the side of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wallace</ENAMEX> that has had a
continuing influence on politics <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>. As <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">historian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Brinkley</ENAMEX> wrote in a
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX> review of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lesher</ENAMEX>'s book: "In his national campaigns, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gov.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wallace</ENAMEX> laid out
in flamboyant and often witty form much of what would soon become the program
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Right</ENAMEX>." <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Wallace commits Wallace</ENAMEX>'s rhetoric and ideas
to the past, making him the last of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politician</ENAMEX>--the die-hard
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">segregationist</ENAMEX>--rather than, perhaps, the precursor of another.
