            As the turn of a millennial
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">century</ENAMEX> approaches, many works of art in various <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> will respond to that
rotation of the calendar. It will be hard for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poet</ENAMEX> to surpass the poise and
penetration of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Hardy</ENAMEX>'s "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Darkling Thrush</ENAMEX>," which is dated as being
composed on <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the last evening</TIMEX> of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19 th century</TIMEX>.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">delightfully vivid bird</ENAMEX>,
with its blend of comedy and pathos, may be <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hardy</ENAMEX>'s bow of his head toward such
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Romantic birds</ENAMEX> as the nightingale heard by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Keats</ENAMEX> in his great "Ode to a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nightingale</ENAMEX>" much earlier in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the century</TIMEX>.

            Words and
phrases like the repeated "seems," "I could think," and "I was unaware" enact
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hardy</ENAMEX>'s somewhat skeptical holding back from a declaration that the natural
surroundings reflect his mood or the human calendar. The way the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of
the poem ends with the word "I" also makes me feel a recognition that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fervorless</ENAMEX> or haunted or corpselike quality of the landscape--like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bird</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">putative</ENAMEX> "hope" <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later</TIMEX>--is something that the subjective <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observer</ENAMEX> at least half
creates.

            
               --<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Pinsky</ENAMEX>
            

            I leant upon a coppice
gate     When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frost</ENAMEX> was spectre-gray,And <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Winter</ENAMEX>'s dregs made desolate     The
weakening eye of day.The tangled bine-stems scored the sky     Like strings of
broken <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lyres</ENAMEX>,     And all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mankind</ENAMEX> that haunted nighHad sought their household
fires.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">land</ENAMEX>'s sharp features
seemed to be     The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Century</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">corpse outleant</ENAMEX>,His crypt the cloudy canopy,    
The wind his death-lament.The ancient pulse of germ and birth     Was shrunken
hard and dry,And every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spirit</ENAMEX> upon earth     Seemed fervorless as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">I.</ENAMEX>

            At once a voice arose
among     The bleak twigs overheadIn a full-hearted evensong     Of joy
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">illimited</ENAMEX>;An aged <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thrush</TIMEX>, frail, gaunt, and small     In blast-beruffled
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">plume</ENAMEX>,Had chosen thus to fling his soul     Upon the growing gloom.

            So little cause for
carolings     Of such ecstatic soundWas written on terrestrial things     Afar
or nigh around,That I could think there trembled through     His happy
good-night airSome blessed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hope</ENAMEX>, whereof he knew     And I was unaware.
