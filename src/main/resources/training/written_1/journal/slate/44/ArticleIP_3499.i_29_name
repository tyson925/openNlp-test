            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1983</TIMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> called the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coalition for the Homeless</ENAMEX> began handing out <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sandwiches</ENAMEX> and fruit <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">every night</TIMEX>
to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horde</ENAMEX> of homeless <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who gathered around <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Grand Central Station</ENAMEX>. It
was a pretty dismaying experience, straight out of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Les Mis√©rables</ENAMEX> : the
tattered <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX>, the forest of groping hands, the healthy-looking young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> who
conned their way to <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">seconds</TIMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thirds</NUMEX> while the quiet or confused went home
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">empty-handed</ENAMEX>. But at least the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">coalition</ENAMEX> was doing something . It was the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coalition</ENAMEX>, too, that had won a court order mandating a "right to shelter," a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> victory in those <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Darwinian</ENAMEX>, early <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>. Throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the '80s</TIMEX> the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coalition</ENAMEX>--and its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Hayes</ENAMEX>, a former corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX>--was the
principal voice for the homeless, both in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> and nationally. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Hayes</ENAMEX>
insisted the problem of the homeless could be summed up in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> words:
"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Housing</ENAMEX>, housing, housing."

            The
coalition succeeded by turning homelessness into a simple, powerful moral
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">equation</ENAMEX>, but the equation wasn't actually so simple. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX>, a commission
chaired by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrew Cuomo</ENAMEX>, now the federal housing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX>, released a study
showing that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">up to 30 percent</NUMEX> of single homeless <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> suffered from severe
mental <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">65 percent</NUMEX> used <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX>. The numbers for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>
were smaller but still substantial. Homeless <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocates</ENAMEX> had always known
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substance</ENAMEX> abuse was a problem, but they had rarely aired their knowledge in
public for fear that it would shift public debate and blur the image of the
homeless as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> of an unjust housing policy. They attacked the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cuomo</ENAMEX> study,
though they couldn't discredit its findings. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hayes</ENAMEX>, who had returned to
private legal practice and had begun to question his old single-minded
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">formulation</ENAMEX>, proposed to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mayor</ENAMEX>-elect <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rudy Giuliani</ENAMEX> that the court order be
revised so that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> would guarantee the homeless the "continuum of care"
that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cuomo</ENAMEX> had proposed, and the homeless in turn would be obliged to accept
counseling, work training, and the like. Despite <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giuliani</ENAMEX>'s interest the idea
went nowhere since, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hayes</ENAMEX> says, it "created a grave sense of panic, at least in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">coalition</ENAMEX>, because it was seen as undermining the ultimate entitlement to
shelter." The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">coalition</ENAMEX> seemed to be painting itself into an ideological
corner.

            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">This past March</TIMEX>, that corner became smaller still. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McDonald</ENAMEX>, another longtime <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homeless activist</ENAMEX>, filed suit against the coalition
on the grounds that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> had engaged in "harassment
and physical interference" of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rival</ENAMEX> program, called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ready</ENAMEX>, Willing &
Able. The allegation would have seemed bizarre if it hadn't been familiar: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years earlier</TIMEX>, coalition <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> had accused another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">nonprofit</ENAMEX> of using "goon
squads" of homeless <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> to roust other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homeless people</ENAMEX> from ATM
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vestibules</ENAMEX>--charges later found to be groundless.

            Ready,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Willing & Able</ENAMEX>, which runs private homeless <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shelters</ENAMEX>, requires <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>
to submit to frequent drug tests, abide by a range of rules inside the shelter,
and make modest payments toward their own <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX>. In exchange, they get
jobs renovating <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartments</ENAMEX> or cleaning <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$5.50</NUMEX> an hour, plus, when
they "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">graduate</ENAMEX>," a bonus that normally amounts to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1,000</NUMEX> to help them find
permanent housing. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McDonald</ENAMEX> is a former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sportswear executive</ENAMEX> with a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">businessman</ENAMEX>'s regard for the therapeutic power of the marketplace. The premise
of his program was that since society will never pay for the kind of long-term
drug treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cuomo</ENAMEX> and others have envisioned, and since such treatment so
often fails, the most effective form of treatment is, as he puts it, "the
positive reinforcement of a culture that's established around work, around
earning money." <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McDonald</ENAMEX> says that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two-thirds</NUMEX> of single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> on the
street can benefit from his program. This sounds pretty optimistic, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry</ENAMEX>
Rhodes, a formerly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homeless man</ENAMEX> who does "intake" at the shelter <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McDonald</ENAMEX> runs
in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Harlem</ENAMEX>, says the program has succeeded partly because it screens out drug
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">addicts</ENAMEX> and hard cases. In other words, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McDonald</ENAMEX> may not have so much solved
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cuomo</ENAMEX> problem as avoided it.

            
Still, Ready, Willing & Able provides not
only work but what appears to be a relatively calm and secure environment, and
it would hardly be surprising if this drastic change from the world of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">streets</ENAMEX>, or even of the typical shelter, motivated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> to turn around their
lives. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McDonald</ENAMEX> says <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two-thirds</NUMEX> of those who graduate from his program hold
down permanent jobs and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartments</ENAMEX>--an almost unheard-of success rate among
single homeless <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>. Most of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> I interviewed at the shelter
spoke of their experience in overtly moralistic terms: They talked about taking
responsibility for themselves, for the money they earned, and even for the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> whom they had fathered and then neglected. The program, with its
combination of rules and incentives, had prodded them to do something they
would not have done for themselves.

            
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McDonald's</ENAMEX> problems began when he tried to impose his program on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> in the
Harlem shelter who were accustomed to getting their <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">three</NUMEX> squares with no
questions asked. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McDonald</ENAMEX> acquired control of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Harlem</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX>, widely
considered one of the most dangerous and disorganized in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, when the
city turned over the shelter system to nonprofit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX>. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McDonald</ENAMEX> took
over, many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> rebelled against the program's strictures, especially the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">random</ENAMEX> drug testing. Some left for <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shelters</ENAMEX> elsewhere. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">coalition</ENAMEX> serves as
the court-appointed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">monitor</ENAMEX> for the shelter system, and what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McDonald</ENAMEX> alleges,
and others at the shelter corroborate, is that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> who represented the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coalition</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shelter</ENAMEX> worked actively with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dissidents</ENAMEX> who remained to
disrupt the program. In a meeting of all the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tenants</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late January</TIMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coalition</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">monitor</ENAMEX> allegedly called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McDonald</ENAMEX> a "<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Nazi</ENAMEX>" who was enriching
himself by exploiting poor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX>, and berated the black <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shelter</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> as
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McDonald's</ENAMEX> lackey. Coalition <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Brosnahan</ENAMEX> supposedly stood nearby
and said nothing. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dissidents</ENAMEX>, lead by the former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">coalition</ENAMEX>'s
"<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client</ENAMEX> advisory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX>," urged the other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homeless men</ENAMEX> to stop working and
allegedly issued threats of physical violence.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McDonald</ENAMEX> claims the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">coalition</ENAMEX> is "ideologically opposed" to
his program. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brosnahan</ENAMEX> has lent some credence to this charge by describing
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McDonald's</ENAMEX> work program as "indentured servitude." She declined to talk about
this case, but her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven Banks</ENAMEX>, says the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defendants</ENAMEX> deny making the
statements <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McDonald</ENAMEX> attributes to them. It is true, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Banks</ENAMEX> says, that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coalition</ENAMEX> was so disturbed about the program that it contemplated suing him.
The reason, he says, is the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$65</NUMEX> a week <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McDonald</ENAMEX> was withholding for <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX>, in violation of rules that govern the shelter system. But since
residents were free to go to a conventional <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shelter</ENAMEX>, it's hard to see what
right was violated. And since the money was being deducted from salaries they
otherwise wouldn't have had, it seems perverse to focus on the issue of rights
in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> place.

            The
fundamental issue is whether it's permissible to impose obligations on the
homeless in exchange for various goods, to regard them as something other than
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> to whom certain rights attach. This is, of course, the same question we
are now asking about welfare <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX>. We have moved very swiftly from seeing
welfare as an unconditional right to viewing it as no right at all. Perhaps we
could have found our way to a middle point if welfare's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">champions</ENAMEX> had seen
their way beyond the language of rights to a different, and more reciprocal,
kind of social contract. The sad story of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coalition for the Homeless</ENAMEX>, and
of its decline from the moral pinnacle it once occupied, is a parable of that
failure of vision.
