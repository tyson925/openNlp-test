            What's wrong with country
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">music today?</ENAMEX> "Once upon a time, wild-eyed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX>, high on home brew and diet
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pills</ENAMEX>, ran amok and plowed the occasional luxury <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">sedan</ENAMEX> into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> just
off [<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nashville</ENAMEX>'s] <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Music Row</ENAMEX>. ... The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> had big hair, bigger times,
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">truckstop/</ENAMEX>trailer <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> chic, and no problem singing songs about the real sexual
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">politic</ENAMEX>." This bit of historical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camp</ENAMEX> comes from a recent issue of No
<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Depression</ENAMEX> , an infectiously enthusiastic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Seattle</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> that calls
itself "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Alternative Country</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Whatever That Is) Quarterly</ENAMEX>." Most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about</NUMEX> country music are either oriented toward <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">collectors</ENAMEX>, like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal</ENAMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Country Music</ENAMEX> , or oriented toward <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX>, like any number of
Nashville <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publications</ENAMEX> about commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. But this is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> for a
new market: young music <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fans</ENAMEX> who grasp the absurdism in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dolly Parton</ENAMEX>'s act, who
understand that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merle Haggard</ENAMEX> is a better <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">singer</ENAMEX> than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Garth Brooks</ENAMEX>, who see
punk-influenced bands like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Waco Brothers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilco</ENAMEX> as a vindication of
their idea of country music.

            
Alternative <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> is a reaction against the antiseptic safety of mainstream
country music. It's retro by necessity, so as to avoid the anemic white-soul
pablum that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> became in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1980s</TIMEX>. It is deprogrammed, studiously sloppy,
bad-tempered, unfit for commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> radio, heavy with the down-market
embarrassment of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>'s hillbilly past, and mostly made by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rockers</ENAMEX>. Its
lyrics often caricature old-style <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> songs; they sound a lot like bad
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Faulkner</ENAMEX> ("<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June</TIMEX> went insane by the time she was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX>/ killed her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> with a
tire iron," sings <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> alternative <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> act, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moonshine Willy</ENAMEX>). Its
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">instrumentation</ENAMEX> tends toward authentic-sounding fiddles and steel guitars, but
its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neil Young</ENAMEX>--who shows up in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wilco's</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Son Volt</ENAMEX>'s
maundering ballads--and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Byrds</ENAMEX>, whose <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>-rock <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sweetheart</ENAMEX> of the
Rodeo album appears in nearly everything.

            The phrase "alternative <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>" has become as good as hard
cash in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last year</TIMEX>, so desperate is the white pop industry for anything new.
"The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next 10 years</TIMEX> are going to be wild," says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gary Bennett</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> band
BR5-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">49</NUMEX>. His <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> was nominated for a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Grammy</ENAMEX>, and country radio is slowly
picking up its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">singles</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wilco</ENAMEX> has sold <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60,000</NUMEX> copies of its new album, Being
There ; the Old <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">97</TIMEX>'s, another of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">No Depression</ENAMEX> 's frequent causes, has
just been signed to the major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">label Elektra</ENAMEX>.

            
Alternative <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> could be prematurely taxonomized as being made up of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
kinds of bands. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX> there are those whose sheer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">talent</ENAMEX> makes them appealing
to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fans</ENAMEX>. These include the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mavericks</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dwight Yoakam</ENAMEX>, and strict honky-tonk
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">classicists</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BR5-49</ENAMEX>, all of whom strike the difficult balance between
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">professionalism</ENAMEX> and cool, in the hallowed tradition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merle Haggard</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Willie</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nelson</ENAMEX>.

            
Next there are the semilegit crossovers between
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rock</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folk</ENAMEX>--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilco</ENAMEX>, the Old <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">97</TIMEX>'s, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Son Volt</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iris DeMent</ENAMEX>--who adorn
themselves in the trappings of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> but use a studied, shambling rawness to
appeal to rock <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fans</ENAMEX>. Wilco, the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">No Depression</ENAMEX> -approved <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">band</ENAMEX> with the
strongest fan base, swings between down-home sentimentality and rock
aggression: The lyrics to a new song, "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Misunderstood</ENAMEX>," begin with spare piano
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">accompaniment</ENAMEX> and local color ("You're back in your old neighborhood/ where the
cigarettes taste so good") and end with feedback and tantrums ("<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">I'd like to</ENAMEX>
thank you all for nothing at all!").

            Then
there are the true <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">eccentrics</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Catherine Irwin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Janet Beveridge Bean</ENAMEX> are the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">singers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">songwriters</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Freakwater</ENAMEX>, whose recent album, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Old Paint</ENAMEX>
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thrill Jockey</ENAMEX>), is "alternative" by process of elimination, not by design.
Their songs sound like starched and nasal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appalachian</ENAMEX> old-time country music,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unvarnished</ENAMEX> to a fault, and their lyrics are anything but mythopoetic clich√©.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Freakwater</ENAMEX>'s bad-habit songs "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">My Old Drunk Friend" and "Smoking Daddy</ENAMEX>" are
about the anxiety and unglamorousness of bad habits, and consequently
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">believable</ENAMEX> as contemporary songs. They don't respect religion much, either. On
"," they sing: "There's nothing so pure/ as the kindness of an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">atheist</ENAMEX>/ a
simple act of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">unselfishness</ENAMEX>/ that never has to be repaid." Lambchop, a very
quiet <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>-piece <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> fitted out with a trumpet, baritone saxophone, and organ,
as well as the standard <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> setup, has been building a low-budget and
slightly surreal version of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Billy Sherrill</ENAMEX>'s string-swept 1970s country
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">productions</ENAMEX>. Their are slow and graceful, with lulling chord cycles, shimmering
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dynamics</ENAMEX>, and surreal lyrics delivered just above a whisper (as on a recent
full-length album, How I Quit Smoking [<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Merge</ENAMEX>]).

            Finally, there are the amateur ethnographers from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seattle</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Austin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brooklyn</ENAMEX>, and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> of bohemia. This <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX>--bands such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whiskeytown</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moonshine Willy</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Waco Brothers</ENAMEX>--uses
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> as a shock device, a flash of bad taste, and seems to view the genre as
an oppressive religion. The cover of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Angry Johnny and the Killbillies' album</ENAMEX>,
Hankenstein , shows <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hank Williams</ENAMEX> drawn like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frankenstein</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">monster</ENAMEX>; the
cover of a Bloodshot alternative-country anthology called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hell-Bent</ENAMEX>
parodies a famous photo of a grimacing, emaciated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Williams</ENAMEX> in an <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alabama</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">jail</ENAMEX>.
The drawing is by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jon Langford</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Waco Brothers</ENAMEX>--also a founding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mekons</ENAMEX>--and it puts arrows through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Williams</ENAMEX>, so that he's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sebastian</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> drunken starveling.

            
"Alternative" has famously been defined as meaning that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">musicians</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> can't play. BR5-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">49</NUMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mavericks</ENAMEX> place out of the
genre on those grounds. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BR5-49</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arista</ENAMEX>), the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> demonstrates a
grasp of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">1940s</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">1950s</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, down to the grace notes and details, and
invests its songs with so much professionally recycled enthusiasm that a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">listener</ENAMEX> can relearn the dynamics of the old stuff. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mavericks</ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Music</ENAMEX>
for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">All Occasions</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCA</ENAMEX>), clearly possess enough knowledge of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>'s
history to feel ambivalent toward it; but it's such a high-functioning bar band
that it can't be alternative. Freakwater, on the other hand, often leaves you
thinking that it would be great if it just sang its harmonies with a
modicum of timing.

            
One thing clearly absent from a lot of
alternative <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, however, is piety. Traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> is a sidestepping,
roundabout art, fond of coy and cagey divagations. "I'll believe that you still
love me/ when you wear your veil of white," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Williams</ENAMEX> wrote in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1949</TIMEX>. "But you
think that you're above me/ so there'll be no teardrops <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">tonight</TIMEX>." The educated
bohemian atheists behind alternative <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, on the other hand, have no shame
at all. The hell with piety, they say; they'd rather play up <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>'s
self-destructive side: drinking, cheating, and family crackups.

            The problem with all this is
that posturing about <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Southern</ENAMEX> "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">truckstop</ENAMEX>/trailer <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> chic" can sometimes be
little more than that--posturing. A great country <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">singer</ENAMEX> is someone who's been
around the block but can't get to the point in mixed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>. Being punk-blunt
in country music usually yields little more than a cheap lampoon. It's not as
if all this postmodern self-consciousness amounts to anything new. The
country-music business has always marketed a certain nostalgia for itself. The
earliest "hillbilly" recordings had a sort of present-immediately-becoming-past
effect: They purported to be old-timey as soon as they were released. Contrary
to the easily caricatured image of country <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">musicians</ENAMEX> as "the real thing," many
hillbilly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> were as self-conscious as their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pop</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folk counterparts</ENAMEX>. In
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1936</TIMEX>, well before <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">No Depression</ENAMEX> was launched, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carter Family</ENAMEX> recorded
a song called <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">"No Depression in Heaven</ENAMEX>." <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A.P. Carter</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patriarch</ENAMEX>,
was certifiably rural; he grew up in southwestern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poor Valley</ENAMEX>. But
he was no primitive. He was a song collector obsessed with the idea of
recovering <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>'s vanishing oral tradition. The Old <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">97</TIMEX>'s take their name
from "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Wreck of the Old 97</ENAMEX>," a song popularized by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vernon Dalhart</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1924</TIMEX>.
Dalhart, born <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marion Slaughter</ENAMEX>, was the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> of a successful rancher from a
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> port <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. He enrolled at the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dallas Conservatory of Music</ENAMEX>, and sang
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gilbert</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sullivan</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York City</ENAMEX> opera <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> before perceiving that there
was a market in hillbilly songs.

            Not to dismiss this new
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">breed</ENAMEX> of country <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rockers</ENAMEX> altogether. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> culture has always fed off
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-truths about authenticity, and this is the way in which alternative
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> is a genuine expression of something: Hipsters with a sense of ironic
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">detachment</ENAMEX>, like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moonshine Willy</ENAMEX>, have as much claim to the "real"
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> as any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mule-driver</ENAMEX>. Where alternative <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> runs into trouble is its
tendency to ignore what's durable about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> in favor of its stereotypical
<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">hay-bales-and-whiskey-</NUMEX>bottles shtick. At its worst, it's become a new refuge
for the untalented <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">musician</ENAMEX>, a fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ryan Adams</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whiskeytown</ENAMEX>
owns <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">up to</NUMEX> in the song "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Faithless Street</ENAMEX>": "I had started this damn country
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">band/ 'cause</ENAMEX> punk rock was too hard to sing."
