            He's dressed like a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>,
     naked to the waist,
in bottoms like pajamas.
     And hooked by invisible wire
to a monitor hooked to an amplifier.
     All of this on stage,
like intensive care,
     the badge of his connection
at the center of his chest,
     recording and rendering his pulse.
His heart is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dancer</ENAMEX>,
     and its muscle the music
that rises and subsides: each searching
     step, each turn, each somersault
and curl, each sudden rest.
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baryshnikov</ENAMEX> is fifty, but older,
paler, resurrected in the lights.
     You hear his heart
literally leap in the machine-magnified
     <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">midair</ENAMEX>. He won't come down,
then all at once he will.

            When I bend to hear my
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>'
     hearts or lean against a wall
to hear my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX>'s,
     it's like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> in a shell
held tightly to the ear:
     <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">salt</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> and ocean emptiness
and wind, vena cavae, almost still.
     The last thing you want
to hear is the sound
     of your own worn heart.
It has a signature, a rhythm, a silence
     like your voice or fingerprint,
the heartline of the graph
     the abstract of a mountain range
or large waves coming in,
     repeated and repeated and repeated--
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>'s idea of drawing,
     a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>'s obsessive dance or nursery
rhyme yet <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> and years
     of listening to this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>,
who will not change but does.

            When I
remember what it was like
     to see them in the wards,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">impaled</ENAMEX> in bed and wired,
     every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">orifice</ENAMEX> acknowledged,
every innocence corrupted and exposed,
     when I think of the awful
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trembling</ENAMEX> passed by hand,
     the dry white <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemical</ENAMEX> breath
of what was said, the skeletal skin
     so ghostly it seemed they'd already

            gone--that
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">God, in His Mercy</ENAMEX>,
     had pulled their sick hearts out,
bled them, drained them, kissed the dead
     weight from the bones,
that I was looking at myself in rags
     that were my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>--when I think of
them I think of my friend
     with no one there <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">those hours</TIMEX>,
no one to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witness</ENAMEX>, no one to take
     his pulse, no one to talk or listen,
no one to cross his heart.
