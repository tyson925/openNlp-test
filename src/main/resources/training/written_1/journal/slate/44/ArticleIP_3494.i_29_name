            Growing up in a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">suburb</ENAMEX> that
was as new as I was old, I resented the short specimen saplings that dotted our
<ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">lawn</ENAMEX> and the neat rows of perky yellow daffodils that popped up from the wood
chips in the kidney-shaped beds <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each spring</TIMEX>. This was nature? Where were the
ancient groves with thick canopies and filtered light whose mysteries lured the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> I read about in books? I have always been drawn to the drama of
landscape, of wild nature and grand, cultivated gardens. To be able to fashion
beauty from light, scent, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">earth</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flora</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">fauna</ENAMEX>, and then to give it over to
the uncontrollable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> of time and decay seemed an endeavor noble and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">humbling</ENAMEX>. I wanted to make gardens. But I moved to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>.

            Last
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>, when I finally got my own piece of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dirt</ENAMEX> and took a spade to it, it landed
with a thud. The act of gardening itself was joyous--rising early, smelling
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">earth</ENAMEX>, getting dirty, getting scratches that I wore proudly, making compost,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lugging</ENAMEX>, digging, and planting. The result of all this was something else
entirely. The garden I made was a meek little mess, a structureless collection
of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> that never grew from the size at which they entered the ground. While
the mistakes I made were not uncommon ones for a first-time <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gardener</ENAMEX>, I somehow
believed that I was not a first-time <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gardener</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Each weekend</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> I would go
out to toil anew, and well after dark, lit by headlights of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>, I would
realize that pleasure had turned to despair. I grew sullen and ashamed of my
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">surroundings</ENAMEX>. I would be found out.

            While gardening is assumed to be so therapeutic that there
is even a field called horticultural therapy, it wasn't designed to help those
with horticultural problems. I was left to self-analyze. My expectations had
been too high. Worse, I recognized a disparity between my idealized self and my
actual self that I had last observed in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">seventh</NUMEX> grade when I was a gawky
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> with frizzy hair and no breasts and longed to be <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laura Dessner</ENAMEX>, a girl
with a perfect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Farrah Fawcett</ENAMEX> hairdo.

            I waited
for the relief that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> would bring. To most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gardeners</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> is merely the
anticipation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">spring</TIMEX>. They take <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">spring</TIMEX> gardening catalogs with them into the
tub, where they plan their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">coming glories</TIMEX>. They start <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seeds</ENAMEX> in their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">basements</ENAMEX>
to get a jump on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the season</TIMEX>. I was not ready to go there yet. Instead, quite by
accident, I ended up gardening <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all winter</TIMEX>, happily and in private.

            
It started <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last fall</TIMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> when I was
invited to join a "bulb <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">club</ENAMEX>"--a self-consciously pre-feminist all-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> group
that meets to buy bulbs in bulk at reduced rates and exchange bits of gardening
wisdom. Seduced by the descriptions in the catalog, I recklessly bought <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>
that I knew would become deer food if planted outside. Fortunately, the bulb
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ladies</ENAMEX> showed me how to force them into bloom indoors in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX>. Just pot them,
they explained. Jam as many into the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dirt</ENAMEX> as possible, water them, and then
secure them in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ziploc</ENAMEX> bag before sending them off to the cold, dark place
required for dormancy. After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of months</TIMEX>, having been deceived into
thinking they've just slept through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the winter</TIMEX>, they can be brought inside and
made to behave as if <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">spring</TIMEX> has arrived.

            In early
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February</TIMEX>, I brought the bulbs out slowly, a few pots at a time, gently
acclimating them to their new surroundings before offering them the winter
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">sunlight</ENAMEX> from a south-facing window. I lived to watch the progress of these, my
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">darlings</ENAMEX>. I arranged them carefully, watered them dutifully, and checked their
progress constantly, recording their growth rates and bloom times. As someone
who resents houseplants enormously for needing so much and giving so little, I
thought at first that this might be hypocritical. But these potted wonders
changed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX>, stretching and budding and turning toward the sun. They did not
just sit there inert and accusatory, the way houseplants do.

            Hungering for more <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>, I moved on to the woody
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">branches</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">spring</TIMEX>-flowering <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">shrubs</ENAMEX>, tricking them too. Outside I went for long
stems of forsythia. Noticing that a willow <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> cut down <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> had resisted
death, sending up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozens</NUMEX> of shoots from its stump, I cut and forced those too.
Near the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> was a badly-coifed flowering quince that had only a handful of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">lovely flowers</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few days</TIMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one or two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruits</ENAMEX> clinging
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathetically</ENAMEX> in late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX>. Removed from its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>, its limbs were elegant and
stately.

            It went on
for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">bulbs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branches</ENAMEX> rising from slumber into bloom. I would change
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, snip stems, peel back bark, arrange <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>, arrange arrangements, and
stare at them. From the woods I gathered crab <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">apple</ENAMEX>, winterberry, and swamp
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">maple</ENAMEX> that looked promising. Anything with a hint of swollen bud became my
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">prey</ENAMEX>. I also salvaged large pieces of a broad-leaved evergreen that had toppled
in a storm, and put them in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pitcher</ENAMEX>. In came some mysterious blue <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">berries</ENAMEX>
from the side of the road and the orange <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">berries</ENAMEX> of an ugly <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pyracantha</ENAMEX>. Even
the irksome ivy by the front door looked good indoors. At the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">supermarket</ENAMEX>, I
stared for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a long time</TIMEX> at the delectable dark green foliage and deep red stem
and spine of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Swiss chard</NUMEX>. (I resisted.)

            
I was unstoppable, though. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rooms</ENAMEX> brimmed with
buckets filled with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branches</ENAMEX> so large they scraped the ceiling and the walls as
I dragged them to the sink for their changes of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>. Dinner came <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later</TIMEX> and
later as the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen</ENAMEX> was covered in twigs, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branches</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">berries</ENAMEX>.

            As I
write, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> is alive with <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> and foliage, and it is starting to snow
again. An arrangement of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salmon</ENAMEX>-pink quince blossoms is set against the gray
wall of the dining <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>. On the dining table sit <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> terra-cotta pots of
deep-pink <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species tulips</ENAMEX>. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planter</ENAMEX> of yellow tulips with
pale-green markings engulfed by a mass of purple grape hyacinths. Nearby is a
blue <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pitcher</ENAMEX> bursting with sun-yellow forsythia blooms. On the window above the
sink a small container is stuffed with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">bits</NUMEX> of leftovers--the red <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">berries</ENAMEX> of
barberry, small twigs of willow, cuttings of hinoki cypress with its fruits
attached, and the pendulous leathery seed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pods</ENAMEX> of wisteria. On the mantle, an
old iron urn holds cascading ivy and some fragrant <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter honeysuckle</TIMEX>. Next to
that is a small black vase of cut miniature daffodils bought in the supermarket
because I could not bear to harvest any of my own. And on it goes.

            The end of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> is a nebulous time for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gardeners</ENAMEX>--it is
not quite one thing and not quite another. There are clear <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> when you can
skate on the pond and others when you can walk about without a coat. Looking
around for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branches</ENAMEX> to bring home, I see the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">beech trees</ENAMEX> still hanging on to
their frail, colorless <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">leaves</ENAMEX> and notice that the drooping, short-lived <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>
of the maple are about to open. While others are just dreaming of their
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gardens</ENAMEX>, mine is blossoming in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>.
