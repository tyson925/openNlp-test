            A bigger <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garage</ENAMEX>. A cedar
closet. An extra-large laundry <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>. Are these the stuff of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>'s dreams?
Traditional 
               <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Home</ENAMEX> , a home-design <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> for suburban <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> of
childbearing age, thinks so. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> surveyed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">800</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> to find out what
they wanted in their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX>. Some of the questions were about things: What's at
the top of your wish list? What would be in your dream <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>? Others were about
feelings: What do you like about your home? Would you move? Who really makes
the decisions?

            Not
surprisingly, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> wanted more storage space, maybe a whirlpool bath, and
could foresee a day when their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> would feel like empty nests or crowded
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">houses</ENAMEX>. Electronics were low on their lists. But the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> were also attached
to their domiciles, however imperfect. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Eighty-two percent</NUMEX> said their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> were
most like "a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX>, a place to relax." A majority said they were the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">decision-makers</ENAMEX>, where the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> was concerned, and that they wanted to stay
put.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Traditional Home</ENAMEX> then offered its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> a solution
to their dilemmas: a less-than-traditional home--a "flexible <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX>"--that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> could change easily as their needs changed, without remodeling or
moving. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Readers</ENAMEX> loved the idea (they voiced doubts mainly about the cost), and
so <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Traditional</ENAMEX> 
               Home entered the home-building <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX>. The
"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Built by Women</ENAMEX>" project, a model <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> designed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>,
incorporates the survey responses into plans for a dream <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX>'s
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November</TIMEX> issue gave <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> look at room layouts and façades for the
project, and the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January</TIMEX> issue offers <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>-by-room photos of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>,
built in a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">suburb</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Editor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karol DeWulf Nickell</ENAMEX> will be offering a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">satellite</ENAMEX> tour as well. Already some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX>, for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">just $1,500</NUMEX>, are buying the
plans to build these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> themselves.

            The Built
by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Women</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>, designed by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Margaret McCurry</ENAMEX>, comes with
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> façade options: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New England</ENAMEX> clapboard, ever trendy <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tudor</ENAMEX>, and a yellow
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> brick. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> subdivisions offer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> with similar basic
historical touches--wrought-iron porch, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-timbers above the door--but leave
the front <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wall fortress-like</ENAMEX>, with a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garage</ENAMEX> door, a front door, and a small
lookout window the only apertures. "I was in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Phoenix</ENAMEX> recently, looking at a
subdivision with new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> where there was a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-car <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garage</ENAMEX> in front and the
front door--no other window on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCurry</ENAMEX> said. "I could drive into
that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> and kidnap a little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> and no one would see." <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCurry</ENAMEX> adds
windows to let <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> watch the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> as they read, work, or clean: both a
security system for a paranoid age and a symbol of the old-fashioned <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX>
dream--picture window, pastel drapes, and all.

            
From the outside, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Built by Women</ENAMEX> is merely a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sturdier</ENAMEX> version of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">builders</ENAMEX> slap down outside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>, planting
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">spindly trees</ENAMEX> by the driveway and calling it "landscaping." There
are no communal kitchens or marble <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bathrooms</ENAMEX>; that's not what the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> in the
survey wanted. Instead, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCurry</ENAMEX> wanted to give <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> that makes their
day-to-day routine comfortable. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Readers</ENAMEX> who had recently built or remodeled
said their homes reflected their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designers</ENAMEX>' fancies, not their own needs:
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Counters</ENAMEX> were too high, misplaced lights cast shadows when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> applied their
makeup, there was more space for formal entertaining than for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> dinners.
Not so in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCurry</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Readers</ENAMEX> said they wanted the areas where they spent
the most time to have space and light, so <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCurry</ENAMEX> has provided a spacious
laundry <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>, generous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hallways</ENAMEX>, a living <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> that's small enough to
straighten easily but large enough to fit the whole <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>.

            The women
surveyed did want to retain some ceremonial space, so there's a formal front
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hall</ENAMEX> and parlor off the double-height <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">foyer</ENAMEX> in the model <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>. But otherwise
the emphasis is on the practical. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bathrooms</ENAMEX>, the stairs, and large closets
are packed into a strip down the center of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sets of three
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> are lined up on either side. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garage</ENAMEX> fits within the rectangular
footprint of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>, but along the side, so it no longer dominates the front
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen</ENAMEX> is positioned between the family <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> and the dining
room, separated by swinging doors. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>'s playroom is upstairs and over
the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garage</ENAMEX>, so the rugrats can jump up and down to their hearts' content.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Built by Women</ENAMEX> house sounds superficially like the
"open plan," the vogue in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s</TIMEX>, that was also supposed to offer ultimate
flexibility. But the open plan proved less permanent than the lava lamp. No one
wanted just a folding screen between the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>'s and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedrooms</ENAMEX>. No
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> wanted to read a book in a drafty multipurpose area. That was for swingers,
always planning their next key <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">1990s</NUMEX> flexible <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> is all about
family. Family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> can retreat to their own <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX>, insulated from warring
musical tastes by <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hallways</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bathrooms</ENAMEX>, and closets. They have their own
entrances: a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mother-in-law suite</ENAMEX> on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> floor, a back door for dirty
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>, a front door for <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> impressions. The entire <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> can come together
around the dinner table, restored to central status from its incarnation as a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nook</ENAMEX> or a counter. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCurry</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> has lots of doorways and entrances, so that
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother-in-law</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> can find their own way to the dining <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> at
dinner time, or exit when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> need more privacy. The living <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> can be
a home-entertainment <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> are young (it is well insulated, so
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barney</ENAMEX> need not take over the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>) and then a home <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> in the empty-nest
stage (it's wired for the Internet).

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Built by Women</ENAMEX> model home
encloses a clear theory about keeping your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> intact. Old-style feminism
would have quarreled with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Traditional</ENAMEX> 
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Home</ENAMEX> 's premise that women
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cared</ENAMEX> (and wanted to care) more about their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> do, and rejected the
idea that the new-style "dream <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>" would involve more space for housework.
But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX>'s contribution, feminist in its own way, is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX> of a
plan that allows each <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> to have another function depending on the age of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX>, their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>--<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">service</ENAMEX> of family
unity. The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Built by Women</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX> is like a new wardrobe, with all the promise of
the early <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donna Karan</ENAMEX>: a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> that fits, and stretches, and won't go out of
style. Built by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Women</ENAMEX>'s goal is to put the average <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> in a house
that suits, for as long as possible.
