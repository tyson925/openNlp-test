            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Emily Dickinson</ENAMEX> is a stern,
maybe even a harsh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poet</ENAMEX>. The richness of language, image, and imagination all
contrast with her austerities and stringencies: Nothing could be further from
the beloved <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">middlebrow</ENAMEX> notion of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dickinson</ENAMEX> as a charmingly dotty, fey spinster
or wistful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX>, all eccentricity and repression.

            The homely
domestic details of this poem, the shawl and the vase, convey a dire, steely
perception: that life's sweetness may run out long before the duties. Here is
no benign affirmation of redemption. On the other hand, there is something in
her clarity on this point, her ferocity of truth, and her firm sense that it is
her duty to carry on, that I find exhilarating. Even the dashes, with their
suspended, rising quality, suggest the vitality of endurance.

            I tie my <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Hat</ENAMEX>--I crease my
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shawl</ENAMEX>--<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Life</ENAMEX>'s little duties do--precisely--As the very least Were infinite--to
me--

            I put new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Blossoms</ENAMEX> in the
Glass--And throw the old--away--I push a petal from my GownThat anchored
there--I weighThe time 'twill be till <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">six o'clockI</NUMEX> have so much to do--And
yet--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Existence</ENAMEX>--some way back--Stopped--struck--my ticking--through--We cannot
put <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ourself</ENAMEX> awayAs a completed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ManOr Woman</ENAMEX>--When the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Errand</ENAMEX>'s doneWe came to
Flesh--upon--There may be--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miles</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miles</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nought</ENAMEX>--Of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Action</ENAMEX>--sicker far--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">To</ENAMEX>
simulate--is stinging work--To cover what we areFrom <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Science</ENAMEX>--and from
Surgery<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">--Too Telescopic EyesTo beat</ENAMEX> on us unshaded--For their--sake--not for
Ours--'Twould start them--We--could tremble--But since we got a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bomb</ENAMEX>--And held
it in our <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bosom--Nay</ENAMEX>--Hold it--it is calm--

            Therefore--we do life's
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">labor</ENAMEX>--Though life's <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Reward</ENAMEX>--be done--With scrupulous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">exactness</ENAMEX>--To hold our
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senses</ENAMEX>--on--
