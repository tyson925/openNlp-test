            Like most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gardeners</ENAMEX>
can be categorized as liberal or conservative. It is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">liberals</ENAMEX> who concern
me. Their hearts may be in the right place but, as a result of attachment to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dogma</ENAMEX> and oversimplification of facts, there is much that they fail to
understand. Since they are the majority, and their views the predominant ones,
I feel compelled to come forward on behalf of my fellow politically incorrect
gardening <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">compatriots</ENAMEX>.

            Liberal
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gardeners</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who feel that, through gardening, we can alleviate our
sense of alienation from nature; and that, through good gardening, we can
repair some of the damage we have done to our environment. The most extreme
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">liberals</ENAMEX> believe that there is an original or a natural <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> in which the
environment would be if we hadn't shown up on the scene, and that we have not
only the ability but also a moral imperative to help nature return to this
state. Remember <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the '70s</TIMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> were turning their suburban <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">lawns</ENAMEX> loose
and allowing them to aspire to being meadows? They were letting the grass
express its natural inclination toward longness and reduced greenness, while
their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> were handing them citations demanding a return to neatness and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neighborliness</ENAMEX>. This liberation of grass struggling to be free was yet another
response to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>/nature divide that has worried <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">liberals</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX>. The
basic idea is that nature is good, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> is not, and the more we can keep the
beastly hand of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> out of things, the better.

            The liberal solution is what has come to be known as a
"natural garden." Judging from the looks of it, it might more properly be
called a "naturalistic garden." These gardens contain many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> cribbed
from nature herself, such as sinuous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">paths</ENAMEX>, free-form ponds, curvy clumps of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">shrubs</ENAMEX>, and squiggly planting beds. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Curvilinearness</ENAMEX> is believed to be next to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">godliness</ENAMEX>. A walk or a drive up to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> or through the garden should bend
and wind and provide a "sense of journey," as one might experience on a walk in
the woods. Such a garden may even contain a craggy-ledged waterfall or some
other wonder of the natural world. Sometimes, if the garden seems very
"natural," as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Central Park</ENAMEX> is meant to, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> may even mistake their
experience for one in nature. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frederick Law Olmsted</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX>,
is no <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hero</ENAMEX> to our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">liberals</ENAMEX>, for he committed the unforgivable sin of using
"exotics"--<ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> of foreign origin come to mingle on our virgin terrain.
"Natural gardening" is a strictly regional affair, done with those <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> that
thrived in a particular area--around say, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Des Moines</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dubuque</ENAMEX>--before the
fall of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>. (This type of gardening came into vogue in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1980s</TIMEX> as the
gardening <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">environmentalists</ENAMEX>' response to the excesses of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that decade</TIMEX>. It
incorporated the teachings of the organic-gardening movement and spun them not
only with lessons about water conservation and ecosystems but also with the
promotion of natural-seeming styles and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>.)

            So, after setting their turf
free, natural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gardeners</ENAMEX> began to regard the chemical- and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>-dependent lawn
as a villainous expression of suburban <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>'s environmental insensitivity, and
turned against it entirely. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Grass</ENAMEX> was yanked out by its roots and tossed onto
the compost heap. Those offending areas are now populated by happy natives
thriving in their xeroscapes in xenophobic splendor. Presumably these
<ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">indigenous plants</ENAMEX> refrain from sending their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seed</ENAMEX> downwind into other areas
where they do not belong. But can we be sure that any "native" <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> was not
merely brought into alien territory on the sandal-sole of an unwitting nomad
long ago?

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitchell</ENAMEX>, the late, great, and I think, conservative garden <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> (he smoked
cigarettes in his garden, an act incomprehensible to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">liberals</ENAMEX>), poked fun at
those who think they garden in "a natural way." That, he claimed, could be seen
in "any desert, any swamp, any leech-filled laurel hell." <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gardening</ENAMEX>, on the
other hand, was for him the "high defiance of nature herself." <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nature</ENAMEX> has no
patience for your garden. She wants to reclaim it, and if you turn your back on
it for a moment, she'll be there, with <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">weeds</ENAMEX> and vines and tangled brush. It is
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, not gardens, who are found in nature. And because we
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">conservatives</ENAMEX> view ourselves as part of nature--albeit a quirky, self-conscious
bit of it--we feel we have the honor and privilege of tussling with it.

            
Where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">liberals</ENAMEX> are moralists, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conservatives</ENAMEX> are
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aesthetes</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gardens</ENAMEX>, particularly flower gardens, serve no real purpose. If
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gardens</ENAMEX> must have a higher calling, it is the cause of beauty. Failing to
recognize the primacy of aesthetics in gardening, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">liberals</ENAMEX> are left vulnerable
to all sorts of unnecessary errors, such as using bark mulch as a decorative
element. This can lead you down the slippery slope toward <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> artlessly
plunked down in an unrepentant mishmash, the garden equivalent of an unshaven
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">armpit</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Conservatives</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">lawns</ENAMEX>,
especially when we call them tapis verts . We like topiary, pollarded
<ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>, all√©es , bosques, exotic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>, and formal rigor. Of course, we
may also love wildness, meadows, indigenous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>, woods--we are not without
our libertarian inclinations--but not exclusively or senselessly. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gardening</ENAMEX> is
ultimately a folly whose goal is to provide delight. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">liberal</ENAMEX> may look at a
boxwood <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bunny</ENAMEX> frozen in mid-hop and see only a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> in bondage. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Conservatives</ENAMEX>
love gardens because they are artifice. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan Kiley</ENAMEX>, one of the most
important landscape <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architects</ENAMEX> of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20 th century</TIMEX>, creates
landscapes based on a grid. His belief is that we should not shy away from
geometry in the design and layout of gardens, since the entire cosmos is based
on it. To garden in this way is to copy the spirit of nature, not its
letter.

            The most slanderous thing
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">liberals</ENAMEX> say about <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conservatives</ENAMEX> is that we are not sufficiently concerned
about the environment. We, too, are concerned. We just express our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> in a
different way. Imagine Nature looking down at what we have made at, say,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Versailles</ENAMEX>, and also at a low-maintenance ornamental grass planting around a
boggy pond. Which would it feel was a more fitting testament to its mysteries
and strength?
