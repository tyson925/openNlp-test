            Sometimes
you read a preface by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> who doesn't seem to have absorbed the book he
purports to be introducing. In his opening remarks for <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Eyes of the Nation: A</ENAMEX>
Visual History of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Librarian</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James H.</ENAMEX>
Billington strikes a fondly nationalistic note: "What makes the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
narrative unique is the ability we have displayed time and again to remedy our
mistakes, to adjust to changing circumstances, to debate and then move on in
directions that seem better for all." These words, which might be appropriate
for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time-Life</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX>-table volume titled, say, We 
               the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX>! ,
seriously misrepresent the downbeat, contemplative collaboration of picture
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vincent Virga</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">historian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Brinkley</ENAMEX>. Far from being a celebratory
collection of inspiring <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> images, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Eyes of the Nation</ENAMEX> is--in
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stretches</ENAMEX>, at least--a lavishly illustrated bad trip through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">500 years</TIMEX> of
heavy-handed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> building. Though it's hard to sustain a point of view when
the goal is to be best-selling and definitive, the book's reigning mood is
progressive populism tempered by realistic pessimism.

            After a bit of visual
throat-clearing, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Eyes of the Nation</ENAMEX> begins in earnest with a drawing of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Secota</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Roanoke Island</ENAMEX> in what would become North
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Carolina</ENAMEX>. It shows neat rows of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">corn</ENAMEX>. Ceremonial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dancers</ENAMEX>. A central
marketplace. The drawing, done by an expedition <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mate</ENAMEX> of Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter Raleigh</ENAMEX>'s,
portrays the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of native grace that the rest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">"Encounter</ENAMEX>,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1492-1600</TIMEX>") depicts a falling away from. The emphasis is on <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> ignorance,
backed by engravings of fanciful New World monsters and references to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Tempest</ENAMEX> , a play inspired by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">explorers</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX>. The
rise of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> conflict marks the exit from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eden</ENAMEX>: "From the moment the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">rivals</ENAMEX> began fighting among themselves for territory, ... the security
of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Secotan</ENAMEX> came to an end." What follows is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several</NUMEX> pages ("The
Garden"), linked thematically rather than chronologically, picturing
<ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">sunflowers</ENAMEX>, rattlesnakes, and bison. The color plates are pretty, the captions
neutral and informative, but the metaphorical message is sharp: Behold what was
lost. <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 2</ENAMEX> drives home the point. Titled "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The World Turn'd Upside Down</ENAMEX>,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1600-1800</TIMEX>," it opens with an apocalyptic watercolor, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>: A
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prophecy</ENAMEX> , by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Blake</ENAMEX>.

            Though it resembles a
standard high-school history text, with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapters</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Civil War</ENAMEX>, immigration,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">imperial</ENAMEX> expansion, and so on, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Eyes of the Nation</ENAMEX> is a book one flips
through, not a book <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> views and reads in sequence. It speaks through clusters
of words and images, not through argument and exposition. Open to Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">240</NUMEX>, for
example, and you'll find stills from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">D.W. Griffith</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intolerance</ENAMEX>
juxtaposed with a pencil sketch of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lincoln</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Monument</ENAMEX> and, on the facing
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">page</ENAMEX>, a photograph of a charred and limbless lynched black male surrounded by
smiling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX> in coats and ties. combine a black-and-white shot of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Dust Bowl</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX>, a fertile <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> tomato field captured by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward Weston</ENAMEX>, and a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Technicolor Emerald City</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Wizard of Oz</ENAMEX> . The ironies aren't
always as blunt as these, but in general it is tension, not harmony, that
governs the arrangements.

            
The richest part of the book is its middle.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Visually</ENAMEX>, there are just more sparks to strike after the invention of the
camera and the flowering of modern advertising. The writing brightens, too.
Brinkley, a highly class-conscious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">historian</ENAMEX>, is better at robber <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">barons</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">depressions</ENAMEX>, strikes, and grass-roots politics than at wars and natural
history. He knows how to isolate cultural decision points--the moment, say,
when the populist cause was lost and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Jennings Bryan</ENAMEX> became a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fool</ENAMEX>--and
how to pin down such phantom <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> as social conformity between the wars and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern</ENAMEX> agrarian idealism. Though <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brinkley</ENAMEX>'s sympathies clearly lie with the
progressives, he has a knack for portraying reactionaries. His <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Klansmen</ENAMEX> and
red-baiters are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, too--not just bigots but also misguided dreamers. And
though <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hindsight</ENAMEX> sometimes breeds determinism, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brinkley</ENAMEX> is alert to alternative
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">histories</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">paths</ENAMEX> just barely not taken. The book concludes in orthodox
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">multiculturalism</ENAMEX> and a surprisingly bitter estimate of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>'s democratic
potential: "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">America</ENAMEX> approached <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the century's end</TIMEX> as fractured along social,
racial, ethnic, economic, gender, and regional lines as it had been in all but
a few moments in its history; with a culture so diverse and so contentious that
it seemed to lack any coherence or shape; with declining faith in its
government, its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX>, and its principal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX>." The facing page shows
a picture of a brick wall scratched full of chalk marks tallying enemy deaths
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Gulf War</ENAMEX>.

            Less conventionally ambitious, and possibly more affecting
because of it, is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Lesy</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dreamland</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Dawn</ENAMEX> of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Twentieth Century</ENAMEX> , a collection of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">turn-of-the-century</TIMEX> photographic
postcards that are both graphically gorgeous and spiritually haunting. Silvery
and immaculate, with hallucinatory depth and detail, the pictures of Western
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mines</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eastern</ENAMEX> skyscrapers, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cotton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">fields</ENAMEX> and battleships, boomtown main
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> and metropolitan train <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stations</ENAMEX> have a strangely deserted
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday-</TIMEX><TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> feel, as if they represented <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first day</TIMEX>, or perhaps the last,
of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> modernity.

            The first thing one notices,
paging through the book, is that objects, both natural and man-made, looked
larger and more heroic in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">those days</TIMEX>, if only because the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> were fewer.
Call it <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the age of titanic</TIMEX> capitalism. Shots of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Flatiron Building</ENAMEX> under
construction are weirdly short on human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">passersby</ENAMEX>, implying that the growth
required to fill the place is still a hopeful article of faith, not yet a
practical reality. That the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Century</ENAMEX> was built before the bulk of its
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tenants</ENAMEX> had arrived is one of those facts that shouldn't be any surprise but
comes as a revelation nonetheless.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lesy</ENAMEX>'s text--a filled-in time
line that notes such events as the founding of department <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX>, the rise of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX> and financial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX>, and the erection of famous public
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">monuments</ENAMEX>--creates, in combination with the pictures, a retrospective mood that
isn't nostalgia but a finer, more elevated yearning. The sadness is not for
what was, or even for what might have been, but for what always comes between
the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>--the feeling of being in the eternal, dream-absorbing, imperfect
present. On Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> there's a shot of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">schoolboys</ENAMEX> admiring a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sidewalk</ENAMEX>
assortment of metal windup toys. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX>, who looks wiser than his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>,
glares at the camera, seemingly aware that his image is being delivered to the
future. He appears to anticipate, and resent, our patronizing spying. He
doesn't like us. We're from now and he's from way back when and he already
seems to know we've let him down.
