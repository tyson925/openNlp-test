            Shaping a vessel in which to
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">boil water</ENAMEX> shouldn't be that difficult--more a matter of "duh" than design. All
you need is a place to put the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, a handle that doesn't get hot, and a
spout that is well away from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX>'s hand. You can refine it by maximizing
the surface that touches the burner, putting a whistle at the end of the spout,
and providing a lever to open the spout. And what you have is a functional--if
visually graceless--design, one that was perfected <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a century ago</TIMEX> and is
now ubiquitous and inexpensive.

            In recent
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, though, the mundane teakettle has become something else: an opportunity
for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designers</ENAMEX> to show off--and, sometimes, an object lesson in how easy it is
for them to mess up. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX>'s kettle can often serve up a searing demonstration
(searing to your fingers, that is) of how risky it is to redesign ordinary
objects. Such things often work so well that you don't even notice the parts of
their design that make them work so well. Sometimes, things look clunky for
good reason.

            You can buy a kettle whose whistle is in the shape of a
brass-plated nightingale or a steam-spewing <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dragon</ENAMEX>. One has a handle in the
shape of a bent tulip. There are <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">kettles</ENAMEX> shaped like some of the major Platonic
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">solids</ENAMEX>--cylinders, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cones</ENAMEX>, and near-spheres. They come fluted like a Doric
column and mottled and horned like a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Holstein cow</ENAMEX>. And <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>--the best of the
lot--sports a large plastic collar to ensure that you won't burn your fingers,
no matter how clumsy you are.

            The distant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">precursors</ENAMEX> to
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designer kettles</ENAMEX> were the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cane</ENAMEX>-handled electric teakettles designed in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1908</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Behrens</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AEG</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> version of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Electric</ENAMEX>. These
small appliances, with their clear round or octagonal shapes, subtle texture,
and almost handcrafted look, were never sold in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. But
photographs of them have been published and exhibited, and they represent an
important step in the transfer of aesthetic interest from the teapot--with its
long decorative history--to the kettle, which genteel <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> had kept out of
sight.

            But in
recent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX>, even as the amount of time <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> spend cooking has shrunk to
nearly nothing, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kitchens</ENAMEX> have become increasingly ostentatious. It was probably
inevitable that the functional but dowdy model of the baby boom era would be
replaced with something more stylish.

            
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1983</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">housewares</ENAMEX> manufacturer
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alessi</ENAMEX> introduced what is probably still the most outrageous teakettle ever
made, the creation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Sapper</ENAMEX>. Its vertical, domed
shape has a certain hauteur, not to mention a geometric purity then rare in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">housewares</ENAMEX>. And it doesn't merely whistle when the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> starts to steam. It
plays a note, then a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> note, and finally an insistent <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-note chord
with a sound somewhere between a train whistle and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canadian Brass</ENAMEX>. Selling
for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 20</NUMEX> times the price of an ordinary model, the kettle quickly
became a cult object for design-conscious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Gleaming,</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">elegant</ENAMEX>, substantial, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sapper</ENAMEX> design achieves its visual power at some
expense. Its burner surface is low in relation to its volume, so it boils water
more slowly than other <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX>. Its chief failing, however, is that it allows
you to easily pull the spout lever and release a plume of steam--aimed directly
at your fingers.

            A design that departs radically from the ordinary may look
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">great</ENAMEX> in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> but fail in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen</ENAMEX>. But that doesn't mean it can't do
well in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> don't get a chance to boil <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sapper</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">design</ENAMEX> paved the way for what is still the most iconic kettle of all: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michael</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Graves</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">"Five O'Clock</ENAMEX>" teakettle, designed for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alessi</ENAMEX> and introduced in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1985</TIMEX>,
is conical in shape, with a long spout. Its most distinctive feature is the
little pink ceramic bird at the end of its removable whistle. This removable
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">whistle</ENAMEX> was actually a throwback to the earliest version of the whistling
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">teakettle</ENAMEX>.

            The
chirping-bird kettle seemed to prove that high design could also be cute.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Graves</ENAMEX> explained the little <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pink bird</ENAMEX> as a reaction to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sapper</ENAMEX>'s kettle. Because
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bird</ENAMEX> doesn't get hot, he said, it is possible to remove the whistling cap
without burning your fingers. There is a danger that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bird</ENAMEX> might crack and
break, but it can easily be replaced.

            
The little <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bird</ENAMEX> is what told housewares
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturers</ENAMEX> that teakettles could be a hot commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">item</ENAMEX> and led to the
current proliferation. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Graves</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> is still available, for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $125</NUMEX>,
though some might call it pass√©. It has been superseded by newer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX>, all
less expensive--and, for the most part, less memorable.

            The
exception is the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">OXO Good Grips teakettle</ENAMEX>, designed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX> Smart
Design and introduced <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX>. It is part of a line of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">products</ENAMEX> intended to
be usable by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX> or hand injuries, as well as by those
without disabilities. It is the ultimate answer to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sapper</ENAMEX>'s kettle, because its
form was generated by the desire to make it extremely difficult for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> to
burn their fingers.

            Though it lacks the simple, geometric form of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sapper</ENAMEX>'s pot
and those of many of its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">competitors</ENAMEX>, it is unified in a subtler way. Its
complex curves suggest that it was sculpted rather than drawn. You can think of
it as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> intersecting incomplete egg shapes, one of which is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pot</ENAMEX> and the handle of its lid and the other of which is the protective collar.
The lines of the handle and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements derive</ENAMEX> from these implicit shapes.
(It doesn't photograph well; it is one of those rare products that looks better
than its picture on the box.)

            When I <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> saw the OXO
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">kettle</ENAMEX>, I resisted it. That big black steam <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guard</ENAMEX> looked so ostentatiously
foolproof that I feared it would be clumsy, like a bicycle with training
wheels. But as I handled it, used it, and carefully examined how it worked, it
started to look better and better. This is indeed progress, both aesthetically
and functionally--even though all it does is boil <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>.
