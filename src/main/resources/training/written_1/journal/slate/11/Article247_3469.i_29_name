            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dear Kara</ENAMEX>,

            OK, I'll bite. How will the Internet become the "most important
communications medium of all time"? How will it sweep away ignorance about
racial hatred or empower <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to take control of their lives? It seems to me
that the Internet can foment hate and/or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">herd</ENAMEX> mentality just as easily at
it can foment tolerance and/or empowerment. I have to put my cards on the table
here: I'm really skeptical of the claims that I hear all around me about how
the Internet is going to change the world as we know it.

            Let me lay out some of the reasons for my skepticism. First, from a purely
historical point of view, I don't see how anyone can view the Internet as more
important than any number of communications <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> that have preceded it: the
printing press, the telegraph, the telephone, the phonograph <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">player</ENAMEX>, the
television among them. To my mind, the Internet is demonstrably less
important--less transforming, if you will--than any of these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">predecessors</ENAMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Secondly</NUMEX>, more often than not, powerful new technologies don't live up to their
supposed "true" potential. Here, of course, television is the prime example.
Look back at the claims that were made for television during its formative
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, and they sound a lot like the claims being made now for the Internet.
Would anyone claim <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> that television has changed our society? Well, yes,
they would--but not in the enlightened fashion that its proselytizers had once
hoped.

            I know you're not supposed to say this out loud--at least not on a
respectable Web site like this one--but I think the Internet has a way of
bringing out the worst in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> rather than the best. The anonymity it allows
emboldens <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to say things to each other they would never say face to face.
There are at least as many sites for nuts as there are for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> trying to
make the world a better place. Everything has to be short and quick. And even
some Web ideas that started out as utopian have been subverted over time. The
example I know best is that of the chat <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> devoted to particular stocks,
which were supposed to be informative, illuminating places, filled with
like-minded <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> trying to help each other and educate each other about
stocks. And what happened? Chat <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> have become astonishingly intolerant
places, where anyone who dares dissent from the general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rah-rah tenor</ENAMEX> is
branded a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traitor</ENAMEX> and pretty much hounded out of the site. As you know, they've
also become havens for fraud, abuse, and all sorts of dirty shenanigans. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> or
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three years ago</TIMEX>, I made a point of checking the chat room whenever I began a
story about a particular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>. Now I don't bother; it's just a waste of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>.

            I'll go a step further.

            Even from a business point of view--which is the focus of most of the hype
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these days</TIMEX>--I think the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Web</ENAMEX> is more likely to disappoint than not. Without
question, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amazon.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX> are eating into the profits of "bricks and
mortar" <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barnes & Noble</ENAMEX>, and will undoubtedly continue to do
so. But the reason <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Amazon</ENAMEX>'s stock is such a high-flyer is that there is a
widespread expectation that someday <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Amazon</ENAMEX> will be a gigantically profitable
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">corporation</ENAMEX> itself. But why will this ever happen? There will always be some
other Web site offering <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> a better deal than <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Amazon</ENAMEX>--get a free PC with
the purchase of your next book!--and the Web allows <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> something that
has heretofore existed only in economics textbooks: "perfect knowledge"--the
ability to know every price that exists for the good you want to buy. That's
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">empowerment</ENAMEX>, all right; no question about it. But it's not the kind of
empowerment Internet stock <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> like to talk about. So do I use the
Internet? All the time. It's part of my life. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">The past few weeks</TIMEX>, in fact, I
was on vacation on a lake in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>, where I had little access to television or
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX>. I spent a little time <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each day</TIMEX> logging on to the New
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">York Times</ENAMEX> , 
                  Slate
               , and Yahoo!, just to see what was
going on. I was glad I could do it. But is that an earth-shattering advance? I
don't think so. Needless to say (he hastens to add) all of the above is offered
in the spirit of good, healthy debate. Glad I got that out of my system,
though. Looking forward to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX>'s correspondence.

            Best,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe</ENAMEX>
