            Brilliant, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tony</ENAMEX>, brilliant! I love your interpretation of the wizard world
as parallel to the gay world--the young <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">wizard</ENAMEX>'s gradual recognition of his
difference, the sudden revelation that there are <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">tons</NUMEX> of other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> like him.
Do you see a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Magic Pride</ENAMEX> movement starting, with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witches</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wizards</ENAMEX> insisting
that muggles accept them and grant them civil rights? I'm longing to go to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Magic Pride</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX>--imagine the floats and costumes!

            I like your idea of foreign wizardry, too. Did you ever read <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kingdoms</ENAMEX> of
Elfin , by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sylvia Townsend Warner</ENAMEX>? It's another out-of-print work of genius
that could plausibly come back on the wind of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harry</ENAMEX>'s success. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> wrote a
series of stories--I think, but I'm not sure, that a lot of them were published
in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The New Yorker</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the '70s</TIMEX>--about <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fairies</ENAMEX> living in
various <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>. They're partly exquisite little parodies of travel lit,
partly cruel little fables. As usual, try getting a grown-up to read them--you
can hear them muttering "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fairies</ENAMEX>? Come on!" in their heads. But these stories
are certainly not <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>'s literature: The fairies are heartless and creepy
(which makes them human enough that they're weirdly touching). In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Elfhame</ENAMEX>, in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Scotland</ENAMEX>, here's how they treat changelings:

            

               <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Every day</TIMEX> a fasting weasel bites the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>'s neck and drinks its <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> for
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three minutes</TIMEX>. The amount of blood drunk by each successive weasel (who is
weighed before and after the drinking) is replaced by the same weight of a
distillation of dew, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">soot</ENAMEX>, and aconite. Though the blood-to-ichor transfer does
not cancel human nature (the distillation is only approximate: elfin blood
contains several unanalyzable components, one of which is believed to be
magnetic air), it gives considerable longevity; ... "Dear little thing," said
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tiphaine</ENAMEX> [the queen of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Elfhame</ENAMEX>; all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX>'s elfin kingdoms are matriarchies].
"I hope he won't age prematurely." For when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grey hairs</ENAMEX> appear on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of a
changeling he is put out of the hill to make the rest of his way through the
human world; which is why we see so many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grey-haired beggars</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX>.

            

            Or this:

            

               The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Elfin Court of Zuy</ENAMEX>, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Low Countries</ENAMEX>, was wealthy and orderly. No
winter gales penetrated its polished windows; if the summer sun shone too
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">vehemently</ENAMEX>, blinds were pulled down to protect the furnishings. Drinking bouts
were long, taciturn, and ended in somnolence. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Queen</ENAMEX> was celebrated for her
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pearls</ENAMEX>.

            

            It would be fun to take a school trip with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hogwarters</ENAMEX> and see what
details <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rowling</ENAMEX> would assemble to build national styles of wizardry. But I
think your other scenario--a foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> joins <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hogwarts</ENAMEX>--is much more
likely. <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Notice</ENAMEX> how <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rowling</ENAMEX> structures the books in strict parallel centered
around the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>: <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX> we get a few chapters of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harry</ENAMEX> at home with his awful
muggle <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX>, who lock him in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">closet</ENAMEX>, starve him, and cower at the
thought that he might perform magic (his frustration at not being allowed to is
part of the amusement of this section). Then we get a visit to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diagon Alley</ENAMEX>, a
hidden <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witches</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wizards</ENAMEX> shop for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX>'s school
supplies. Then the trip to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hogwarts</ENAMEX>, generally on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hogwarts Express</ENAMEX>, which
leaves from the invisible <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Platform Nine and Three-Quarters at King</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cross</ENAMEX>. At
Hogwarts, we get the rhythms of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the school year</TIMEX>: the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX>, new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX>,
spells gone wrong, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midnight feasts</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quidditch</ENAMEX> competitions, bad marks for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mischief</ENAMEX>, exams, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> break, and so on. At some point, usually the climax,
we visit the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Forbidden Forest</ENAMEX>, a spot of hazard and wonder, right on school
grounds. What's amazing is how <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rowling</ENAMEX> manages to cleave strictly to this
formula, yet provide such a wealth of new details and such deep, dangerous
plots that every book seems completely new. It's a trick other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have
used--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">P.L. Travers</ENAMEX>, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Poppins</ENAMEX> books, for example, always has a
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">chapter</ENAMEX> in which one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> loses her temper, one in which we visit a
relative of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Poppins</ENAMEX>' for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX>, one in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary</ENAMEX> has a birthday, and so on.
But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rowling</ENAMEX> isn't just writing independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapters</ENAMEX>--her novels have an overall
trajectory that deepens and develops from book to book. It's as if she's
writing a sequence of sonnets.

            (Not a succubus, by the way. A succubus is a female demon that comes to you
in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the night</TIMEX> while you're asleep and has sex with you against your will. I was
thinking of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">monster</ENAMEX> that looks like an ordinary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>, until you see her
legs--which she doesn't have. Instead, there's a snake tail, or a puddle of
oozing rot. I've seen her called a melusine, but I think there's another name.
Maybe one of our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> can think of it?)

            I'm still interested in hearing your thoughts about the question you posed a
few messages back: Why <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harry</ENAMEX>, why now?

            Best,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Polly</ENAMEX>
