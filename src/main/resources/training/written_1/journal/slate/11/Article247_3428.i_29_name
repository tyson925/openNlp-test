            A difference between you and me that transcends right vs. left is that you
take electoral politics more seriously than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">I.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX> vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> is a
politics of small differences at this point. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> is basically being run
by global <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporations</ENAMEX> that, aside from their direct economic influence on who
gets elected and what they do when they get elected (a large aside), control
economic policy by essentially saying to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> on all levels, federal,
state, and local, give us fiscal austerity, low taxes, and less regulation or
we a) will take our jobs elsewhere and b) won't lend you money. In general I
prefer <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX> because they're not beholden to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">right</ENAMEX> and the
anti-abortion <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">movement</ENAMEX>, they're less likely to make totally <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Neanderthal</ENAMEX> court
appointments, etc. But even on social issues, there's more convergence than
not. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> is one of the more anti-civil<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">-libertarian presidents</ENAMEX> in modern
history. Both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> support the drug war and its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attendant police</ENAMEX>-state
apparatus--no-knock raids, forfeiture of property of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who haven't been
convicted of anything, Draconian sentences, peeing on command as a requirement
for getting or holding jobs, etc.--the latest thing is they want to inflict on
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> a genetically engineered <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fungus</ENAMEX> that's supposed to kill marijuana
<ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX>, although no one can guarantee it won't be an ecological disaster; these
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are crazy! Both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> want to censor the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX>. The don't-ask,
don't-tell approach to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gays</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">military</ENAMEX> has only encouraged sexual witch
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hunts</ENAMEX>. Then there's welfare reform, whose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> basic assumptions are that
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">endless work</TIMEX> at wages too meager to live on is morally uplifting and that
single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> are causing all of society's problems.

            The bottom line (probably not my best metaphor in this context) is the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">success</ENAMEX> of the corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elite</ENAMEX> and free-market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ideologues</ENAMEX> in pushing the "end
of history" idea--that in a post-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Communist</ENAMEX> world there is no alternative to our
present economic and social system, like it or not. This is a colossal failure
of imagination. It's true enough that it's very difficult right now to envision
what that alternative might be. I certainly have no blueprints to offer. But
there have always been <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who argued that change is impossible, or
unnecessary, or both, and they have always been wrong.

            It seems to me that this idea that what is simply is , period, is
paralyzing on a cultural as well as a political level. I didn't mean to imply
that there is really a "counterculture" now, in the sense of any conscious
collective <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">opposition</ENAMEX>. You're right, there's nothing comparable to the cultural
radicalism of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the '60s and '70s</TIMEX>. And certainly not much interest in politics--I
think most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these days</TIMEX> see politics as pretty trivial and irrelevant to
their lives. What I see in, among other things, techno, is a countercultural
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">impulse</ENAMEX>--an implicit desire for something different. (Am I sounding too much
like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greil</ENAMEX> again?) Mostly, I don't see that young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have any sense that
things can be different, so the desire stays under the surface. I think
school massacres and teen-age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> killing their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> are ultimately about
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">despair</ENAMEX> and fatalism. Keeping <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> out of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>-rated movies is not going to help.
What did you think about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbine</ENAMEX> shooting and the public reaction? I'd be
interested in your take.

            OK, onto somewhat less grim terrain. Magazines. You have to understand that
my standards for a really good <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> are still <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Esquire</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the '60s</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rolling Stone</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the '70s</TIMEX>. This is a
recipe for total frustration on the contemporary magazine front. Never mind
"favorite." What are the magazines I look forward to reading? First, I guess,
would be Commentary , believe it or not--especially the letters section.
Then <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX> --I like to read the cover essays. I like Lingua
Franca , but for whatever reason I let my subscription lapse. So I guess it
comes down to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nation</ENAMEX> , which provides much of my material for all my
arguments with the mainstream left.
