            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dear Polly</ENAMEX>,

            Though the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">series</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Britishness</ENAMEX> is vital to its charm and appeal, I'd like to
know what the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wizards</ENAMEX> beyond the shores of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Albion</ENAMEX> are up to. We do hear about
the elder <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weasley</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brothers</ENAMEX> who work in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Romania</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX>--obvious enough
magical places--but I'd love it if <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rowling</ENAMEX> could inject a bit of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tintin</ENAMEX>-style
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">globe</ENAMEX>-trotting into the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Potter</ENAMEX> saga. What if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hogwartians</ENAMEX> took a year to
study abroad in, say, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>? What are the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witches</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> like, or
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brooklyn</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Salt Lake City</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Salem</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mass.</ENAMEX>? Or are we a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> of muggles
after all? Do <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wizards</ENAMEX> play a sport superficially like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quidditch</ENAMEX>, but
with a completely different, and to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wizards</ENAMEX> utterly
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">incomprehensible</ENAMEX>, set of rules? Do they prefer <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Warlock</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cola</ENAMEX> to pumpkin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">juice</ENAMEX>,
and have their mail delivered by eagles or pterodactyls instead of owls? Or
maybe, if the stateside magic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">kingdom</ENAMEX> is too much to contemplate, the next
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defence Against Dark Arts</ENAMEX> Master (there's a new one each book, just to mix
things up) could be a voodoo priestess from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Orleans</ENAMEX> or a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wiccan</ENAMEX> from
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Northampton</ENAMEX>.

            I'd also like to know more about the political economy and social
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX> of the magic world. There seems to be a class system of
sorts--aristocrats like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Malfoys</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> end, cockneys like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hagrid</ENAMEX> and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">knightbus</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drivers</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Prisoner of Azkaban</ENAMEX> at the other, with struggling
middle-class civil-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">servant types</ENAMEX> like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Weasleys</ENAMEX> in the middle.
(<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Intellectuals</ENAMEX> like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hogwarts</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">masters</ENAMEX> are, as ever, a class unto
themselves.) But where do these distinctions come from? What is the source of
the wealth that sits in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gringotts</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX>? Is all that coveted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quidditch</ENAMEX> gear made
by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> in offshore magic sweatshops? Are they unionized? What is the
structure of wizard <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>? Who appointed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fudge</ENAMEX>? I'll stop, but
it's testimony to the fertility of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rowling</ENAMEX>'s imagination that these seem like
plausible and interesting questions, and ones I bet she'd have answers to.
Perhaps someday she'll publish a concordance to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harry Potter</ENAMEX> and explain it
all.

            Meanwhile, I don't see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harry</ENAMEX> falling for a succubus (I think that's the word
you were looking for). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hagrid</ENAMEX> might, though, what with his affection for
dangerous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">monsters</ENAMEX>. Funny that all of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hogwarts</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> seem to be
single.

            Which brings me to an intriguing point in your letter. I owe you a silver
sickle, since it seems plain to me that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homosexual</ENAMEX> themes are already
there, and treated with the sublimation and symbolism you predict. Well, not
homosexual themes per se, since whatever sexuality there is in the books is
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conventionally</ENAMEX> and safely infantile. What I mean is that being a wizard is very
much like being gay: You grow up in a hostile world governed by codes and norms
that seem nonsensical to you, and you discover at a certain age that there are
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> like you--what's more, there's a whole subculture with its own codes and
norms right alongside the straight (muggle) <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>, yet strangely invisible to it.
In out-of-the-way spots in the middle of large <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> are secret places--bars,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bookshops</ENAMEX>--that cater to this special <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clientele</ENAMEX>, and suddenly, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX>, you
find your way to them. The reaction of many straights (muggles) is hostility
and denial, on the order of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dursleys</ENAMEX>. But some muggle <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>, like
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hermione's</ENAMEX>, love their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wizard children</ENAMEX> and support them. (Hermione reciprocates
by taking a course at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hogwarts</ENAMEX> in muggle studies, the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one moment</TIMEX> in the series
that made me laugh out loud.) Consider too that there are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wizards</ENAMEX> born of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">muggles</ENAMEX> and muggles born of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wizards</ENAMEX>, so that having magical power (like being
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gay</ENAMEX>, at least according to some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> of thought) is, while not hereditary,
clearly innate. Your use of the phrase "a place for us" was especially
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">suggestive</ENAMEX> (though by "us" you meant the muggles), since that's the title of a
fascinating book by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">D.A. Miller</ENAMEX> (published <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard</ENAMEX>) about the role
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Broadway</ENAMEX> musical in forming, at once in secret and out in plain view,
modern gay male cultural identity. The process of acculturation he describes
(which involves playing the cast album from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Gypsy</ENAMEX> in your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>'
suburban <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">basement</ENAMEX>), is not unlike what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harry</ENAMEX> undergoes in the early chapters of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sorcerer</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stone</ENAMEX> .

            Is this completely crazy? I won't be offended if you say yes. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Will Jerry</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Falwell</ENAMEX> now take out after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harry Potter</ENAMEX>, having raised the alarm about Tinky
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Winky</ENAMEX>? Our dear <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleague</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chatterbox</ENAMEX>, that estimable muggle, thinks he might,
but for other reasons, namely that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Potter</ENAMEX> books take a benign view of
paganism, magic, witchcraft, and other things that scare <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Christian</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fundamentalists</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A few years ago</TIMEX> they went after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barney</ENAMEX> because he could fly,
and because he taught <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> about the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">powers</ENAMEX> of the imagination (in their
crusade they had the tacit support of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> across <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>, who are fully
prepared to believe that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">purple dinosaur</ENAMEX> is the instrument of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Satan</ENAMEX>). There
have also been outcries raised about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dungeons</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dragons</ENAMEX>, and about the mere
use of the word "imagination" in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> textbooks. So I'm sure it's only a
matter of time before school <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> start getting calls from concerned
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> complaining about our dear <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harry</ENAMEX>. Which makes me like him all the more,
of course.

            That's it! On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">their year</TIMEX> abroad in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harry</ENAMEX> and his pals
fall afoul of the local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Christian Coalition</ENAMEX>-dominated school <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> in a small
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kansas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> where they've come in search of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dumbledore</ENAMEX>'s old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Wonderful Wizard of Oz</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Minerva MacGonagall</ENAMEX> goes head to head with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pat</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robertson</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Nightline</ENAMEX> . What do you think?

            Best,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tony</ENAMEX>
