               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA Today</ENAMEX>
leads with a preliminary, non-public congressional study concluding that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX>
out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> background checks conducted by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> with access
to classified information fail to meet federal standards. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los Angeles Times</ENAMEX> goes with a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX> report that prison growth slowed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX>--finally
responding to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a 5-year-old</TIMEX> drop in the crime rate. For the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> time in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>, the New York
Times leads with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dagestan</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generals</ENAMEX> are claiming victory
against the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chechen Islamic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commandos</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX>, but independent military
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> are skeptical. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Wall Street</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal</ENAMEX> also puts this story high in its "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Worldwide</ENAMEX>" box.) The
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>
Post leads with an <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iowa</ENAMEX> straw poll roundup. (For more on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iowa</ENAMEX>
straw poll, read <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</TIMEX>'s " 
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pundit Central</ENAMEX>.")

            Conducted by the congressional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Accounting Office</ENAMEX>, a preliminary
investigation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">531</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> security checks claims that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">92 percent</NUMEX> are
incomplete, and that in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12 percent</NUMEX> of cases the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense Department</ENAMEX> failed to
follow leads pointing to financial problems, criminal histories, and alcohol
and drug abuse. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAT</ENAMEX> article says that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> grants 130,000
top-secret clearances <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> and has a backlog of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">600,000</NUMEX> cleared employees
whose files need review. The leaked report--which will be finalized in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX>--says the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> has "created risks to national security."

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> reports that despite the slowdown in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prison</ENAMEX> growth,
mandatory sentencing rules, "<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-strikes" laws, and a growing number of
parole violators have kept the growth rate from dropping as much as it might
have. (This growth in parole violations is the focus of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAT</ENAMEX>'s story,
which gets a front-page reefer.) <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last year</TIMEX>'s growth rate, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.8 percent</NUMEX>, was
considerably <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">less than the decade</TIMEX> average of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6.7 percent</NUMEX>. But the prison
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">population</ENAMEX> has now swelled to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a record 1.3 million</NUMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s dropping
crime rates mask trends such as the increased average prison stay (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22 months</TIMEX> in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990 to 27 months</TIMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>, the most recent figure available).

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> runs a fascinating feature on the informational firewalls
placed between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> investigating <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> terrorism plots--similar to those
used in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> during its <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Cold War</ENAMEX> espionage investigations. The bureau
divides its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> into "clean" and "dirty" <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX>; the former collects criminal
evidence, the latter, intelligence. The dirty <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> has an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> filter what
is illegal or too classified for the "clean" <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecutors</ENAMEX> to know. For example,
in its investigation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Osama Bin Laden</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> received information from the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pakistani</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> about a confession by one of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Laden</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">associates</ENAMEX>. In
the course of obtaining their confession, however, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pakistani</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX>
allegedly starved this co-conspirator and threatened his pregnant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>.
Knowledge of this confession was relayed from the dirty to the clean <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX>,
which then used the tip to help it extract its own, legal confession.

            Obviously taking her lead from 
                  Slate
               --see
"<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Culturebox</ENAMEX>," <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">"I Want My Electronic</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Baby Sitter</ENAMEX>!"--a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> op-ed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> uses the recent anti-TV report
by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Academy of Pediatrics</ENAMEX> as a springboard to sing her praises to
that ultimate babysitter--the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> with the blue glow: "I fondly imagined my
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> glazed-eyed, slack-jawed--and quiet. I was even willing to throw in a bag
of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">potato chips</ENAMEX>--anything to buy myself some uninterrupted <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> to unpack, go
through mail, do laundry, maybe finish that book I'd started on what we now
could only euphemistically call vacation."

            
               Did They Cover to the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Same Event</ENAMEX>? The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX>
dismiss the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iowa</ENAMEX> straw poll a "test of how many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> could
persuade to take <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">an all-expenses-paid day</TIMEX> off to be bused to a kind of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">carnival</ENAMEX>." The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal</ENAMEX> , however, waxes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whitmanesque</ENAMEX> about the
fund-raiser: "Nearly <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iowans</ENAMEX> turned out to vote. ... We'll take this
exhibition in grass-roots democracy over most of our other modern, much more
synthetic political rituals."
