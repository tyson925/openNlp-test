            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX>
leads with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> saber rattling against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chechnya</ENAMEX>, a story run inside by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> . The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">WP</ENAMEX> leads with the widening of a probe into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Embassy</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colombia</ENAMEX>, who are suspected of smuggling <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">embassy</ENAMEX>'s mail system. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los Angeles Times</ENAMEX> , continuing its extensive follow-up
on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX>'s shooting at a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">day-care center</ENAMEX>, leads with an interview of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAPD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX>, who says that all assault <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">rifles</ENAMEX> and some types of handguns
should be banned nationwide, collected, and destroyed.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prime Minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vladimir Putin</ENAMEX> threatened to launch airstrikes
against the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Islamic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chechnya</ENAMEX>, which he accuses of supporting the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week-old</TIMEX> invasion of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dagestan</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chechen Islamic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commandos</ENAMEX>. In a tactful
demurral, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chechen</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> denied supporting the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rebels</ENAMEX> and then promised
to make invading "<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">helicopters</ENAMEX> drop from the sky like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rain</ENAMEX>." <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Putin</ENAMEX> said
that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> were advancing on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dagestan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rebels</ENAMEX> and that if necessary
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> will follow the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guerrillas</ENAMEX> into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chechnya</ENAMEX>, which in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> humiliated the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> military and gained de-facto independence. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> story--run
on Page <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A13</TIMEX>--notes that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Putin</ENAMEX> has yet to be confirmed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">parliament</ENAMEX>, and it
quotes a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> proclaiming in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moscow Times</ENAMEX> that
"<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> can blow out the lights in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> and yet has failed
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> and again to contain relatively small bands of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Chechen</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">fighters</ENAMEX> on its
territory."

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> reports that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> state corrections <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> are
reviewing the conduct of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buford Furrow</ENAMEX>'s probation <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX>, who never made
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unannounced</ENAMEX> checks of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Furrow</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX>. This despite <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Furrow</ENAMEX>'s
frequent claims that he was homicidal and suicidal, and despite a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX>'s order
that he stay away from deadly <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX>.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> also tracks how one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Furrow</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX>--the 9mm Glock
semiautomatic pistol he used to shoot a mailman--made it into his hands. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pistol</ENAMEX>, which was originally sold to a small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">police department</ENAMEX> near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tacoma</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wash.</ENAMEX>, had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Furrow</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A year ago</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Furrow</ENAMEX> sold <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of
his <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX>--the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Glock</ENAMEX> and a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Bushmaster .223</NUMEX>-caliber <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">rifle</ENAMEX> found in his <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">van</ENAMEX>--to a
pawn <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop</ENAMEX> and later bought them back. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> quotes the pawn shop
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owner</ENAMEX> saying that had the transaction taken place <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several months later</TIMEX>, he
could have used a new Brady law provision to prevent their resale. This seems
slightly reassuring, but the same <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> article reports that Furrow
had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> other handguns and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">rifles</ENAMEX> in his <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">van</ENAMEX> besides the two he sold to and
bought from the pawnshop.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> fronts an investigation into whether <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> state
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mental-health workers</ENAMEX> should have forcibly institutionalized <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Furrow</ENAMEX>.
Apparently, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Furrow's</ENAMEX> was a borderline case: He had slashed his wrists, tried to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stab workers</ENAMEX> at a mental health facility, and constantly talked about his
violent, racist fantasies; on the other hand, he had had only one run-in with
the law, had sought psychiatric care, held a degree in engineering, and had
held numerous jobs, including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing Co.</ENAMEX> Mental-health experts
quoted in the story argue that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Furrow</ENAMEX>'s case is not nearly as clear-cut as the
cases against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Capitol</ENAMEX>-building <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gunman</ENAMEX> or the recent <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York City</ENAMEX> subway
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pusher</ENAMEX>.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> fronts a story noting the rise of revisionist history
textbooks in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israeli</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>. The books do away with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX>'s patriotic,
"<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David-</ENAMEX>vs.-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goliath</ENAMEX>" myths in favor of a broader perspective. For example, the
new books say that it was <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX>, not the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, which held the military
advantage in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1948</TIMEX> war for independence, and that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Palestinians</ENAMEX> left their
land not because they smugly assumed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> would lose the war but because they
were afraid or forced out by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israeli</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX>. The books use the politically
verboten term <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Palestinian</ENAMEX> , as well as the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> word for the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1948</TIMEX> war--the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Naqba</ENAMEX> , or catastrophe.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> reports that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> at a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">uranium</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kentucky</ENAMEX>
believe that while dismantling nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missiles</ENAMEX>, radioactive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX>, lead,
aluminum, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nickel</ENAMEX> were melted into ingots and sold to the private sector.
This resulted from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a far-sighted</NUMEX> 1950s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Energy Department</ENAMEX> program to recycle
scrap <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">metal</ENAMEX> from nuclear weapons <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> into forms that could be used in
household products, jewelry, and even <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>'s braces. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Guys</ENAMEX>, better bring a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Geiger</ENAMEX> counter along when you buy that engagement ring for your sweetie.
