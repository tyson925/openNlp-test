            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dear Joe</ENAMEX>,

            How nice that you are sitting in an idyllic <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New England</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, away from the
deadening lighting of a typical office. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of my favorite <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Allen</ENAMEX>, noted once that modern <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> were
"different in the ways that make no difference and the same in the ways that
do." As I sit here under fluorescent lights in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bureau</ENAMEX>--no view even of the bay!--I am wishing for any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amtrak</ENAMEX>
train.

            I did indeed write my last posting <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">late at night</TIMEX>, but remember I am three
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> behind you. So <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2:30 a.m.</TIMEX> is pretty respectable for a workaholic. Before
you decry the faster lifestyle of us all, I will add that I have been a night
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">owl</ENAMEX> since I was a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">wee lass</ENAMEX> and this is nothing different. On the topic of these
blurred times, I just read an interesting review of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Gleick</ENAMEX>'s new book,
Faster , in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">review</ENAMEX> was not a good one, but
I was heartened to hear that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>--an early Web pundit and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">entrepreneur</ENAMEX>--was arguing that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> have liked speed since the beginning of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>. I often wonder if I can keep up the pace I have set for my life, but I
have to admit, I kind of like it.

            Which is probably why I am such an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">optimist</ENAMEX> about this Internet phenom and
you are more circumspect. I caught the bug early from covering <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early days</TIMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AOL</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> and it has never left me. I wish I could
tell you the feeling I got when I <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> met with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AOL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> in their
less-than-impressive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> behind a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">dealership</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vienna</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX>. The
feeling of speed and change and something different was palpable. So was the
feeling of imminent crisis, of being on the edge of disaster constantly. This
was a group of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that had been born into near-bankruptcy and lived its
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">formative years</TIMEX> in a near-constant state of chaos.

            That's why I often discount all the stories that predict <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AOL</ENAMEX>'s downfall. It
has almost been comical at times, but they have endured everything from lack of
funding to questionable accounting to technological glitches to attacks from
some of the biggest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> out there. All of these challenges, it was widely
predicted each time, were going to surely put <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AOL</ENAMEX> out of business. They're
still standing, as far as I can tell.

            So, the free access trend seems to me to be another assault at the gates of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Case</ENAMEX> that will probably not kill them. In fact, I would go as far as to
say that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve</ENAMEX> will take the problem and turn it into an advantage. I think
although <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subscriber</ENAMEX> fees now represent the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">lion</ENAMEX>'s share of revenues for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AOL</ENAMEX>,
that they will eventually make the service free and make money off the giant
audience via advertising and commerce fees. I remember a long time ago that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve</ENAMEX> said this would happen and I think the only question is if the company
can finesse a soft landing that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Netscape</ENAMEX> did not. When you note that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AOL</ENAMEX> will
not give away free what it used to charge for, I would point out that it used
to make a lot of money from <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hourly</TIMEX> charges (some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> spent <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">hundreds of</NUMEX>
dollars on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">service</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a month</TIMEX>) and it managed to wean itself away from that
model quickly.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AOL</ENAMEX> once told me that being a fast <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">follower</ENAMEX> is the best
position to be in and that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AOL</ENAMEX> tends to move to whatever trend seems to be
taking over. They moved from an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX> to Windows <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> in their early days
without a blink; they moved from a gated service to one where the Web was
nearly co-opted into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AOL</ENAMEX>; they went from <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hourly</TIMEX> to unlimited without a look
back--this is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> that is not tethered to anything except that which
works. So if free Internet access is the plat du jour, you can be sure the
brainiacs at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AOL</ENAMEX> are noodling this one right now. I know of few other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">companies</ENAMEX>
that can change as quickly, and it has always been <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AOL</ENAMEX>'s greatest strength.

            Like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andy Serwer</ENAMEX>--also an old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> from graduate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>, where he also
dated my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">roommate</ENAMEX>--I think free Internet access makes a lot of sense. As you
surely know from our stellar stories in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WSJ</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> has been
making a lot of noises in this direction of late and those strategies are
clearly aimed at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AOL</ENAMEX>. But in the match-up between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AOL</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>--at least
in the online space--the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">giant</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Redmond</ENAMEX> has proved time and again to be the
decidedly weaker <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">player</ENAMEX>.

            And, this brings me to your last query, the nature of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AOL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">execs</ENAMEX>. In my
book, I dubbed the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> there--most of whom are the same ones from the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>'s earliest <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>--"the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cockroaches</ENAMEX> of cyberspace." I think that says a
lot. This is a resilient and deeply cynical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX>, who has been around the block
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more</NUMEX> times than I can count. They are like a giant dysfunctional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> that
looks like it is going to blow apart at any moment--this always tricks
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rivals</ENAMEX>--who then go into the back <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> and come out as one solid <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX>.

            That is due, in large part, to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personality</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Case</ENAMEX>, who is indeed
a smart and clever <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> and someone I would not often bet against. This is a man
who was told on a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> basis that he was an idiot and he kept going anyway.
His hard shell, in fact, was one of the problems I had when writing my book.
How do you make a main <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> of a cipher? I think the most important thing
you can say about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve</ENAMEX> is that he does not care what anyone thinks of him.

            Which brings us to the colorful <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Colburn</ENAMEX>. He is simply <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AOL</ENAMEX>'s bad <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX>,
and it has worked thus far for them. He apparently often tells the joke that he
had better make his money at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AOL</ENAMEX>, because after he leaves, no one will ever
hire him because he has been so obnoxious for so long. You might imagine I
loved covering him.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Cheers,</ENAMEX>
