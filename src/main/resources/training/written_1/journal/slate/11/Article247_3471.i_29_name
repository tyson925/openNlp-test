            Normally, when one of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">players</ENAMEX> in an industry buys one of its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">competitors</ENAMEX>, you hear rumblings about possible antitrust violations and the
deleterious effects of lack of competition. But we've yet to hear any such
rumblings--except perhaps from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">advertisers</ENAMEX>--about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cond√© Nast</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$650 million</NUMEX>
acquisition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fairchild Publications</ENAMEX>, even though <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cond√© Nast</ENAMEX> will now own
every key fashion <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>, with the exceptions of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harper</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bazaar</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Elle</ENAMEX> . And that's as it should be. If anything, increasing
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cond√© Nast</ENAMEX>'s hold on the fashion <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">press</ENAMEX> may have beneficial spillover effects
that no one is really anticipating.

            To begin with, even though after the deal closes, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cond√© Nast</ENAMEX> will own
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wd</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Women's Wear Daily</ENAMEX> , in addition to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vogue</ENAMEX> and
Glamour and assorted other fashion-y <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazines</ENAMEX>, it won't have a monopoly
position. And as the example of the auto industry suggests, having <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two or three</NUMEX>
major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">players</ENAMEX> in an industry is qualitatively different from having <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">just one</NUMEX>.
As long as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harper</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bazaar</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Elle</ENAMEX> remain outside the fold,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cond√© Nast</ENAMEX> will be limited in its ability to do whatever bad things monopolists
generally do.

            Actually, that's the other thing. It's hard to figure out what the bad
things <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cond√© Nast</ENAMEX> might do are, and it's just as hard to figure out who is hurt
by this deal (hard to figure out who's being hurt that we don't want to be
hurt, that is). The pricing of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazines</ENAMEX> is difficult to decipher (it often, in
fact, seems irrational), but it's unlikely that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX>'s cover price is going
to rise just because it's owned by the same <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> that owns <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vogue</ENAMEX> . And
this is despite magazine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX>' tendency to be somewhat price-insensitive,
which accounts for the fact that so many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazines</ENAMEX> are sold at the newsstand,
even though the price of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> copy there is often equal to the price of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> or
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> copies bought by subscription. So, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> won't be hurt in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pocketbook</ENAMEX>.

            As for editorial, it's possible that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cond√© Nast</ENAMEX> mentality--whatever that
is--will come to rule the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fairchild</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazines</ENAMEX>, but if a year from now you're
able to tell the difference between the pre- and post-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cond√© Nast W's</ENAMEX>,
God bless you. That doesn't mean, of course, that it won't be a new experience
for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jane</ENAMEX> to work with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Truman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Si</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Newhouse</ENAMEX>, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> don't count as a valid <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">constituency</ENAMEX> to protest antitrust
violations.

            The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> that probably will be hurt by the deal is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">advertisers</ENAMEX>, but
this is a good thing. In a business sense, the deal may make all these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cond√</ENAMEX>©
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nast</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazines</ENAMEX> less beholden to any single <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">advertiser</ENAMEX>, which in turn will allow
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> to drive harder bargains. The flip side of this is that it will
make <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">advertisers</ENAMEX> think harder about why they advertise and where they
advertise. In other words, the acquisition may have the unforeseen effect of
making the whole industry more businesslike.

            More important, this deal may make it easier for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazines</ENAMEX>--of all sorts--to
take more critical looks at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personalities</ENAMEX> in the fashion
industry. It's an open secret in magazine publishing that there are some
stories that just can't be done, because running them would result in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">advertising</ENAMEX>'s being pulled that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazines</ENAMEX> can't afford to be pulled. But now
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cond√© Nast</ENAMEX> will be in the position of saying to displeased <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> of tough
pieces: "You want to pull your advertising? Fine. If you think you can make it
without W , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Women's Wear Daily</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vogue</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glamour</ENAMEX> ,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">etc.</ENAMEX>, etc., more power to you." Shifting the balance of power away from
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">advertisers</ENAMEX> is, in that sense, entirely a good thing. So, to take a purely
hypothetical example, perhaps we might actually see a serious piece on what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ron</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Perelman</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Revlon</ENAMEX>, has done to many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marvel</ENAMEX>
Entertainment, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Coleman</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Consolidated Cigar</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Revlon</ENAMEX> itself) he's been in charge
of. OK, probably not. But isn't it pretty to think so?
