            When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buford O. Furrow Jr.</ENAMEX> confessed to shooting several <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, he
reportedly told law-enforcement <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> that he wanted to send "a wake up
call to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> to kill <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX>." He has been charged with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> "hate crimes,"
which makes him eligible for the death penalty under <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> law. What is a
hate crime?

            Like many legal terms, "hate crime" does not mean what it seems to. If you
kill your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother-in-law</ENAMEX> because you hate her, that is not a hate crime. Hate
crimes are crimes motivated by racial, religious, gender, or other prejudice.
Hate crime laws generally impose tougher punishments when crimes such as rape,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">arson</ENAMEX>, assault, intimidation, and damage of property are motivated by bias.
Forty-one <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">District of Columbia</ENAMEX> have hate crime laws. The
definition of a hate crime varies. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twenty-one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> include mental and
physical disability in their lists. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twenty-two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> include sexual
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">orientation</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">District of Columbia</ENAMEX> impose tougher penalties
for crimes based on political affiliation.

            Some <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> require that bias-motivation be a substantial factor in a crime;
others require it to be the sole factor. The federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hate Crimes Sentence</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Enhancement Act of 1994</ENAMEX> increases maximum sentences for crimes committed
because the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victim</ENAMEX> was engaged in activities such as attending public school.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> made it a federal crime to burn a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> of worship. If passed,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 1999</ENAMEX> would increase the federal role in
prosecuting hate crimes.

            Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX> believe hate crime laws are unwise or even unconstitutional.
They argue that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">criminals</ENAMEX> should be punished for their crimes, not for their
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">motives</ENAMEX>, and that making a particular belief--even a repugnant one--a factor in
sentencing violates the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">First Amendment</ENAMEX>. But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> unanimously
rejected this argument in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>.
