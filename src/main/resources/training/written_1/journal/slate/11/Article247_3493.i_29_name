            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dear Kara</ENAMEX>,

            I know what that feeling is like--that feeling that you're in on the ground
floor of something really new and different and exciting. I know how jazzed you
can get as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX>. For me, that moment took place in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1982</TIMEX>, shortly after I
moved to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>, when I was invited by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">T. Boone Pickens</ENAMEX> (does anyone remember
him?) to watch him try to take over an oil <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> times the size of his
own. I had never written a business story in my life. I barely knew a stock
from a bond. But for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three weeks</TIMEX> that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> I moved into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Waldorf Astoria</ENAMEX>
and--much to the chagrin of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisors</ENAMEX>--watched <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boone</ENAMEX> has he made
his play for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cities Service</ENAMEX>.

            It was the dawn of the age of takeovers; nobody had ever even heard of, say,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Milken</ENAMEX> back then. The size of deals were puny compared with what would
later come. And, of course, takeovers were much more problematic as a social
phenomenon than the Internet. But there was something about it that was sooooo
compelling--there was so much drama, the stakes were so high, there were so
many incredible ups-and-downs--that I was hooked. Hooked on this story, yes,
but more than that, hooked on business as a subject to write about. Those were
the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> when you got the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX> beat after you'd been demoted from the obit
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">page</ENAMEX> (I'm exaggerating, but not by much), and I felt as though I'd been let in
on this wonderful secret: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Business</ENAMEX> was exciting! Business was dramatic!
Business stories were less about balance sheets than about egos and and pride
and failures and triumphs and all the other things that are the grist of good
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">non-fiction</ENAMEX> writing. Right around this same time, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norm Pearlstine</ENAMEX> took over at
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">the Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> and began emphasizing the drama of business, and
everything began to change.

            So I've been doing this now for (gulp!) <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17 years</TIMEX>, and while I've never had
another story that gave me quite that same jolt, I've never stopped feeling
that way about business. The secret's long out now--not only because of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal</ENAMEX> , but even more because of the rise of the great technology
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who built them (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gates</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jobs et</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al.</ENAMEX>) They fueled the
popular imagination. Now everyone understands how exciting this is. And the
Internet industry has only ratcheted up the excitement all the more.

            The weird part about it all is that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who build these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> are
almost never exciting as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personalities</ENAMEX>. (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boone</ENAMEX>, God bless him, was the great
exception.) In fact, I'd go so far as to say that the same qualities that drive
them to build empires make them lousy to write about. They usually lack
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">introspection</ENAMEX>. They don't want to recount the past, because they're looking
forward. They keep their cards hidden as much as possible. I'm not surprised
that you say <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Case</ENAMEX> is a cipher. From where I'm sitting, they're all pretty
much ciphers. That's what makes this kind of journalism challenging--you're too
often writing about boring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> doing really interesting things.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Dell</ENAMEX>, anyone?
