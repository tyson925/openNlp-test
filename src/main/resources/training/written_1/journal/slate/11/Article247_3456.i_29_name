            Events in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Turkey</ENAMEX> again capture front page headlines, but only <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA Today</ENAMEX> leads with it.
The official <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> count nearly doubled in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the last 24 hours</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7,000</NUMEX>, and
conditions for the living have begun to deteriorate rapidly--no electricity,
little <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> leads with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gov.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George W. Bush</ENAMEX>'s response
to questions about his rumored <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> use. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> admitted to youthful mistakes but
indicated that he has been drug-free for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least 25 years</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> leads with
a mass demonstration in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Belgrade</ENAMEX> calling for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Slobodan Milosevic</ENAMEX>'s prompt
resignation. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Angeles Times</ENAMEX> goes with a local story on a national issue: The state
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assembly</ENAMEX> approved a ban on "unsafe" handguns, making <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> the second
state to do so (after <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Massachusetts</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX> are considered unsafe if they do
not meet standards designed to prevent misfiring.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yugoslavia</ENAMEX>'s fragmented <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">opposition</ENAMEX> pulled together for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an evening</TIMEX> of
anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milosevic</ENAMEX> fervor before, er, a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">demonstrators</ENAMEX>--<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 50,000</NUMEX> in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100,000</NUMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> , and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">150,000</NUMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> .
Neither bomb threats nor the isolated explosion of a tear-gas grenade early on
could scare them away.  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Speakers</ENAMEX> called for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>'s swift exit but
disagreed on how best to approach it. After swearing he wouldn't show up, Vik
Draskovic, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> of the largest opposition <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX>, matched the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>'s
suggestion for elections in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November</TIMEX> and was booed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX>: The
opposition's bickering and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milosevic</ENAMEX>'s control of the media and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> would
benefit the latter in the elections. The WP fronts the story, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> reefers it with an above-the-fold picture.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gov.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George W. Bush</ENAMEX> suggested that he would easily have passed strict
government background checks into <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> use at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">any time</TIMEX> during <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s or his
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administrations</ENAMEX>. Checks under the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sr.</ENAMEX>) administration reached
back <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15 years</TIMEX>, and that was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten years ago</TIMEX> at the earliest. So, simple
arithmetic yields that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> has not used <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least 25 years</TIMEX>. The
comments came after a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalist</ENAMEX>'s inquiry into whether or not <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> could pass
a background check that might be given to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> , which also fronts the story, writes that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>'s comments sparked
curiosity into his activities as a young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult</ENAMEX> and debate over the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">press</ENAMEX>'
interest in probing such issues.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">USAT</ENAMEX> leads with conditions in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Turkey</ENAMEX> for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time. The story
cites a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.N.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> who said that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to 35,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> may be
buried in the rubble. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> carries this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">figure</ENAMEX> as well but
attributes it to an official government estimate made after flights over the 
region. Unburied <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> pose great risks to public health as a source of
<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX> report. The fire at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Turkey</ENAMEX>'s largest <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">refinery</ENAMEX>, which
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> led with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX>, was brought under control after fire
fighting <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planes</ENAMEX> dumped <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">75 tons</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemicals</ENAMEX> on it.  Insult to injury: The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> reports that in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golcuk</ENAMEX> relief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> now outnumber <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX>. They
brought with them more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bread</ENAMEX> and water than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locals</ENAMEX> could consume, but no
portable toilets, tents, or generators. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> opened a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">criminal</ENAMEX> investigation into <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contractors</ENAMEX> who built the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment complexes</ENAMEX> that
crumbled so quickly and thoroughly on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX>, according to a LAT
front-pager.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Evangelical Lutheran Church</ENAMEX> voted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> to unite with the Episcopal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Church</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</TIMEX> after dismissing a similar measure. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX> will
recognize each other's membership rolls and sacraments, and work together on
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">missionary</ENAMEX> and social programs. The pact will have great resonance abroad, as
related <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX> also start to bridge gaps in practices
and programs. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Episcopal Church</ENAMEX> is expected to approve the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">union</ENAMEX> at its
convention in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> says in its headline that both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> have
been losing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> emphasizes cost-cutting needs: The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">churches</ENAMEX> can now combine resources and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clergy</ENAMEX> in cash-strapped areas. Together,
they have a combined membership of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about 8 million</NUMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> , and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> all front the story.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX> announced a possible merger that would create the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">world</ENAMEX>'s largest financial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX>, worth <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1.26 trillion</NUMEX>. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deutsche Bank AG</ENAMEX>
holds the current title, weighing in at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$868 billion</NUMEX>.) The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WSJ</ENAMEX> carries
predictions that smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">competitors</ENAMEX> will lock <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX> as well, thereby reducing
the industry's dead weight. 

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> prints <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> corrections and a short news item to clear up a
story and editorial from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier in the week</TIMEX>. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>'s lead
story suggested that <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1 billion</NUMEX> in foreign aid had been stolen in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bosnia</ENAMEX>. As it
turns out, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$20 million</NUMEX> of that sum is foreign aid, the rest was taken from
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bosnian</ENAMEX> public funds or resulted from failed tax collection. At a press
conference on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> said the story was
misleading.

            
               History textbook or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s front page?:  "The revolt of the serfs
has sparked a backlash by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">landlords</ENAMEX>, who are moving to crush the rebellion
before it gets out of hand."  Both. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Column One</ENAMEX>" article reports
that the drive for freedom is rattling the world's largest remaining holdout of
feudal serfdom.  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">slave laborers</ENAMEX> in southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> are rising up
against <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">landlords</ENAMEX> who have shackled and sold them for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>.
