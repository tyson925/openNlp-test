            If you want to know why so many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> come to stock picking with a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trader</ENAMEX>'s, rather than an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX>'s, mentality, one reason is that Wall Street
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> so often seem governed by the very same mentality. Take <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</TIMEX>'s
raft of upgrades and bullish comments on some Internet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bellwethers</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX>
at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX> ranging from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill Lynch</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paine Webber</ENAMEX>. The bullishness was framed
in terms of the long-range potential of these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>. But the fact that the
comments came out <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</TIMEX>, after these stocks had already rallied strongly
from their recent lows, was telling. Instead of making a real contrarian call,
telling their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> that these stocks were excellent buys no matter what the
market was saying in the short-term, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> were just bandwagoning.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Blodget</ENAMEX>, for instance, issued a report <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> in which he
raised his rating on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amazon.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yahoo</ENAMEX> to "near-term buy" from "accumulate,"
and added that he also expected <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> other Net <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>--<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AOL</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barnesandnoble</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Excite@Home</ENAMEX>, eToys, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Inktomi</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lycos</ENAMEX>--to do well in
upcoming <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">quarters</TIMEX>. Now, set aside the complete foolishness of distinguishing
between "near-term buy" and "accumulate" (how, again, am I supposed to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accumulate</ENAMEX> shares if I don't buy them? and does near-term buy mean that these
stocks are a long-term sell? or perhaps just a long-term accumulate?). What was
really interesting was the reasoning behind <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blodget</ENAMEX>'s call.

            "We believe [the stocks] offer a sound way to play the fundamental strength
and renewed investor enthusiasm we expect to see during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fall</TIMEX> and holiday
shopping season," he wrote, arguing in essence that places like <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Amazon</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eToys</ENAMEX> could expect to see booming business at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX>, while portals like
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yahoo</ENAMEX> would reap the benefits of all the new online <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shoppers</ENAMEX>, most of whom
would pass through a portal to get to the e-commerce sites.

            This is plausible enough. But if it was true <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX>, then it was
certainly true <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a week</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a half earlier</TIMEX>. So why didn't <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blodget</ENAMEX> issue the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">report</ENAMEX>, say, on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 10</TIMEX>, when Internet stocks were cratering and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> were
talking about a permanent end to Net mania?

            After all, nothing has changed in between to make the impact of the upcoming
fall and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">holiday shopping seasons</TIMEX> any greater. The long-term values of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amazon</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yahoo</ENAMEX>, whatever they are, have not changed, either. The only difference is
that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amazon</ENAMEX> traded at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$82</NUMEX> a share at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midday</TIMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 10</TIMEX> and closed at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$109</NUMEX> a
share on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 17, the day</TIMEX> before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blodget</ENAMEX> issued his report, while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yahoo</ENAMEX> rose
from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$116 to $138</NUMEX> in that time and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AOL</ENAMEX> jumped from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$80 to $97</NUMEX>. Perversely, the
fact that these stocks are now more expensive than they were <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a week</TIMEX> ago
makes them seem less risky to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX>.

            Does this make sense? Of course not, at least not if you believe that
eventually the price of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>'s stock reflects the discounted value of all
the future free cash flow of that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>. (Which it does.) After all, normally
you want to buy stocks when they cost less, not more. But in the world of
momentum investing, which is to say the world that all those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> who "watch
the tape" live in, buying stocks after they've risen is what makes sense. And
this same (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">il</ENAMEX>)logic informs way too much of the work of Wall Street <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX>,
even those who have an excellent sense of the economics of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> they
study. The odd thing, of course, is that you'd think that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blodget's</ENAMEX> clients
would have to be furious that he was telling them to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amazon</ENAMEX> when it was far
more expensive than it had been a week and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a half</TIMEX> before. But since his report
helped bump Net stocks up <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX>, they probably didn't even notice.
