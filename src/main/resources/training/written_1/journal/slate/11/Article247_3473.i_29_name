            News reports covering the earthquake in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Turkey</ENAMEX> have emphasized the health
dangers posed by the decomposing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> government
is digging mass graves, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clerics</ENAMEX> have suspended <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Islamic</ENAMEX> burial rules
so that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> can dispose of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">corpses</ENAMEX> more quickly. Do these bodies
endanger public health?

            The rotting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">corpses</ENAMEX> of earthquake <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> are a "negligible" threat to
public health, according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Health Organization</ENAMEX> (WHO).

            A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">corpse</ENAMEX> is only a danger to public health if the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victim</ENAMEX> died of an
<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">infectious disease</ENAMEX>. (In that case, the disease organisms can infect living
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who come in contact with the cadaver.) But when someone dies of trauma,
as most earthquake <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> did, the decomposition process is harmless, if
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">disgusting</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bacteria</ENAMEX> within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>--especially <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> from the
gut--immediately start to consume the flesh. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Maggots</ENAMEX> hatched from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX> laid in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">corpse</ENAMEX> also eat the cadaver, as can wasps, beetles, and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Larger animals</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> pick at unguarded <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">corpses</ENAMEX>.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> involved in decomposition are not dangerous, because living
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> already carry identical germs in their own <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">maggots</ENAMEX> and other
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX>, though revolting, also constitute no threat to public health. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Rats</ENAMEX> do
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host fleas</ENAMEX>, which can transmit typhus, typhoid fever, plague, and other
<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX>. But rats endanger public health wherever they mingle with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>:
They are no more harmful when they feed on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">corpses</ENAMEX> than at any other time.

            Despite ancient fears of death's "miasma," the foul odor emitted by the body
as it rots is innocuous.

            Some reports hint that unburied <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">corpses</ENAMEX> could contaminate <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Turkey</ENAMEX>'s water
supply. This is not a serious danger. In a very few cases, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> from
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">corpses</ENAMEX> can cause <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX> when they contaminate drinking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> in large
quantities. But <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Turkey</ENAMEX> is much more likely to be contaminated in other
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ways</ENAMEX>, especially ruptured sewer lines that dump <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> into <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">reservoirs</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aquifers</ENAMEX>.

            Because the public health threat from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">corpses</ENAMEX> is minimal, the WHO has even
urged <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Turkey</ENAMEX> to allocate more resources to aiding the injured and fewer to
disposing of the dead.

            Next question?
