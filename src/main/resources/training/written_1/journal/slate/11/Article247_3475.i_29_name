             As ahead of itself as the presidential campaign, fall preview season is
upon us. From now until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-September</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX>, 
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> , and half the other
magazines and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> will participate in that odd
journalistic ritual whereby <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> abandon the skepticism we demand of them
the rest of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> and emit hopeful bubbles of enthusiasm--a gush that turns
to bile when the plays or movies or art shows in question prove as
disappointing as one sort of suspected they would be.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Under-researched</ENAMEX> and perfunctory (no <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> wants this
unrewarding, time-consuming assignment), tending toward hyperbole (once a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">writer</ENAMEX> has picked things to preview, he has to justify his choices), previews
nonetheless provide a valuable service. You read the pix, you buy your tix, and
you're cocktail-party-proofed for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the season</TIMEX>. The only problem is that not
everybody goes to cocktail parties, or even longs to be up on the latest thing.
What about those of us who consume culture on the fly--who go to the movies
only when dragged to the megaplex by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>, who buy books at airport
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bookstores</ENAMEX>, who need to know whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Broadway</ENAMEX> show whose high-priced
tickets our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> are trying to pawn off on us is a gaudy spectacle from hell
or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Great Art</ENAMEX>? We don't want long lists of everything we know we should see but
never will. We want the opposite: a list of everything we must absolutely not
see, under any circumstances, if it were the only show playing in the
godforsaken <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> where we'd gone for a stint in an isolation tank and ... you
get the idea.

            To this end, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Culturebox</ENAMEX> hereby inaugurates the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Culturebox Anti-Fall-Preview:</ENAMEX>
an admittedly unscientific list of the musts-to-avoid in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this fall</TIMEX>'s cinematic,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">literary</ENAMEX>, theatrical, and sartorial <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seasons</TIMEX>. Just because it's unscientific
doesn't mean it won't be empirical: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Though Culturebox</ENAMEX> lacks a vast <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">underlings</ENAMEX> to read, watch, listen, and try on the latest size-2 fashions for
her, she will rely on you, dear <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX>, for data. Tell her what on the fall preview lists about
to inundate us you've actually read, or seen, or worked on the set of, or worn,
or gotten some serious inside dope on, and know for a fact to be a
complete and utter dud.

            For instance: This week <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Entertainment Weekly</ENAMEX> kicks off its fall preview with a two-and-a-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">quarter</NUMEX>-page spread on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kevin Costner</ENAMEX>
in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">For the Love of the Game</ENAMEX>. Having failed to win <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX>' hearts with
his last two movies, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Postman and Message in a Bottle</ENAMEX>, Costner
is presumably reverting to the most consistently successful formula of his
career: charming, over-the-hill sports <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">figure</ENAMEX> makes a comeback. Now, this may
be a masterly work of cinematic innovation--defying her own demand for
empirical evidence, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Culturebox</ENAMEX> speaks on the basis neither of a preview
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">screening</ENAMEX> nor of gossip. She just has this hunch that <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">For The Love of the</ENAMEX>
Game will turn out to be a pitch-- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bull Durham</ENAMEX> meets Tin
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cup</ENAMEX> --that mistakenly found its way to film. You make the call: "His <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX>'s
in last place. He's just found out he's about to get traded. And the love of
his life ... is about to leave him. With all of this bad news, he steps onto
the mound at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Yankee Stadium</ENAMEX>, and over the course of what turns out to be a
perfect game, he flashes back on his life and replays its pivotal moments."

            Popcorn, anyone?
