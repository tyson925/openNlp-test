            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dear Tony</ENAMEX>,

            Why these books, why now? <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boy</ENAMEX>, that's a hard one. Could be a simple matter
of demographics: <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Boomers</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> are old enough to know what they like and say
so, and there are enough of them to give their collective voice a certain
volume. Or maybe it's a cyclical thing: <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fantasy</ENAMEX> was last in fashion during the
'70s, when (as you point out) Star Wars had its astonishing apotheosis.
Is it coming back like platform shoes? Or maybe the explanation is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rowling</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">quick</ENAMEX>, enchanted pen--she's turned out <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Potter</ENAMEX> stories in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</TIMEX>,
leaving her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> no time to lose their appetites. Or could it be our
ambivalence about the recent furious surge of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">moody</ENAMEX> technology, giving us
apparently magical powers that we can't quite control? Or is someone at
Scholastic a secret marketing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genius</ENAMEX>? Or is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rowling</ENAMEX> herself a wizard? What's
your pet theory?

            I wonder whether it's true, as you claim, that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> are less likely than
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> to put up with being preached at. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>'s books on the
whole certainly don't seem to think so. <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Classics like Little Women</ENAMEX> and
The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Secret Garden</ENAMEX> preach shamelessly without losing their passionate
young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groupies</ENAMEX>, even <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Kids</ENAMEX>, after all, get plenty of lectures
("discipline," "limits") from their beloved <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>. The more recent crop of
books continue to preach, though they promote psychological health rather than
moral rectitude. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> are far worse in this respect than the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brits</ENAMEX>--even <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Konigsberg</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fitzhugh</ENAMEX>, whom I love as you do, can occasionally
sound like guidance <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counselors</ENAMEX>. Maybe one of the reasons <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rowling</ENAMEX> hit it big
with grown-ups is her refusal to drum in lessons. Instead, her books get their
depth from a combination of allegory and genuine human interactions that
haven't been pre-chewed. She lets her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> learn from their mistakes (or
fail to do so). <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Adults</ENAMEX> like that--they're can dish out the preaching, but they
can't take it.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the pleasures of reading <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rowling</ENAMEX> as a grown-up, which you touch on,
is seeing her develop as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">novelist</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> book had a simplish dramatic
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">trajectory</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harry</ENAMEX> is sure he knows who are the good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> and who are the bad
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX>, but he guesses wrong. In the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> book, I thought at first that she was
pulling the same trick, but I should have trusted her. The apparent villain
really is a villain, of sorts--but she adds surprises. As we learn more and
more clearly in each volume, there are lots of ways to help the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> of
darkness: You can join them with all your heart, but you can also succumb to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">prejudice</ENAMEX>, or self-righteousness, or some apparently silly temptation. As
Hagrid, the gruff-but-loveable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">caretaker</ENAMEX>, makes clear, you can love the wrong
kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX> (in his case, dragons and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monstrous spiders</ENAMEX>). Or you can just be
a vain goofball. In each book, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enemy</ENAMEX>'s helpers become increasingly
refined.

            The series also has some of the excitement that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dickens</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> must have
felt as they read his novels in serial form, knowing he was home working
frantically on the next installment. Publishing the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> books before she's
written the later ones, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rowling</ENAMEX> hunts out bits and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pieces</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> on and
puts them to new uses. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whomping Willow</ENAMEX>, for example, which seems like a bit
of inspired slapstick in Volume <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, has an important gesture to make in Volume
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, furthering the plot. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> tiny <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> introduced in the first book swells
to chilling proportions <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at the end of the third</TIMEX>. It's like watching Rowling
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rummage</ENAMEX> around for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> to enchant into <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX> and coachmen.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amazingly</ENAMEX>, none of it seems artificial.

            I wonder how she's going to handle the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Great</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Battle</ENAMEX> that comes with the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">genre</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Good</ENAMEX> meets Bad for something like a final showdown. So far, she's
given us small (if important) skirmishes, and sketched out a grand battle past.
The danger of series like this is that they can so easily collapse <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at the end</TIMEX>,
becoming too allegorically <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> or too morally simple. How do you think
she'll handle it?

            And do you think <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Percy</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ron Weasley</ENAMEX>'s perfect <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prefect</ENAMEX>/head <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX>/big <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX>,
will play a villainous role in one of the next books? I hope so.
