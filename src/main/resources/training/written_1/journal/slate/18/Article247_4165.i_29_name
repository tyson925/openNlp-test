            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dear Colleagues</ENAMEX>:

            Let me open with a flashback to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the '80s</TIMEX>, which is when I started writing
movie reviews and when it seemed as if all my wrap-ups began with a variation
on "This has been the suckiest year for movies in history ." We were on a
downward spiral. In the wake of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaws</ENAMEX> and Star Wars , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">studios</ENAMEX> had
been infected with blockbuster fever. Yes, they'd always been profit-oriented,
but now they were run by publicly held <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporations</ENAMEX> instead of whimsical
moguls, and development <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> had only recently become <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">umbilically</ENAMEX> attached
to marketing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">departments</ENAMEX>. We were suddenly drowning in teenpix,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Simpson</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruckheimer</ENAMEX>-style Go For It movies, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mismatched-buddy cop</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">flicks</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTV</ENAMEX> aesthetic hadn't enlarged the vocabulary of storytelling--it had dumbed
it down. The "indie" movement was but a trickle. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spike Lee</ENAMEX> hadn't emerged and,
if you believed the conventional wisdom, never would. Movies that many in my
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> regard as touchstones were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">freaks</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blue Velvet</ENAMEX> came about
because a nutty <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dino</ENAMEX> wanted <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Lynch</ENAMEX> to make another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Star</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Wars : Dune</ENAMEX> . My <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Beautiful Laundrette</ENAMEX> was financed by and for
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> TV. Really interesting "mainstream" pictures-- <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Something Wild</ENAMEX> ,
say--were seen by almost no one.

            I flash back to those dark times because I think of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this past year</TIMEX>--the last
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cinema</ENAMEX>'s first whole <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">century</TIMEX>--as the most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hopeful</ENAMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1970s</TIMEX>. It's
not that there have been so many masterpieces. It's that movies have become
expansive again. There's an anything-goes quality to even studio
pictures that suggests an impatience with old ways of telling stories--a desire
to create a new syntax to capture a new kind of flickering consciousness.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Narration</ENAMEX> has returned, along with novelistic, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">free-associational</ENAMEX> leaps in
imagery. In part, this is the upshot of digital editing technologies, which
permit noodling around as never before; and in part it's an indication that the
aforementioned "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTV</ENAMEX> aesthetic" is beginning to come of age. Thank God--and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Godard</ENAMEX>. In mainstream film, you have to go back to the silents to find imagery
this unfettered.

            I'm not talking about the undiscriminating, amphetamine-soaked pyrotechnics
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oliver Stone</ENAMEX> (or even the discriminating amphetamine-soaked pyrotechnics of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin Scorsese</ENAMEX>). It's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David O. Russell</ENAMEX> making a big-budget war movie ( Three
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kings</ENAMEX> ) that revels in both physical and moral confusion. It's Being <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malkovich</ENAMEX> , in which the fluid <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">craziness</ENAMEX> turns <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audiences</ENAMEX> on--they love not
knowing where they're going. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven Soderbergh</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Limey</ENAMEX> is one of my
favorites <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> not because I think it's such a great film (or even as much
fun as Out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sight</ENAMEX> ) but because I'm so exhilarated by its doubling and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tripling</ENAMEX> and quadrupling back. Soderbergh messes up its surface the way an
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist hacks</ENAMEX> at a canvas with an <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">X</NUMEX>-acto blade, reshuffling footage in a way
that, ultimately, dovetails with both the solution to the movie's mystery and
to its larger themes. (I'm aware of the counterexample: the dread Harmony
Korinne, whose hacking at his canvas is an attempt to disguise his limitations
as bold artistic choices.)

            Our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleague</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jonathan Rosenbaum</ENAMEX>, who shared this space <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX>, will
doubtless make fun of my sanguinity. He has argued in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicago Reader</ENAMEX>
that the most challenging foreign and independent films are not being bought by
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">distributors</ENAMEX> (or worse, they're being bought by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Miramax</ENAMEX> and left
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unreleased</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>). He might be right--I can't say. But from
where I sit, the medium looks damn healthy. Maybe former "indie" titan Miramax
is busy churning out Brit-inflected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oscar</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicles</ENAMEX>, but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner Bros.</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paramount</ENAMEX> are putting their stamp on such gutsy fare as <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Three Kings</ENAMEX> ,
Election , and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut</ENAMEX> .

            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tomorrow</TIMEX> I plan to talk about some of the amazing performances in this
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>'s movies--as well as responding to your comments and to those of our
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX>. But first, my choices for the best movies of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Park</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bigger, Longer & Uncut</ENAMEX> . This breathlessly vulgar,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hyperbolic</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Swiftian</ENAMEX> satire of the notion that movies "warp our fragile little
minds" is our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Duck Soup</ENAMEX> --not to mention the most inventive
movie musical in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX>. My only question: Why does the TV show blow chunks
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX>?

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Kings</ENAMEX> . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the most audacious war movies ever made, with
an original, off-kilter sensibility that captures the madness of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> (and the
betrayal of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Kurds</ENAMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>) in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the days</TIMEX> following the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Gulf War</ENAMEX>.
It might have been even better if it had been less bound by formula; the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer-director</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David O. Russell</ENAMEX>, is working at such a high level of
inspiration--and outrage--that the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> he has employed can't fully
contain the emotions he kicks up.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. Being <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Malkovich</ENAMEX> . Close to pure farce yet grounded in
loneliness, impotence, self-loathing, envy. The action is surreal, the emotions
are violently real. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">screenwriter</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charlie Kaufman</ENAMEX>, is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genius</ENAMEX> at finding
slapstick correlatives for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>'s nebulous sense--or non-sense--of
themselves.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. Election . See the entry above. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander Payne</ENAMEX>'s caustic comedy
tells the story of a high-school election from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> different
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">perspectives</ENAMEX>--none of them remotely rational.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iron Giant</ENAMEX> . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brad Bird</ENAMEX>'s cartoon <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">evocation</ENAMEX> of "leftist" '50s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sci-fi</ENAMEX> is uncannily lyrical: It sums up an entire era of ideological genre
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">moviemaking</ENAMEX>--and transcends it.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Boys</ENAMEX> Don't Cry . Starkly beautiful, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kimberly Peirce</ENAMEX>'s debut film
has at its core a tragicomic irony: That the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cross-dressing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brandon Teena</ENAMEX>, a k
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Teena Brandon</ENAMEX> (the rapturous <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary Swank</ENAMEX>) feels most at home among the sort
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">roughnecks</ENAMEX> who would kill her if they knew her true gender.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buena Vista Social Club</ENAMEX> . A triumphant concert that, in the
hands of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wim Wenders</ENAMEX>, is also a triumphant act of reanimation--of a
culture, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, a way of life.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Limey</ENAMEX> . See above.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Straight Story</ENAMEX> . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Lynch</ENAMEX>'s implacably untwisty road
movie--call it Found 
               Highway --with a performance by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard</ENAMEX>
Farnsworth of unbounded soul.

            10.

            I'm leaving number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> symbolically blank, because I couldn't decide among
so many terrific films. Any other year it could have been <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dogma</ENAMEX> ,
Sweet and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Lowdown , Topsy-Turvy , All About My Mother</ENAMEX> ,
Rosetta , or even (laugh all you want, you ungrateful <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">swine</ENAMEX>)
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Magnolia</ENAMEX> . It could have been <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A Map of the World</ENAMEX> , one of the most
painful movies I've ever had to sit through (I couldn't finish the novel,
either), but one that ultimately pays off. It could have been A Walk on the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moon</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">My Son the Fanatic , The End of the Affair</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dick</ENAMEX> ,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sleepy Hollow</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Run Lola Run</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Toy Story 2</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Princess</ENAMEX>
Mononoke , <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Cookie's Fortune , American</ENAMEX> 
               Movie , or the
barely-noticed black comedy <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ways</ENAMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> . It could have
been--whatever their problems-- The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Sixth Sense , American Beauty</ENAMEX> ,
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blair Witch Project</ENAMEX> (backlash schmacklash, it scared me), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sky</ENAMEX> , or The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Matrix</ENAMEX> . It could have been a poignantly silly comic-book
movie that I seem to be alone in loving<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">: Mystery Men</ENAMEX> .

            It could have been <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joel</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ethan Coen</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">The Big Lebowski</ENAMEX> , which I
inexplicably missed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> but has given me--and, I suspect, many
others--more pleasure in repeated cable viewings than all but <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two or three</NUMEX> of
the movies above. It will survive its box-office flop and become a classic.

            It could have been a movie I haven't yet seen: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tim Roth</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">The War</ENAMEX>
Zone , <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Hurricane</ENAMEX> , Any Given <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Errol Morris</ENAMEX>'s Mr.
Death .

            It could not have been anything on my Worst list:

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">20 Dates</ENAMEX> , which gives obnoxious heterosexual <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> a worse
name than we deserve.

            
               Life is <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Beautiful</ENAMEX> --the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> version. (Okay, I admit it, I didn't
actually see the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> version. I just think it's cool that I can put
this movie on my worst list <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</TIMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a row</TIMEX>. Maybe I should make it a
permanent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fixture</ENAMEX>.)

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Julien</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Donkey-Boy</ENAMEX> . See above. See anything but Julien
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Donkey-Boy</ENAMEX> .

            
               The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Haunting</ENAMEX> . The antithesis of The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blair Witch</ENAMEX> Project --and
everything that's wrong with overexplicit big-budget horror.

            
               Star <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Wars: The Phantom Menace</ENAMEX> . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jar Jar Binks</ENAMEX>. Enough said.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Body Shots</ENAMEX> . A great case for date rape.

            
               Happy <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> . How many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lame homo</ENAMEX> jokes can fit into a single
movie?

            
               Playing by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heart</ENAMEX> . Just mediocre until a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> reads Goodnight
Moon to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> on the verge of expiring from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX>. Then, monstrous.
