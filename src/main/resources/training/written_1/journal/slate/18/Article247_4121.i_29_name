            <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Tonight</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> debate in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Phoenix</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ariz.</ENAMEX>, was much, much better than
the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> that took place <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Hampshire</ENAMEX>. That debate, sponsored by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fox News</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WMUR</ENAMEX> television in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manchester</ENAMEX>, was all inside <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">baseball</ENAMEX>. The
questioners, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brit Hume</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karen Brown</ENAMEX>, asked <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain</ENAMEX> about his temper, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about</TIMEX> whether he knew how to read, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Keyes</ENAMEX> about his eccentric view that he
is the victim of media racism. This one, sponsored by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNN</ENAMEX>, featured far more
useful questions about actual issues in the campaign. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Correspondents Judy</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Woodruff</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John King</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Candy Crowley</ENAMEX> asked intelligently about education,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">economics</ENAMEX>, and foreign policy. The more varied format, which also allowed the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> to question each other, was a marked improvement as well.

            Once again, all eyes were on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">front-runner</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George W. Bush</ENAMEX>'s second
performance was consistent with his <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>. He came across as jaunty, likable,
and brimming with self-confidence. He did not blunder by confusing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Balkans</ENAMEX>
with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baltics</ENAMEX>, referring to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ruler</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Korea</ENAMEX> as "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kim</ENAMEX> somebody," or
identifying the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EITC</ENAMEX> as a baseball statistic. But if <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> didn't blow it, he
also failed to reveal any hidden depths. In the round of questions on foreign
policy, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judy Woodruff</ENAMEX> asked him my dream question, which was what he learned
from that book about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dean Acheson</ENAMEX> he mentioned he was reading. To be precise,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Woodruff</ENAMEX> asked what lessons <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> took from the successes and failures of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acheson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Marshall</ENAMEX>.

            Still failing to identify the book (which must be the recent Acheson
biography by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Chace</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> said--and this is a verbatim transcription,
checked against my tape--"The lessons learned are is that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>
must not retreat within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">our</TIMEX> borders. That we must promote the peace. In order
promote the peace we've got to have strong alliances--alliances in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>,
alliances in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Far East</ENAMEX>. In order promote the peace, I believe we ought to be
a free-trading <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>. ... The lessons of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acheson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marshall</ENAMEX> are is that our
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nation</ENAMEX>'s greatest export to the world has been, is, and always will be the
incredible freedoms we understand in the great land called <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>."

            One lesson <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> obviously did not learn from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dean Acheson</ENAMEX> is how to form a
grammatical sentence. Maybe he does better in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish</ENAMEX>, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> can barely
speak <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">W.</ENAMEX>'s most common difficultly, as in the above passage, is with
noun-verb agreement. When he gets even slightly worked up, he can't arbitrate
between his seeming need for a plural verb and his seeming need for a singular
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>. So he uses both, as in his favored expression "are is." <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> also commonly
removes the "to" from infinitives, as with "in order promote the peace." Syntax
is not his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX>.

            The way he speaks reminds me of something I once read about the linguist
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Myrna Gopnik</ENAMEX> and her work on what I believe she calls "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Family K.</ENAMEX>" Although
otherwise normally intelligent, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Family K</ENAMEX> stumble over basic grammar,
coming up with sentences like, "The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> eat <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> cookie." They have trouble
creating the plurals of words and forming verbs in the past tense--things most
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4-year-olds</TIMEX> can easily manage. I can't remember what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gopnik</ENAMEX> calls this rare and
peculiar form of aphasia, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">W.</ENAMEX> and his father both seem to suffer from a
version of it. Another possibility: The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bushes</ENAMEX> actually are "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Family</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">K.</ENAMEX>"

            The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>, and probably more significant criticism of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>'s answer is that
his comments on whatever <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Acheson</ENAMEX> book he is reading couldn't have been more
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trite</ENAMEX> and banal. They are, in fact, simply <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>'s own platitudes about the
present attached to a book he claims to be reading. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marshall</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Acheson</ENAMEX> didn't
believe that communism could be contained, or the peace kept, by a policy of
"free-trading." They argued for line-drawing and military confrontation--a
point <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John McCain</ENAMEX> made it clear he understood in a glancing reference to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acheson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Korea</ENAMEX> in his own answer to a foreign policy quesiton. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>
displayed this same callowness throughout <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the evening</TIMEX>. In other instances, such
as in his closing remarks, he simply recited familiar arias from his stump
speech.

            The other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> whose performance deserves comment is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Forbes</ENAMEX>. What
I noticed about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Forbes</ENAMEX>' performance <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">tonight</TIMEX> was that it was exactly the same as
every other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Forbes</ENAMEX> performance--thoroughly dishonest, numbingly repetitive, and
increasingly obnoxious in its gratuitous and ineffectual anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">demagoguery</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">only his second</TIMEX> campaign, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Forbes</ENAMEX> has turned into a full-fledged
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harold Stassen</ENAMEX> figure--a candidate for whom unpopularity serves as some kind of
weird inspiration. The more you wish that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Forbes</ENAMEX> would go away, the more it
provokes him to stay and waste more of your time. And with his money, he can
waste a lot of your time. 

            Some assume that because <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Forbes</ENAMEX> looks like a dork, he must have some
substance buried somewhere. Though he sounds even more canned than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>, many
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> think of him as intellectually if not morally superior for canning the
answers himself, instead of being sleep-taught by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> of former deputy
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">undersecretaries</ENAMEX>. In fact, I think <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Forbes</ENAMEX> is far less of his own <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>,
and too much of a weathervane to qualify even as a genuine ideologue. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>,
fairly new to politics, is still discovering his principles. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Forbes</ENAMEX> is already
abandoning his <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> set. Where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> has an idea of where he wants to lead the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Party</ENAMEX> (to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Forbes</ENAMEX> thinks that if he figures out where
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> is going, he can simply hop aboard and ride it. 

            It's this futile whoring after primary votes that has made <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Forbes</ENAMEX> such a
pathetic figure. After his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> debacle, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Forbes</ENAMEX> swapped his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">libertarian-tinged</ENAMEX>,
purely economic conservatism for its opposite--a preachy, self-righteous social
conservatism. He pandered to what he took to be the ascendant religious right
by saying that abortion was the most important issue to him. Amazingly enough,
many moral <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conservatives</ENAMEX> accepted his conversion. But their support hasn't
helped <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Forbes</ENAMEX>--in fact, it has made him more unelectable than ever. So without
so much as a blink of the eye, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Forbes</ENAMEX> has reversed course once again. In the
recent debates, he has left abortion and school prayer to the true believers
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Keyes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bauer</ENAMEX>, and focused exclusively on the flat tax, repeating the phrase
as a kind of meditational "om." Only this time, his fanaticism doesn't even
sound sincere.
