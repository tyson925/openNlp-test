            "Have you read the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brooklyn Museum</ENAMEX> article in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> ?" is a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">question Culturebox</ENAMEX> overheard twice at the press preview of "<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Rock Style</ENAMEX>," an
exhibition of rock 'n' roll outfits at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metropolitan Museum of Art</ENAMEX>'s Costume
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institute</ENAMEX>. The show, which opens <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX>, is the boldest display of corporate
muscle and easy museological virtue to appear at a respected <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> art
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">institution</ENAMEX> in, oh, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about two months</TIMEX>--since "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Sensation</ENAMEX>" opened at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brooklyn</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum</ENAMEX>. "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rock Style</ENAMEX>" celebrates the influence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rock</ENAMEX> on fashion, deploying to
that end an excess of media more often seen on the E! <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">channel</ENAMEX> than in public
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">museums</ENAMEX> (videos, a soundtrack, floor-to-ceiling photographs of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">musicians</ENAMEX> in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">full</TIMEX> stage regalia that cover several ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Egyptian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">frescoes</ENAMEX>). The show was
brought to you by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tommy Hilfiger</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.A.</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">quasi-official</ENAMEX> couturier to the
hip-hop generation. That means that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hilfiger</ENAMEX> funded the show, of course, and
also that he served as its "principal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designer</ENAMEX>," according to the press kit.
His name is printed in large white letters on the cover of the catalog, which
he co-wrote with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rolling Stone</ENAMEX> contributor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anthony DeCurtis</ENAMEX>.

            It was a nice coincidence that "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Rock Style"</ENAMEX> should preview <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the same day</TIMEX> that
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> laid out in sordid detail the kinds of compromises
museums make in pursuit of big-ticket shows. The article revealed that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brooklyn Museum</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arnold Lehman</ENAMEX>, granted the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owner</ENAMEX> of
"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Sensation"</ENAMEX> 's artworks, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Saatchi</ENAMEX>, an astonishing level of control over
the show's budget and layout; that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saatchi</ENAMEX> is now claiming that money seemingly
donated was actually a loan; and that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lehman</ENAMEX> probably lied to the press as well
as to potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX> about exactly how much money <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saatchi</ENAMEX> had contributed and
whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lehman</ENAMEX> had personally laid eyes on the "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Sensation</ENAMEX>" show when it was in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX>.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Met</ENAMEX> is unlikely to suffer similar embarrassment, since its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philippe de Montebello</ENAMEX>, inoculates himself against criticism by being more
openly corrupt than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lehman</ENAMEX>. Under <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Montebello</ENAMEX>, it has become standard practice
to ask interested <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> to sponsor and curate shows. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> Dior
subsidized a show of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dior</ENAMEX> couture; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tiffany</ENAMEX> paid for a show of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tiffany</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bibelots</ENAMEX>;
Fabergé underwrote a show of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Fabergé eggs</ENAMEX>, jewels, and bric-a-brac for which a
Fabergé <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultant</ENAMEX> was the guest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">curator</ENAMEX>. Next to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metropolitan</ENAMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brooklyn Museum</ENAMEX> looks like a bunch of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">amateurs</ENAMEX>. Why bicker over artistic
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> when you can just cede the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sponsor</ENAMEX>?

            The justification offered by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX> for shows that double as
highbrow advertisements is, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hey</ENAMEX>, get real, that's the only way <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX> can
afford to get expensive stuff inside its walls. "No <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>, except maybe the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Getty</ENAMEX>, has an endowment big enough to be free of the marketplace, so all other
museums have to retail products, solicit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporations</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">franchise</ENAMEX> themselves,"
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glenn Lowry</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum of Modern Art</ENAMEX>, told a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> a few
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX>. "It's up to each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX> to make sure that none of it affects
the content of the exhibitions or the integrity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>." In light of
that excuse, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Culturebox</ENAMEX> thinks the following standards should be applied to
"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Rock Style</ENAMEX>" and other shows of its ilk: Does it add value above and beyond
what you'd find in a commercial for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sponsor</ENAMEX>'s product, and does hosting it
compromise the integrity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>?

            In the case of "<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Rock Style</ENAMEX>," the answers to those questions are no and yes.
It goes without saying (though <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Culturebox</ENAMEX> will happily say it) that the show is
a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hilfiger</ENAMEX> commercial, legitimating as art the marketing strategy embraced so
successfully by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hilfiger</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past few years</TIMEX>, which mainly consists of
turning rock <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">musicians</ENAMEX> into fashion models. What's notable is that the show's
exhibition strategy is essentially the same--reducing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rockers</ENAMEX> to clothes
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX>, and without adding an iota of critical perspective.

             The thesis advanced
in "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Rock Style</ENAMEX>" is that individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rockers</ENAMEX> had a transformative effect on
fashion. The evidence lies in their stage costumes: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elvis Presley</ENAMEX>'s gold lamé
suit and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Beatles</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band outfits and</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Janis Joplin</ENAMEX>'s feathery <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ensembles</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Clinton</ENAMEX>'s outsize rabbit-and-fox
fur coat and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Bowie</ENAMEX>'s metallic clown suit and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madonna</ENAMEX>'s peach-colored
conical bras and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beck</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cream cotton Nehru getup</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tori Amos</ENAMEX>' (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tori Amos</ENAMEX>'?)
lilac jumpsuit, all looking suitably outrageous if somewhat wilted behind
glass. The whole glorious spectacle is thrilling to look at, even absent the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">performers</ENAMEX>. For the categorically minded, there is a nominal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX> of
styles: icons (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elvis</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Beatles</ENAMEX>); poets and dreamers (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Janis, the Artist</ENAMEX>
Formerly Known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prince</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce Springsteen</ENAMEX>); <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rebels</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lou Reed</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alice Cooper</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Courtney Love</ENAMEX>); and the categories of brilliant disguise (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bowie, Bono, Björk</ENAMEX>)
and high style (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cher</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madonna</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Puff Daddy</ENAMEX>).

            But fun like this we could have watching old video clips on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">VH1</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Met</ENAMEX>,
after all, is supposed to be an educational <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX>. So what do we learn
from the show about the history or sociology or even the aesthetics of rock
music or fashion? Can we say that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Janis Joplin's</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jimi Hendrix</ENAMEX>'s romantic
thrift-store <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">eclecticism</ENAMEX> created the late <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hippie</ENAMEX> look, or emerged out of it?
Ditto with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mick Jagger's</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bowie</ENAMEX>'s androgyny and the disco aesthetic of the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late 1970s</TIMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Kiss</ENAMEX>' heavy-metal goofiness and punk? What about rock itself?
How did it change once music videos made a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX>'s appearance more important
than its sound?

            There are no answers, because "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Rock Style"</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wall captions</ENAMEX> are stunningly
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fatuous</ENAMEX>. "The concept of the rock <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poet</ENAMEX>--even visionary--endures, and
many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">performers</ENAMEX> uphold the tradition in their music and dress," reads a typical
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>. (The wall commentary at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Costume Institute</ENAMEX>, which was overseen by fashion
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">historian Richard Martin</ENAMEX> until his death <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last month</TIMEX>, has not always been this
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">insipid</ENAMEX>. The bubbleheadedness in this show surely reflects <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hilfiger</ENAMEX>'s input.)
The videos, etc., are no help either. The book exhibits a modicum of historical
consciousness; it's broken up into periods, at least. But it is also stuffed
with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hilfiger</ENAMEX>'s personal reminiscences about serving as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designer</ENAMEX> to the stars,
which are as presumptuous as they are empty: "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Making clothes for Keith</ENAMEX>
[<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Richards</ENAMEX>] is easy, because he knows exactly what he wants."

            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end</TIMEX>, all we have to go on are the costumes themselves. That's plenty,
of course--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Culturebox</ENAMEX> would never discourage you from going anywhere to see
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Stipe</ENAMEX>'s gray-blue sheer organza suit, a beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">embodiment</ENAMEX> of
androgynous glamour, or the wholly deconstructed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Edwardian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">getup</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jean-Paul</ENAMEX>
Gaultier designed for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madonna</ENAMEX>, with its exuberant bursts of taffeta, twill, and
satin, as well as an over-the-top silk top hat. It's hard to keep in one's mind
just how out-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">there David Bowie</ENAMEX> once was, so it's instructive to see his black
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">quilted</ENAMEX> jumpsuit from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid 1970s</TIMEX>, the thighs of which are so exaggerated
they form a perfect vertical disc, then taper in neatly at the knees. Get the
book--which, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Culturebox</ENAMEX> forgot to mention, is very snazzily designed--and give
it to the most rock-and-fashion-conscious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teen-agers</ENAMEX> you know. Just don't
expect it to add to their ability to analyze the activity they're so
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">obsessively</ENAMEX> devoted to. Those insights will have to wait for a less synergistic
occasion.
