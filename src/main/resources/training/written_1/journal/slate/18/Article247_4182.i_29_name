            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dear David</ENAMEX>:

            Many questions. Many "methodological difficulties." How can I sort these
out? The old method, in cheder , is to tell a drusha , to tell a
story. (In my old age, I regress to the methods of my youth.)

            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1946</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Fielding Ogburn</ENAMEX>, the leading <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sociologist</ENAMEX> of social change,
wrote a sober book, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Social Effects of Aviation</ENAMEX> , in which he sought
to trace out the possible impact of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">airplanes</ENAMEX> for the remainder of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the century</TIMEX>.
He looked to see how aviation might affect our lives in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> different areas,
such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>, religion, health, environment, recreation,
crime, education, marketing, agriculture, public <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>, international
relations--you name it. Quite an exhaustive list for effects from a single
cause.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ogburn</ENAMEX> began with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, since those changes "affect almost all the
phenomena of social life," and went on to say : "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aviation</ENAMEX> will probably have
the effect of reducing the number of births slightly." One rubs one's eyes in
"slight" astonishment.

            Ogburn was reasoning from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX>'s model of the introduction of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">automobile</ENAMEX>, since "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> postponed the expense of ... rearing a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> in
order to own an automobile. ... In a similar manner some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> will be
smaller than would otherwise be because of the expense of owning and operating
an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>."

            What? What? What? (as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George III</ENAMEX> would say). Yes, at that time the
government had made that assumption. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eugene Vidal</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">undersecretary</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">commerce</ENAMEX> (and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore Vidal</ENAMEX>), had said that with the development of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">helicopters</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 710,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> (out of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">32 million</NUMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>)
would have private <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">airplanes</ENAMEX>, the reason being that these were the ones with
incomes of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $10,000</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX>. A lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> fly a private
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">plane</ENAMEX>--I do not know the number. But the initial assumption was flat wrong.

            A number of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dennis Gabor</ENAMEX> won the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Nobel Prize</ENAMEX> for inventing the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hologram</ENAMEX>. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> thought that this would "transform" our lives. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Fifteen</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX> "predicted" that we would all have picture phones in our
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">houses</ENAMEX>. What? What? What? I do not mean to jeer, but the point is that,
beginning with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Future Schlock</ENAMEX> (endorsed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Nixon</ENAMEX> and later by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Newt Gingrich</ENAMEX>), every technological change is hailed with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whiz</ENAMEX>, boom, bang,
etc.

            You use the phrase "the rate of technological change." The only trouble is
that we do not know how to measure it. Technology is a large globule of many
diverse components. Rate is a metric, but what is it? <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Economists</ENAMEX> measure
technology as part of total factor productivity, but usually as a residual
after all the other factors (capital, labor) have been measured. Not very
glamorous. And of limited use, since it does not deal with institutional and
organizational changes.

            Some technologies can be "predicted"--some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forecasters</ENAMEX> define it as
"envelope curve" projections--if you can define the narrow parameters and the
physical constraints of particular items, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moore</ENAMEX>'s Law on computer-chip
speeds and size, or more broadly, the change from a propeller drive <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> to a
jet engine--but there, the upper limits are <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">16,000 miles an hour</NUMEX>, for that is
escape velocity and you are then not in cyberspace but real outer space.

            The beginning of wisdom, I suppose, is disaggregation and particularity, and
once these have been carefully defined, to begin to generalize through
theory (which brings me back to where I began <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX>).

            On primordial identities: I don't believe in single identities, but
there are root identities such as being a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Basque</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Catalan</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kurd</ENAMEX>, or
an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Occitan</ENAMEX>, especially when there is a need to assert such a root identity
against a larger, sometimes more smothering polity or culture. But let me
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reserve</ENAMEX> that for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">another day</TIMEX>.
