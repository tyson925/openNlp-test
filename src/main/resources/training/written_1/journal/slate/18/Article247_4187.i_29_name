            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David</ENAMEX>,

            Just caught up with your postscript. In the discussion of video projection
vs. film, you ask: "What is the distinction is between hypnosis and reverie?
That sounds like mystical poetry." I <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> got turned on o this in <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Jerry</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mander</ENAMEX>'s book <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Four Arguments</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abolition of Television</ENAMEX> . To
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">simplify</ENAMEX>, he suggests that TV actually does hypnotize its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewers</ENAMEX>, while film
creates more of a dream <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. That is one reason so many of us get restless
when a film runs for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">more than two hours</TIMEX>, yet are perfectly capable of watching
the TV for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five hours</TIMEX> at a stretch. We can only take so much dreaming,
perhaps.

            My own feeling is that when a film is really working, it takes me to a
mental state that nothing on television has ever approached. Nor have I ever
felt, even on the very best video projection systems, the film experience. I am
proud of my home-theater setup. A superb Runco quadrupling projector, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DVD</ENAMEX> as
source, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">THX</ENAMEX> surround, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10-foot-</NUMEX>wide screen, etc. But film it ain't.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Digital</ENAMEX> projection, of course, is not to be confused with projected
television. It does not scan the screen but organizes the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">material</ENAMEX> into digital
"frames." Whether these frames do the same thing as frames of film is doubtful,
but <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX> has certainly not spent one dime to find out. (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> wistfully
pictures the lab <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">technicians</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Academy of Arts and Sciences</ENAMEX>, with their
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">beakers</ENAMEX> and flasks.)

            As for subjective comparisons between projected video and projected film, I
have here an e-mail from a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who asks not to be quoted by his name (which you
would recognize and respect), who points out:

            "They're digitally projecting at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2k</TIMEX> ... but also comparing against film at
2k, so that both film and digital are of equal resolution. And both are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of
the normal film resolution of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4k</TIMEX>. I would love to see them put up something
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">digital</ENAMEX> against a film image by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Freddie Young</ENAMEX>, even derived from an older
(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">grainier</NUMEX>) film stock. In short, as I see it, the test of digital vs. film is
rigged to make digital look good."

            What we have here is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX>) with unlimited resources that wants to
take film away from us and replace it with their system. And the film community
is so technically uninterested and illiterate that there is no outcry. I myself
feel keenly inadequate on this subject. I am not technically trained. But I got
into this issue and the more I find out about it, the more disturbed I
grow.

            Best,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger</ENAMEX>
