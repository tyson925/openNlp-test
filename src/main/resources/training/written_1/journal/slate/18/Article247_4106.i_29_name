            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tucker</ENAMEX>:

            Picking on Ordinary <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>, are you? You and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Brill</ENAMEX> will have a lot
to talk about in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hell</ENAMEX>.

            A question: What is an Ordinary <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX>? Are there criteria for membership
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">club</ENAMEX>? (Hasn't heard of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tina Brown</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Watches CBS</ENAMEX>. Thinks

                  Slate
                is a blackboard surface.) I ask because I'm not sure who
qualifies anymore, or what constitutes ordinary. I was on a trip to West Texas
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last month</TIMEX>, and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX>, in-laws, and I stopped in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Marfa</ENAMEX>, population
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,500</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giant</ENAMEX> was shot in and around there in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-50s</TIMEX>, and the main
drag probably doesn't look much different <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> than it did then. We were in a
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX> having lunch, the sort of time-capsule place where people
smoke freely at their tables and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vegetarians</ENAMEX> like me are out of luck. I thought
to myself: So this is the last unsullied place on earth; these are the last
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holdouts</ENAMEX> from the modern world; these are the last Ordinary <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>. And then
we heard a dusty coot in a cowboy hat in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">booth</ENAMEX> behind us talking about his
IPO.

            It is definitely true, as you say, that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> turn the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX> they
refer to as Ordinary <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> into props. I'm reminded of the time in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late '95</TIMEX>
or early <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">'96</TIMEX>, during his belly-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">flop</NUMEX> presidential bid, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phil Gramm</ENAMEX>
introduced <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Dickie Flatt</ENAMEX> to the world. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ol' Dickie</ENAMEX>, we were told, was a printer
from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexia</ENAMEX>, a tiny <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> whose previous claim to fame had been that it was
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">birthplace</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anna Nicole Smith</ENAMEX> (which itself is one for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hall of</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dubious Distinctions</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dickie</ENAMEX> worked so hard and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">such long hours</TIMEX> that his hands
were forever stained with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">printer</ENAMEX>'s ink--and if that didn't make <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dickie Flatt</ENAMEX>
and Ordinary <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> like him deserving of a massive tax cut, well,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tarnation</ENAMEX>. Dickie was indeed from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexia</ENAMEX>, but he wasn't just some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">printer</ENAMEX>; he
was a longtime <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">volunteer</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gramm</ENAMEX>'s campaigns. It's not as if he was picked out
of a rope line to play a round of Who Wants to Be a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campaign Accessory</ENAMEX>; he was
a committed partisan duped into portraying no one in particular. When
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> talk about Ordinary <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>, what they really mean is: Ordinary
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Who Already Agree With Me, Whose Life Stories and Lifestyles I've</ENAMEX>
Vetted for <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Anything Embarrassing and Untoward, and Whose Personal Misfortune</ENAMEX>
I'm <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Going To Exploit For My Own Ends Until the Election Is Over</ENAMEX>, at Which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX>
No <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">One on My Staff Will Return Their Calls</ENAMEX>.

            That <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">'96</NUMEX> race is worth recalling for another reason you mentioned: At no
other time in the history of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> politics have both <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">halves</NUMEX> of a
presidential ticket referred to themselves so frequently in the third
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dole</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Hello</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack</ENAMEX>? <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Kemp</ENAMEX>? <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Dole</ENAMEX> wants you to be his running mate.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kemp</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Kemp</ENAMEX> would be honored. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dole</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Dole</ENAMEX> thanks you. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kemp</ENAMEX>: No, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jack</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kemp</ENAMEX> thanks you. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Kemp</ENAMEX> is happy to quarterback your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dole</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arrggggh</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Dole</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Doley Bob</ENAMEX>.

            I couldn't help but work in a sports metaphor, which was the other maddening
aspect of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">'96</NUMEX>. If I had to hear <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> more football reference ... And it's no
better <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX>. The great disappointment of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX> campaign has been the
incessant use of basketball terminology by political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX>. I think it's
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lazy</ENAMEX>, empty writing at its worst, and I'm sure Ordinary <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> agree.
