            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last week</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Labor Relations Board</ENAMEX> ruled that medical interns and
residents at private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>--not <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>--and could
therefore form <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unions</ENAMEX>. What other types of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> can unionize?

            The large majority of them. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1935</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> passed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Labor</ENAMEX>
Relations Act, which gives virtually every private sector employee the right to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">unionize</ENAMEX> and bargain collectively. (This is why <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX>'s decision of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NLRB</ENAMEX>, which administers the act, affects only private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>.) Since
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1935</TIMEX>, most government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>--whether federal, state, or local--have gained
the same rights through other national or state laws. So, only those workers
specifically exempted from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NLRA</ENAMEX> are not guaranteed the ability to unionize.
(However, this does not mean that they are prohibited from
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unionizing</ENAMEX>--rather, that they cannot seek federal protection if their employer
refuses to recognize a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">union</ENAMEX>.) They include:

            

               
                  Small business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>: The definition of "small business" has not
changed since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1950s</TIMEX>. As a result, there are very few <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> that still
qualify. (For example, a wholesale <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX> would have to have annual sales below
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$50,000</NUMEX>; a retail <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX>, below <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$500,000</NUMEX>; and a law <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX>, below <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$200,000</NUMEX>.)

               
                  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Managers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supervisors</ENAMEX>: This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> includes anyone with hiring,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">firing</ENAMEX>, disciplinary, or compensatory authority over other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>. They are
viewed as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employers</ENAMEX>, not <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>.

               
                  Independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">contractors</ENAMEX>: These are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who are hired on an
individual, project-by-project basis. They are a growing segment of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">workforce</ENAMEX>, particularly in computer-related fields.

               
                  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agricultural</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>: Because they are seasonal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">laborers</ENAMEX> and have a
high turnover rate, they were excluded from the law. Only <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> has
granted them unionization privileges.

               
                  Domestic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>: This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> includes maids, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">butlers</ENAMEX>, and other
live-in household help.

            

            Although most <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> can join <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unions</ENAMEX>, a decreasing percentage are
doing so. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 13.9 percent</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workforce</ENAMEX> was unionized--down from
<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20.1 percent</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1983</TIMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first year comparable</TIMEX> statistics were collected). And
when government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> are excluded, the percentages are even lower: While
<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">37.5 percent</NUMEX> of public <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> are unionized, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 9.5 percent</NUMEX> of the private
sector is.
