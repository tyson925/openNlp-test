            Issue <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John McCain</ENAMEX>'s continuing surge in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Hampshire</ENAMEX>. Issue <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Al</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX>'s heated attacks on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Bradley</ENAMEX>.

            Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pundits</ENAMEX> think that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George W. Bush</ENAMEX>'s mediocre performance in his two
debate appearances has made him vulnerable, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pundits</ENAMEX> disagree over just how
vulnerable. On <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Meet the</ENAMEX>
Press , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Des Moines</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Register</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Yepsen</ENAMEX> predicts that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain</ENAMEX> will do well in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iowa</ENAMEX> even without campaigning there, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Bachman</ENAMEX>,
of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Des Moines</ENAMEX>' WHO-TV, says that his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">station</ENAMEX>'s recent poll shows <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain</ENAMEX> still
behind <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> points. On <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fox News</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tony Snow</ENAMEX> points out that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>'s national lead hasn't
budged--despite his trouble in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Hampshire</ENAMEX>--but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brit Hume</ENAMEX> predicts that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>'s debate performances will start a popularity slide in the early primary
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>. On <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNN</ENAMEX>'s Late
Edition , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Roberts</ENAMEX> asserts that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supporters</ENAMEX> are uneasy with
his debate performance, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Susan Page</ENAMEX> notes that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> is still the
overwhelmingly likely <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nominee</ENAMEX>.

On <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">This Week</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Kristol</ENAMEX>, ever the neoconservative, continues
to support reformist <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">underdog</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain</ENAMEX>, while <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George F. Will</ENAMEX>, ever the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Tory</ENAMEX>,
continues to argue for establishmentarian <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">front-runner</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>. Will points out
that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GOP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">establishment</ENAMEX>'s endorsement of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> was completely voluntary and
that grassroots uprisings, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain</ENAMEX> is attempting to bring about, are not
always good for the party--look at what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George McGovern</ENAMEX> did to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kristol</ENAMEX> counters that despite <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McGovern</ENAMEX>'s failure as a presidential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX>,
his empowerment of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Democratic Party</ENAMEX>'s grassroots was healthy. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kristol</ENAMEX> then
predicts that once <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> debates in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iowa</ENAMEX> tomorrow his polls will start sliding
there.

            With a few exceptions--such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark Shields</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">NewsHour With Jim Lehrer</ENAMEX> ) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Germond</ENAMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Meet</ENAMEX>
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Press</ENAMEX> )--the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pundits</ENAMEX> agree that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Bradley</ENAMEX> must respond to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Gore</ENAMEX>'s
charge that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX> would raise taxes as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Gigot</ENAMEX>
( <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">NewsHour and Meet the Press</ENAMEX> ) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tucker Carlson</ENAMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Late</ENAMEX>
Edition ) both think that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX> must fight back to stay alive. (Gigot
calls it <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX>'s "moment of truth.") <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Juan Williams</ENAMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fox</ENAMEX> ) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tucker</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carlson</ENAMEX> say that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX>'s attack-dog campaigning has reminded the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> people
that a general-election fight against the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> would be no cakewalk.
Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pundits</ENAMEX> agree that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX>'s recently disclosed heart problem is not a big
deal.

Interviews <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et</ENAMEX> cetera: The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fox</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> makes up for its
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">kid</ENAMEX>-gloves treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth Starr</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several weeks ago</TIMEX> (see the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Nov. 15</TIMEX> "Pundit
Central") by grilling <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John McCain</ENAMEX>--and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain</ENAMEX> rises to the occasion. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tony</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Snow</ENAMEX> asks <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain</ENAMEX> who his favorite <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court Justice</ENAMEX> is, and when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain</ENAMEX>
says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandra Day O'Connor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Snow</ENAMEX> asks him to name an area in which she has had a
lasting effect on constitutional law. After a short pause, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain</ENAMEX> answers:
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Native American</ENAMEX> rights. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brit Hume</ENAMEX> asks <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain</ENAMEX> about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dean Acheson</ENAMEX>'s role in
the firing of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Douglas MacArthur</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain</ENAMEX> responds that he admires <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acheson</ENAMEX>'s
involvement because the dismissal was necessary to assure civilian control of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">military</ENAMEX> at the start of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Cold War</ENAMEX>. ... While <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain</ENAMEX> is on the program,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fox</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producers</ENAMEX> flash a message on the screen asserting that, with
an IQ of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">133</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain</ENAMEX> would be "among the most intelligent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Presidents</ENAMEX> in
history."

kept me up to speed. I think the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Backstreet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Boys</ENAMEX> are her favorite, but I'm
terribly concerned--she seems enamored with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ricky Martin</ENAMEX>. I know that he's a

            The practical effect of that will be that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> , the
trial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX>, the labor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unions</ENAMEX>, and the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> shows will have all the
influence over the presidential campaign from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about March</TIMEX> [until the
election].

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>, I hear, are going to have a joint event funded by soft money
on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K Street</ENAMEX>--to contrast the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain-Bradley</ENAMEX> campaign-finance-reform
event--co-hosted by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Terry McAuliffe</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Clinton</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">fund raiser</ENAMEX>, and Haley
