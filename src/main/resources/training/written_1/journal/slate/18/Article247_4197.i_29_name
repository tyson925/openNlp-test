            Dear all,

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger</ENAMEX>, I grew up in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX>, where I read and watched you with admiration,
and your remarks <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> on reviewing etiquette gave both my admiration and
some dormant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicago</ENAMEX> chauvinism a shot in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX>. I doubt too many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> squawk and swap their opinions during or even right after a screening.
But I bet that too few them demonstrate the consideration for their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX>
that you do, or your habitual fairness.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elvis</ENAMEX>, you raised <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> really important points <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX>. The dearth of
relationship films <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> may just be a cyclical thing, I suspect.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beautifully</ENAMEX> acted but formulaic films like <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Walk on the Moon</ENAMEX> suggest we
could use a fallow period, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> to regroup and think up fresh stories
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about</NUMEX> attraction and trust. The dearth of decent roles for black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actors</ENAMEX> goes
deeper, and is much more frustrating. I'll try to see The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Green Mile</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">tonight</TIMEX> so I can join in on the debate. But I have to confess I've stayed away
so far on purpose. The preview was a turnoff, and not just because of the
innocent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">giant</ENAMEX> in cuffs. For me, the red alert was the sight of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Hanks</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gulping</ENAMEX> and tearing up. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hanks</ENAMEX> is a supremely effective <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actor</ENAMEX>, I admit, but
there are times <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these days</TIMEX> when I can barely stomach him. Wherever he goes, a
treacly, white-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> triumphalism seems to follow. He doesn't even have to be on
screen for this to happen. Did you all see the film he directed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few years</TIMEX>
back, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">That Thing You Do</ENAMEX> ? The main <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> is a teen-age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drummer</ENAMEX> in a
band that hits it big in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early '60s</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hanks</ENAMEX> clearly identifies with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX>,
and the weirdly anti-dramatic thing is this: Nothing bad happens to him
in the film. Everything he touches turns into <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diamonds</ENAMEX>; he gets to steal his
best <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girlfriend</ENAMEX> but retain the moral upper hand; everyone, even
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">strangers</ENAMEX>, watches out for his happiness. As long as I live, I won't forget the
ending, where a black bellhop with flashing eyes and a big smile and an
inappropriately loud, excitable voice takes it upon himself to fix up this
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">kid</ENAMEX>'s love life. Jeepers, what a cringer. The film is set in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">'63</TIMEX>, I guess,
before the civil-rights movement kicked into really high gear, and underneath
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">liberal</ENAMEX> veneer of many a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hanks</ENAMEX> film I sense some creepy nostalgia for this
simpler time.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hanks</ENAMEX> is a bugaboo for me--sorry if I got off track. Anyway, the point I'd
like to make to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger</ENAMEX> is that objecting to objectified <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> is not a
matter of p.c, of holding things up to a rigid ideological test. This is a
moral problem, and an aesthetic problem, and as I said above, at times for me
it is a visceral problem of not wanting to sit still for more of the old
false-humility routine. In this regard, I appreciate your praise of Three
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kings</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elvis</ENAMEX>. Yet I actually wanted much more screen time for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ice Cube</ENAMEX>.
Even by the abstract and deconstructive standards of the film he felt
underdeveloped to me, undermotivated; complicated though he was, he remained a
sidekick, his decisions less closely examined and symbolically freighted and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">intensely</ENAMEX> presented than those of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clooney</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wahlberg</ENAMEX>.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> last, semi-related thought. Again, please don't take this in the spirit
of reductive p.c.--I don't mean it that way. But don't believe the hype about
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> being on the ropes, culturally speaking. I couldn't help noticing the
unabashedly male viewpoint of many of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX>'s most interesting films. With
the exception of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Run Lola Run</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Election</ENAMEX> , with its coolly neutral,
dissecting point of view, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Boys</ENAMEX> Don't Cry , which had the fascinating
point of view of some androgyne god, I noticed a whole lot of guyness in this
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>'s movies. I found it a little disappointing that something as humane and
innovative as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Iron Giant</ENAMEX> couldn't put a tiny bit more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meat</ENAMEX>, or sass,
or something, into <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jennifer Aniston</ENAMEX>'s part. The fearless <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cameron Diaz</ENAMEX> turned
the role of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lottie</ENAMEX> in Being <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Malkovich</ENAMEX> into a miracle, but its
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">conception</ENAMEX>, and that of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Catherine Keener</ENAMEX> the emasculator, was based on a
tried-and-true and rather juvenile male fantasy (or so my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> tell me).
Toy <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Story 2 : Woody</ENAMEX>. Need I say more? There are so many more examples
(highlight: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sean Penn</ENAMEX> finding peaceful, rewarding love with a deaf
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mute</ENAMEX> ), but I'll leave you to chew it over.

            This is fun.

            Till soon,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sarah</ENAMEX>
