            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Angeles Times</ENAMEX> leads with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boris Yeltsin</ENAMEX>'s blunt reaction to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">President</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s criticism of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Chechnya</ENAMEX> operation: Don't forget that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moscow</ENAMEX>
has a vast nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">arsenal</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> flags <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeltsin</ENAMEX> at the top of its
front-page news box. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">carries Yeltsin</ENAMEX>'s remarks inside (as do the other papers), somehow leading
instead with the promise made <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> that refugees
who've flooded out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chechnya</ENAMEX> recently will be able to return to
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX>-controlled parts of the region by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the year</TIMEX>. The paper
explains this is intended to signify that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> is making progress towards
stabilizing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chechen</ENAMEX> situation. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> goes with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Army</ENAMEX>'s newest recruitment
lure: offering entry-level <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX> an array of virtually no-cost college-level
courses over the Internet leading to an associate's degree. This unprecedented
educational expansion for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">G.I.</ENAMEX>s , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> explains, is a sign of the
difficulties the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Army</ENAMEX> is having trying to compete with the booming civilian job
market. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> leads with a new outside study blaming <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> and industry
for failing to sufficiently ensure the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Y2K</NUMEX>-compliance of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s drinking
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> and sewage systems.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> calls <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeltsin</ENAMEX>'s comments, which came while he was in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> to
win support for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chechnya</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX>, an "outburst," and compares it to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nikita Kruschev</ENAMEX>'s "We will bury you." But the paper depicts both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">President</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prime Minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vladimir Putin</ENAMEX> as trying to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">de</ENAMEX>-escalate. The
other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX> agree on these points with this slight difference: The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX>
see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeltsin</ENAMEX>'s performance as "apparently calculated."

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> lead explains that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Army</ENAMEX>'s new educational initiative is
particularly well suited to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanics</ENAMEX>, who make up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40 percent</NUMEX> of those
potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recruits</ENAMEX> who show high military aptitude despite lacking a
high-school diploma, and to deployed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX>, who, it is thought, should be
able to keep up with course work via Internet-aided "distance learning" far
better than they could via traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">classroom</ENAMEX>-based coursework. A question
the story doesn't address: Why is this change only being proposed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Army</ENAMEX>?
Wouldn't it also help the other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branches</ENAMEX> with their recruitment woes?

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAT</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> front (while the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stuffs</ENAMEX>) the fascinating spy story unfolding in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>, where <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> before
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> it was announced that a career <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> intelligence <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> was sent
packing after being caught engaging in an eavesdropping <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX> against the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX>. The coverage reports that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> was, without ever
having set foot in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>, communicating with a bug that had been
professionally secreted in spaces near <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madeleine Albright</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>--the first
ever known penetration of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Foggy Bottom</ENAMEX>. It is reported that some <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>-100
sensitive meetings took place there during the bug's deployment.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYT</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> report that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> operative was caught with a device hidden in his clothing
that turned on a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">receiver</ENAMEX> and tape recorder in his <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> quotes
one "senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX>" who denies that there was a recorder involved, but also
others saying there was. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> refuse to say whether
disinformation was fed to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russians</ENAMEX> after the bug was discovered, while the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WP</ENAMEX> says this is precisely what was done.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> points out that the former <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> excelled in this sort
of high-tech bugging, and gives a nice history of the known <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> operations
of this sort undertaken against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX>. The story also quotes former
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Gates</ENAMEX> as saying that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15 years ago</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> was concerned
about the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviets</ENAMEX>' "ability to read conversations from the vibrations of window
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">panes</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>." A question about that: Presumably the window pane
technology and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> worries about it are classified. So who says private
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">citizen Gates</ENAMEX> can mouth off about it to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX> ? <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Papers</ENAMEX> guesses
that if this statement came out of the mouth of say, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel Ellsberg</ENAMEX>, handcuffs
might be involved.
