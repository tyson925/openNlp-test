            A few comments on <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">last night</TIMEX>'s debate in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iowa</ENAMEX>:

            
               <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John McCain</ENAMEX>'s guts
            

            Everyone was waiting to see how <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain</ENAMEX> would handle a question about
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ethanol</ENAMEX>, the corn-based <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fuel</ENAMEX> that exists only because of a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">multibillion-dollar</NUMEX>
federal subsidy. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain</ENAMEX> didn't wait to be asked. He took the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> opportunity
to inform <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Iowans</ENAMEX> that "I'm going to tell you the things that you don't want to
hear as well as the things you want to hear"--namely that "those ethanol
subsidies should be phased out, and everybody here on this stage, if it wasn't
for the fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iowa</ENAMEX> is the first <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">caucus state</ENAMEX>, would share my view that we
don't need ethanol subsidies. It doesn't help anybody." <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain</ENAMEX> was booed for
this answer. The others--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hatch</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bauer</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Forbes</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Keyes</ENAMEX>--were quick to
protest their fervent support for this boondoggle, which violates every known
conservative principle but draws cheers in the corn belt. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCain</ENAMEX>'s handling of
this issue, in contrast to every other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> in the race, is the definition
of political courage.

            
               <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George W. Bush</ENAMEX>'s evasiveness
            

            Given the way the expectations game works, any non-moronic answer by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>
now counts for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as much as</NUMEX> a superb answer by any of the other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>
fared well because most of his answers <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">last night</TIMEX> were successfully
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">non-moronic.</ENAMEX> But if you pay close attention, you begin to notice that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>'s
answers have a more than ordinarily tangential relationship to the questions he
is asked. Instead of engaging the premise of a question, he simply clicks on
some key word he recognizes and links to a pre-programmed response.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Brokaw</ENAMEX> asked, "Is there anything specifically that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX> can do to interrupt what seems to be an evolving culture of
violence and rage in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>?"

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> answered: "You know, one of the interesting parts of your question is
that there's so much focus on the Dow Jones industrial average <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>--and
that's fine. ... The next <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> must tap into the
great strength of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>, which are the hearts and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">souls</ENAMEX> of decent <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>."
But "the Dow Jones industrial average" wasn't part of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brokaw</ENAMEX>'s question--which
was a request for something beyond the airy platitudes about compassion that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> has been delivering.

            When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brokaw</ENAMEX> asked, "Why should the family <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">farm</ENAMEX> ... be any more protected
than the corner drugstore or the mom-and-pop shoe <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX> or the little grocery
store that we used to find on main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>?" <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> responded: "I think if you ask
the family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmer</ENAMEX>, they don't feel protected." He then gave an answer about the
need to spend money on finding more uses for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iowa</ENAMEX> corn <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">products</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> simply
ignored the challenge to his assumption that <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">farms</ENAMEX> deserve benefits not
accorded to other kinds of small businesses.

            When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brokaw</ENAMEX> asked <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> whether he would be more aggressive in enforcing
existing laws against possession of marijuana, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> said he favored
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interdiction</ENAMEX> and sending the message to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>, "Don't be usin' <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>." Once
again, he ignored the challenge to a contradiction in his views: that gun laws
should be rigidly enforced, but that certain drug laws should not be.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> isn't the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> to dodge and weave around awkward questions from
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX>. But he is more than ordinarily unresponsive. To use the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>-appropriate metaphor, he's like a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hitter</ENAMEX> facing a tough <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pitcher</ENAMEX>. Intent on
not striking out, he bats pitch after pitch into foul territory. The best
instance of this was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>'s answer to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewer</ENAMEX>'s question about what political
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">philosopher</ENAMEX> each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> identified with and why. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> had time to think this
over--he was <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> in line after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Forbes</ENAMEX>, who cited <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Locke</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jefferson</ENAMEX>, and
Keyes, who cited "the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founders</ENAMEX> of this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>." <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>'s response: "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christ</ENAMEX>,
because he changed my heart." <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> heard the word "philosopher," seized on a
related concept--"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Christ</ENAMEX>"--and simply ignored the other key <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> in the
question, like "political" and "identify with" and "why." The follow-up should
have been: "Why do you think of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christ</ENAMEX> as a political philosopher?"

            
               <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Orrin Hatch</ENAMEX>'s resentment
            

            In the last debate, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hatch</ENAMEX> gave a patronizing lecture about how the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">unseasoned Bush</ENAMEX> would make a fine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice-</ENAMEX>presidential choice for him. In the one
before that, he described <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John McCain</ENAMEX>'s anger as "a terrible thing." This time
it was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Forbes</ENAMEX> who got the back of his hand. Given a chance to ask a
question of a rival <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hatch</ENAMEX> said he would give <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Forbes</ENAMEX> a "home-run
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ball</ENAMEX>."

            "That usually means hold your wallet," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Forbes</ENAMEX> answered.

            "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve</ENAMEX>, I couldn't even lift your wallet," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hatch</ENAMEX> shot back.

            This was the wisecrack of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the night</TIMEX>. But I think it also offered a glimpse
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hatch</ENAMEX>'s dark side--an envy that makes him into a more interesting character
than I previously thought. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hatch</ENAMEX> also ribbed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brokaw</ENAMEX> on this same point. When
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brokaw</ENAMEX> asked why someone who makes as much as he does should get the same
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> benefits as an <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iowa</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">schoolteacher</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hatch</ENAMEX> went on and on: "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Well</ENAMEX>, first
of all, I don't think you're going to ask for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> with the amount of money
you make. In fact, I think you could take care of all of us right up here on
the dais with what you make--and maybe everybody in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> as well."

            Later in the debate, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hatch</ENAMEX> spoke, as he always does, of how he once raised
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">chickens</ENAMEX> and sold <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX> and worked as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">janitor</ENAMEX> and has been faithful to his
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43 years</TIMEX>. I'm starting to understand why he's running for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>:
because he sees everyone around him getting the money, fame, sex, and credit
that he so richly deserves.
