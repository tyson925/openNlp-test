            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dear Margo</ENAMEX>,

            An <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> at 
                  Slate
               --a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jew</ENAMEX>--notes that we are ideally
matched <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> because we share an obsession with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chosen People</ENAMEX>. So I am
sure you will understand my feelings of discomfort on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this third day</TIMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hanukkah</ENAMEX>.

            As originally conceived, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hanukkah</ENAMEX> was a celebration of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> to
a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> invasion. It has evolved into a test of our ability to withstand a
grease invasion. For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last few days</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> around the world have consumed an
unspeakable amount of a delicacy called latkes--<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">potato pancakes cooked</ENAMEX> in vats
of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX>. Today, I am sorry to report, this <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jew</ENAMEX> is doing a terrible job of
resisting the grease. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December</TIMEX> is already <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">an unkind month</TIMEX> for those of us with
combination skin. But on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this third day</TIMEX> of latkes, many of us awoke to find
that our faces haven't been this splotchy since our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX> mitzvahs. A little
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sympathy</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Margo</ENAMEX>) or a suggestion for a home-remedy (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudie</ENAMEX>), please ...

            I am currently en route to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Phoenix</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">tonight</TIMEX>'s debate between the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> presidential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nominees</ENAMEX>. Yes, there is a debate tonight. Yes, Massa
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George W. Bush</ENAMEX> will be there. But oddly, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John McCain</ENAMEX> won't be in his home
state. The way I understand it, he'll be piped in via <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">satellite</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hampshire</ENAMEX>. I happen to think that this is the latest in a series of shrewd
moves by the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Angry White Candidate</ENAMEX>, who graces the cover of Time
magazine <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</TIMEX>. Let <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> share the stage with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Keyes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gary Bauer</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Forbes</ENAMEX>. It can only help to diminish him. Meanwhile, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John McCain</ENAMEX> looks
above the fray in his remote <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">studio</ENAMEX>. (And if he gets a tough question, he can
always claim that technical problems have prevented him from hearing it.)

            This same <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GOPers</ENAMEX> got together <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX> and pretty much exhausted
pretty much every available topic of contention. Therefore, I predict tonight
will be especially raucous. Without anything else of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substance</ENAMEX> to talk about,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> can fill their time with the ad hominem attacks they've been
saving up. Desperate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bauer</ENAMEX> have been threatening to take the
gloves off. Before every debate, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bauer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aides</ENAMEX> promise, "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Tonight</ENAMEX>, you'll really
see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gary</ENAMEX> unplugged." I'm still waiting and hoping that he'll finally be barking
mad.

            Before we get off politics and onto more important questions--like the death
of the sitcom--what is it with drama <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Marks</ENAMEX>' piece on campaign ads
on the front page of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> ? I like the idea of having <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> write
on politics. (The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> seems to want to make it a regular feature, with
recent contributions by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caryn James</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michiko Kakutani</ENAMEX>.) And our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rich</ENAMEX> does it brilliantly. But what we like about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank</ENAMEX> is that he takes his
sharpened pencil and jabs into <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> the same way that he would a
third-rate revival. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Forbes</ENAMEX> would be as devastated as badly as
Footloose the musical. But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marks</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kakutani</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James</ENAMEX> seem to be holding
back. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> is probably afraid of launching napalm-filled lorries from the
front page. So why waste the space?

            If we wanted to talk about <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this morning</TIMEX>, there are plenty of ways to
get started. There is the burning question: Did the West <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Nile</ENAMEX> virus originate
in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX>? Then there is the intriguing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Safra</ENAMEX> murder. I would probably rather
talk about the decline of the sitcom, which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> diagnoses. It
argues the genre is worn out and will be challenged by the rise of the game
show. This strikes me as bunk. Sitcoms have been expanding exponentially over
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the '90s</TIMEX>. The wild success of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Friends</ENAMEX> , I think, kicked off the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">era</TIMEX>. But
TV is the classic "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Me Too</ENAMEX>" medium. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Success</ENAMEX> breeds infinite imitation, and
infinite imitation means loads of dreck that garners poor ratings and
cancellation. (Soon we'll be reading stories about "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The End of the Game Show</ENAMEX>.")
What we're seeing isn't the end of the genre, but a return to equilibrium.
We'll have as many sitcoms as we had in, say, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX>. And to this trend I say,
"Amen."

            If you're looking for me <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">tonight</TIMEX> on TV, I'll be the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jew</ENAMEX> with the bad
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">complexion</ENAMEX>.

            Unctuously,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Frank</ENAMEX>
