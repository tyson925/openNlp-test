            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Massa</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Honey</ENAMEX>--

            Your <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> ride sounds amazing. Were I you, I would've looked at it this
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX>: Nothing will happen to this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX>, because the news value of a crash would
be too astounding. Are you old enough to remember <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bishop Sheen</ENAMEX>? We were once on
the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>--with several nuns--and I took that to be the same kind of
indemnity ... not the religious factor, the fame. This thinking is flawed, I
know, but that's the way my mind works. Or doesn't.

            I'm holding off reading the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> today, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mini-boycott</ENAMEX>--because
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> they made <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nelson Rockefeller</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> in someone's obituary. He
wasn't, was he? If he was, I think I need to go back and read the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dean Acheson</ENAMEX>
book ...

            I love the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chappaqua</ENAMEX> carryings on. Well, make that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chappaqua</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tina Brown</ENAMEX>. Seems that the editrix declared <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hill</ENAMEX> a loser in her
intended race. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bet Hill</ENAMEX>'s sorry, now, that she gave <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tina</ENAMEX> her innermost
psychobabble for the premiere issue of Talk . As if being declared a
loser by a former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sycophant</ENAMEX> weren't bad enough, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">first lady</ENAMEX> was just
selected <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>'s "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Most Boring Celebrity</ENAMEX>" by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boring Institute</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maplewood</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NJ</ENAMEX>. Not that they're a heavy-hitter <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, but still ...

            My concerns about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chappaqua</ENAMEX>, however, are not political. They are concerns
any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> would have about moving into a new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX>. Will she be able to find her
underwear with all those boxes piled up? I know she intends to find it,
but you never know. And will she be given a good phone number--and will the
phone even work on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first day</TIMEX>? I hate to say this, because it's politically
incorrect--at least in my circles--but you gotta love <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lucianne</ENAMEX>. She (and a few
other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX>) implied that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> equivalent of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX> dick
ought to keep an eye on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hill</ENAMEX> so she doesn't try to furnish her <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> with
things from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1600</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Camp David</ENAMEX>.

            But just to show that I am not totally down on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hill</ENAMEX>, I hope that, like some
of the royals, she'll have a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fling-a-ling</ENAMEX> with one of the bodyguards. God knows
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> could use some, uh, well, whatever. What I really want is for the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clintons</ENAMEX> to just go away. Far away. And quietly. Fat chance.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">xxM</ENAMEX>.
