            In these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX>-conscious
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>, feet do get their due. Ask any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX>: Shoes matter as much as hairstyle in
all walks of life, and infinitely more than gloves and hats, despite being so
near the ground. Buying shoes demands sizable chunks of time and money, and the
eventual decision generates more existential agony about their looks than about
their fit. Pain in the feet may be negotiable, pain in the image never. Passion
or hatred can be ignited by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> glance in a shoe <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX> window. If the lust of a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">shopper</ENAMEX>'s eye is slaked by actual purchase, her willing feet accept the
challenge, her active spirit expands. The <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">other night</TIMEX>, I looked across a
restaurant at a sexy young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> who appeared to be limping. She wasn't,
though, not at all, really. She was just wearing <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5-inch spike heel, 2-inch</NUMEX>
platform sole, tight-fitting, thigh-high boots, and making her spectacular way
among the tables to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">exit</ENAMEX>.

            The current display at
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fashion Institute of Technology</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York City</ENAMEX> is called
"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Shoes: A Lexicon of Style</ENAMEX>." It focuses on the amazing range of design in
modern <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>'s shoes. There's no history here, no sociological detachment--only
the look, divided into categories for maximum impact. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Drama</ENAMEX> is increased by the
use of a single lighted showcase running the length of the pitch-dark <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> with
no interruptions, no pauses for breath. You move along in one direction,
mesmerized by a single great sweep of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shoes</ENAMEX> arranged in pairs on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> rising
tiers under vivid lights. Emotional tension mounts, laughter and wonder
alternate with lust and disgust, no relief is offered, from the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> stiletto
heel to the last bulbous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nike</ENAMEX>.

            Apart from a few historic examples, such as some satin
pumps with celluloid heels from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1928</TIMEX>, most of these styles date from the last
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three decades</TIMEX>, even from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last three years</TIMEX>. This show indicates that only in
the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last third of this century</TIMEX> have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designers</ENAMEX> really hit their stride with
varieties of shoe material, shoe shape, shoe trim, and shoe attachment.
Nevertheless, one of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">favorites</ENAMEX> here was designed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1958</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herbert Levine</ENAMEX>:
a pair of stiletto-heeled soles with no uppers at all, nothing but some
invisible adhesive pads to hold each shoe against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wearer</ENAMEX>'s bare sole. These
shoes would look as if they had grown there, by some potent fashion
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sorcery</ENAMEX>.

            Another great shoe moment
is a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX> pair of "tabi toe" ankle boots by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin Margiela</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX>
tabi are white <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cotton</ENAMEX> socks with a practical cleft between big and
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> toe to go under thong sandals, but as a beige <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">leather</ENAMEX>, high-heeled boot,
the effect is that of a perfect cloven hoof. I once saw these being worn in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX>. Emerging casually from under a pair of pants, they made my hair stand on
end.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Suggestive</ENAMEX> shoe artifice comes in many varieties. One
curious example by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Junya Watanabe</ENAMEX> is a flat shoe draped and upholstered in rose
and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX> brocade, so that each foot becomes a rich little shoe-shaped cushion
at the nethermost point of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>. Opposed to that is the lethal weapon
style, which usually involves a fierce high heel, often skinny and slanted in
an odd direction, like a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-open switchblade, with fastenings for the shoe
that run to grim <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">metallic buckles</ENAMEX> or very toothy zippers. Even fiercer is a
high-heeled sandal by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Todd Oldham</ENAMEX> with straps of spiky barbed wire that cross
the foot and climb up around the calf. This sandal seems to attack the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wearer</ENAMEX>'s
tender skin and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewer</ENAMEX>'s horrified eye together, until we learn from the
label that it's really all made of soft <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rubber</ENAMEX> and must feel deliciously
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tickly</ENAMEX>. On the other hand, of course, there's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scholl</ENAMEX>'s health sandal, but
even that wholesome item (in this show, anyway) boasts a leopard-print
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">strap</ENAMEX>.

            A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>'s foot is always
engaged in a tense visual dialogue with her shoe, demonstrating its own shape
and flexibility against the shoe's claims, displaying its own erotic capacities
in tandem with those of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">suggestive</ENAMEX> object. Here we see how high heels can
be globular or pyramidal, golden or barklike, slim as bending flower stems or
thick as beams; straps can be suave ribbons or stiff manacles. Shapes are
mostly variants of the mule and the pump, the oxford and the moccasin, the boot
and the sandal, the muffin and the hot <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX>. Decoration can be applied as
studded rhinestones, layered feathers, rows of silk rosebuds, festoons of
chain, fringes of beads, or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sprays</ENAMEX> of embroidery; or as stitched-on leather
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">appliqu√©s</ENAMEX>--why not glued-on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peas</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beans</ENAMEX>? Beyond leather, materials may be
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fur</ENAMEX> and fabric, rubber and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vinyl</ENAMEX>, metal and wood, paper and string, maybe meat
and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">potatoes</ENAMEX>, maybe glass. Fastenings are often laces--these never lose their
cool, even after millennia--or else the kinds used for clothes and belts, most
recently snaps and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Velcro</ENAMEX>. Buttons seem to have lost out. Once, every
well-dressed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> owned a buttonhook--a small, question-mark-shaped steel
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tool</ENAMEX>, often with an ivory handle. Now we're quite willing to button a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shirt</ENAMEX> or
a pair of pants, but apparently not a boot.

            At the end, following these ranks of erotic, dangerous,
comic, elegant, or perversely masculine female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">footgear</ENAMEX>, comes the "<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sneaker</ENAMEX>
Chic" section. Now we enter the huge athletic universe of canvas and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rubber</ENAMEX>,
with all its high-tech spinoffs and hangers-on. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Manolo Blahnik</ENAMEX> gives way to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acupuncture</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Balance</ENAMEX>, to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reebok</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adidas</ENAMEX>, and the host of others
stemming from the original <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keds</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1917</TIMEX>. Here, all feet are big. Gender becomes
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">irrelevant</ENAMEX>, the erotic pull comes only from the thing itself. In this world,
the watchwords are stability, traction, and support. But no one is fooled: The
look is the true issue. So potent is the element of style in active sport shoes
that great fashion <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designers</ENAMEX> have gone for it, producing <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">hybrids</ENAMEX> such as
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gaultier</ENAMEX>'s spike-heeled sneakers, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chanel</ENAMEX>'s black deck-shoe-cum-sneaker,
with the big double C gleaming on its white toe.

            Fashion is at its most
volatile in the sport shoe world. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hip</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">insider models</ENAMEX> can die in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few months</TIMEX>,
if the mainstream adopts them, and be quickly replaced by new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cult favorites</ENAMEX>.
Much urban chic thus dwells in beautifully engineered shoes built for strain
but worn by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who would never dream of putting them to the test. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beau</ENAMEX>
Brummell, who invented modern urban cool in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1790s</TIMEX>, would thoroughly approve
of such delicate perversity. Only style is the true test. Utility is really of
no interest, but its presence is essential. It governs the beauty of the
shoe.

            Since that's the point, the foot retreats from the visual
game, and the enveloping shoe leads its own bright life. As we move along the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">showcase</ENAMEX>, these shoes begin more and more to resemble pairs of small sports
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> and to suggest similar methods of marketing and design. Here we find the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vivid</ENAMEX> brand names, the poetic model names, the features invented for their
function but displayed for their looks--all evoking motion, action, swift
personal transport, perhaps into a better world.

            This show is on until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 17</TIMEX>. If you go, don't
forget to buy the illuminating book by its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">curator</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valerie Steele</ENAMEX>. It's full
of keen insights and dazzling supplementary photos showing many of the shoes at
work. Book and show together will have you rushing out shopping yet again.
