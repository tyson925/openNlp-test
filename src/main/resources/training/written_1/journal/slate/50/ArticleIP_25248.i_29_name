            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Three weeks ago</TIMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX>
launched its airstrikes against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yugoslavia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> swore off further
talks with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Yugoslav</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Slobodan Milosevic</ENAMEX> and ruled out a ground
invasion. Since then, events have obliged <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> to rethink his options. he
floated weasel words that would let him wage a ground war while calling it
something else. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">This week</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aides</ENAMEX> are floating weasel words for the
opposite scenario: negotiations.

            Now that everyone has
declared <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milosevic</ENAMEX> a war criminal and has agreed that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>'
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">manhood</ENAMEX> is at stake, the "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> word" is verboten in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX>'s
talk shows, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pundits</ENAMEX> asked various <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> how they could even
"contemplate negotiating with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milosevic</ENAMEX> after what he's done." The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> dutifully ruled out the idea, all the while sketching concessions by
which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milosevic</ENAMEX> could persuade them to halt the bombing. The operative question
is no longer how <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> could dare negotiate with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milosevic</ENAMEX>.
It's how they're doing it already while pretending not to by masking it in less
polite terms. Here are the various characterizations, in ascending order of
preference.

            
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. Cutting a deal. This is the most
noxious formulation, slung as an insult by hawks such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Weekly</ENAMEX>
Standard and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> . "This <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who is engaged in
this massive ethnic cleansing," <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Standard</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">publisher</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Kristol</ENAMEX> spat on
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">This Week</TIMEX> --"We're going [to]cut another deal with him? ... They cannot
cut another deal with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milosevic</ENAMEX>." Warnings against "cutting a deal" are
invariably accompanied by descriptions of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milosevic</ENAMEX> as a "war criminal." The
implication is that cutting a deal with a criminal is unethical, if not
illegal.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. Negotiation. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> hate this word because
it connotes capitulation. They've learned to deflect it by juxtaposing it with
"bombing." When asked on <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Face the Nation</ENAMEX> whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> would
"negotiate" with a "war criminal," Deputy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary of State</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Strobe Talbott</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sternly</ENAMEX> replied: "We're not negotiating with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milosevic</ENAMEX>. We're bombing him."
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Ambassador</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Macedonia Christopher Hill</ENAMEX> likewise told <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNN</ENAMEX>: "We're not
negotiating right now. We're conducting an air campaign." The false,
glossed-over premise that bombing and negotiation are incompatible goes
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">unchallenged</ENAMEX>.

            Indeed, in this case,
the bombing is part of the negotiation. While hitting <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milosevic</ENAMEX> over the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX> is offering terms under which it is willing to stop. Conversely,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milosevic</ENAMEX> is offering lesser concessions. Though <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX> rejected his initial
offer, the latest proposals by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.N.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary-General</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kofi</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Annan</ENAMEX>--which would suspend the bombing in exchange for partial compliance with
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX>'s demands and would put the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Nations</ENAMEX>, rather than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX>, in charge of
settling the conflict--suggest there will ultimately be a compromise. A few
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days ago</TIMEX>, when a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> asked about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> word, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lockhart</ENAMEX> answered, "We have a military objective now, which is to bring
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milosevic</ENAMEX> to meet these conditions that we have laid out." By calling
this objective "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">military</ENAMEX>," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aides</ENAMEX> obscure its negotiatory aspect.

            
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. Diplomacy. Like negotiation, this word
smells of weakness. Again, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> deflect it by contrasting
it with a tougher word: "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX>." "<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Fourteen</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months ago</TIMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milosevic</ENAMEX> started
this crisis, our policy was one of diplomacy backed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX>," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Talbott</ENAMEX> argued
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last weekend</TIMEX>. "Now we have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> backed by diplomacy." <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary of State</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madeleine Albright</ENAMEX> and her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jamie Rubin</ENAMEX>, are fond of the same
formulation. But the contrast between "diplomacy" and "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX>" is just as
deceptive as the contrast between "negotiation" and "bombing." <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX> hopes to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bomb Milosevic</ENAMEX> to the table. Therefore, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> is still serving diplomacy.

            
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. Political solution. This is the
administration's code word for "deal." <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> says he wants a "political
solution." <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albright</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rubin</ENAMEX> want "a political settlement" and a "political
framework based on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rambouillet</ENAMEX>." Toward that end, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albright</ENAMEX> welcomes <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX>'s
"support for dealing with the problem in a political way." <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last week</TIMEX>, when a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> asked whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> wanted <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> to undertake "diplomatic
mediation with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Belgrade</ENAMEX>," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rubin</ENAMEX> replied, "I would put it a little differently.
... The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russians</ENAMEX> have been part and parcel of our effort to try to find a
peaceful solution." <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rubin</ENAMEX> expressed hope that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russians</ENAMEX> might succeed in
"convincing the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Serbs</ENAMEX> to turn around" and "accept our conditions." But
diplomacy? Never.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>. Harder and harder. Part of the indignity
of negotiation is the implication that during the bargaining <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX> will offer
more and more concessions. So, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesmen</ENAMEX> tailor their words to create
the opposite impression: that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX> will offer fewer and fewer concessions as
the conflict wears on. As <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Cohen</ENAMEX> put it <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX>, "every
day that goes by" with further evidence of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milosevic</ENAMEX>'s "brutality" would "make
it far more difficult to deal with him."

            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last week</TIMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX>
asked <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lockhart</ENAMEX> whether it was "right for an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">negotiator</ENAMEX> now to sit down
with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milosevic</ENAMEX> to try to cut some deal." <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lockhart</ENAMEX> replied that such a scenario
"gets harder <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX>. But I am not going to ... rule anything out." The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> pressed: "But it's not off the table yet?" <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lockhart</ENAMEX> answered: "Dealing
with him gets harder." When asked whether "at some point" dealing with
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milosevic</ENAMEX> would "become impossible," Lockhart scoffed, "I am not going to spell
out a timetable or what he has to do." Refusing to "spell out" demands or to
"rule anything out" is a classic negotiating posture--which Lockhart
effectively obscured by repeating the word "harder" <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> times during the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">exchange</ENAMEX>.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>. Demands. This is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>'s favorite
description. Confronted recently with a coarse question as to whether the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX> was "willing to talk to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milosevic</ENAMEX>," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lockhart</ENAMEX> stonily replied,
"The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">alliance</ENAMEX> has made demands, and he needs to meet them." Lest anyone
confuse these demands with negotiation, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albright</ENAMEX> insisted, "We're not trying to
please <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milosevic</ENAMEX>. ... The goal of this is to be able to get him to
understand these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> demands that the international community is making."
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> also speak of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX>'s "terms," "conditions," and
"requirements." There was only one slip-up <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rubin</ENAMEX> referred to
them as "our position."

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>'s spin is that "demands" and
"conditions" are the opposite of "negotiation." <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milosevic</ENAMEX> "knows precisely what
the conditions are, so we're not negotiating," <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Ambassador</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hill</ENAMEX> declared on
Late Edition <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last weekend</TIMEX>. On <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Meet the Press</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> Chief
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Staff</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Podesta</ENAMEX> vowed: "We're not negotiating, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tim</ENAMEX>. He knows what he
needs to do to stop the war. ... That's not a negotiation." But <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> later,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe Biden</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Del.</ENAMEX>, betrayed the spin: "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">No</ENAMEX>, I don't think we can negotiate
with him--if you mean can we, in fact, work out something other than those
minimal demands that were stated" by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX>. It depends, in short, upon what the
meaning of the word "negotiation" is.

            If the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.N.</ENAMEX>
proposals lead to a settlement with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milosevic</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diplomats</ENAMEX> will
have to finesse the discrepancy between the "demands" they touted and the deal
they signed. Somehow I'm confident they can work it out.
