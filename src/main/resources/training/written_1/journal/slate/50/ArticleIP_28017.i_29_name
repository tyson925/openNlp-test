            Except in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>, the world economic crisis seems to
have gone into at least temporary remission, and those who have been obsessing
about the subject are turning their attention back to other matters. In my
case, that means making a big push on my introductory economics
textbook-in-progress. And so a little while ago I found myself redrafting the
chapters on, yes, supply and demand.

            Now, my textbook is a
labor of love; but it is also a commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">venture</ENAMEX> (or at least I and my
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">publisher</ENAMEX> hope it is!). So, the first draft was tested on a focus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>: people
who are successful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> of introductory economics at the sort of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> we
hope will adopt the book. I learned a lot from the focus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. Among other
things, I learned that what a middle-aged college <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> thinks of as
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">down-to-earth</ENAMEX> examples of economics in action might not always sound quite so
down to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">earth</ENAMEX> to the ordinary college <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">freshman</ENAMEX>, and that I had to have more
examples the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clientele</ENAMEX> could relate to--which means, in particular,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sports</ENAMEX> . One focus group <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> suggested that the market for "scalped"
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sports</ENAMEX> tickets was a good example of supply and demand in action. So, I did
some background research and found some very interesting stuff. But perhaps it
is an indicator of my <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of mind that what I saw during that research made
me think, once again, about .

            Ticket scalping is nothing new, though it continues to pose
something of an economic puzzle. The fact is that there are a number of public
events--most notably sports, but also concerts, plays, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> shows, etc.--for
which tickets are consistently sold below the price that would limit demand to
the available supply. Exactly why the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stadiums</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">theaters</ENAMEX> do this
is a matter of some dispute. One theory (due to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gary Becker</ENAMEX>)
is that tickets are underpriced because those who sell them believe that it is
crucial to their image to have sold-out <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>. Beyond this, many <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stadium</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">theater</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> seem to believe that as an overall marketing strategy it is
important that access to their most popular events be available to enthusiasts
at moderate prices. For example, why doesn't <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">George Lucas</ENAMEX> allow <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">theaters</ENAMEX> to
offer special preview showings of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Phantom Menace</ENAMEX> at astronomical
(galactic?) prices, when surely they could find <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">tens or even hundreds of</NUMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of people able and willing to pay? Presumably because so blatant a
statement that wealth hath its privileges would alienate <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">the tens of millions</NUMEX>
of nonwealthy moviegoers he counts on to turn the film into a megahit. Whatever
the precise reasoning, what is clear is that when it comes to big games and big
shows, private sector <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">entrepreneurs</ENAMEX> themselves often feel that it is a bad idea
to let market forces rule.

            Enter the scalpers. If
they can, scalpers will buy up large numbers of tickets directly from the box
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> and resell them at a profit. If the box office refuses to sell in bulk,
they will offer to buy spare tickets from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who have come by them
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">legitimately</ENAMEX> and perhaps hire <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to stand in line. What's wrong with that?
Well, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who run the box office are attempting to pursue social
goals--albeit in the ultimate name of profit--which require that tickets go not
only to those who can afford to pay a lot but also to those who really care and
are willing to book early and/or stand in line. If tickets sell out long in
advance not to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enthusiasts</ENAMEX> but to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speculators</ENAMEX>, or if the long lines consist not
of dedicated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fans</ENAMEX> but of hired proxies, this attempt to pursue a long-term
agenda is defeated. And so there is a running conflict between the long-run
thinking represented by the box <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> and the short-run market forces
represented by scalpers--a conflict that seems increasingly to be running in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scalpers</ENAMEX>' favor.

            Why does scalping seem ever harder to control? <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> reason
is that because of the rising inequality of income and wealth, there are more
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> out there able and willing to pay extraordinary sums. This is above all
true in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>, where there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who will not blanch at
paying <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$10,000</NUMEX> to see and be seen at a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Knicks</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">game</ENAMEX>. But scalping is also on the
rise because of an interaction between technology and ideology.

            It's clear that technology has made scalping much
more efficient than in the past. Once upon a time it was a hands-on business.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Shady characters</ENAMEX> would hang around <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stadiums</ENAMEX> offering to buy tickets at a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">premium</ENAMEX> or to sell them at an even larger premium. Those shady <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> are
still there, but you can also look up big-ticket <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brokers</ENAMEX> on the Web, call their
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">800</ENAMEX> numbers, and comfortably conduct your transaction from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>. This
makes it easy for the out-of-town <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitor</ENAMEX> to line up tickets for that special
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</TIMEX> or for the hard-driving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> to impress his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX>. It also means
that everyone who has bought a ticket at the box office knows that the true
cost of going to the show is not the sum he actually paid but the much larger
sum he could make by reselling that ticket.

            Still, the technology
would not be as effective as it is were it not for a favorable ideological
climate. While there are anti-scalping laws in many places--such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">City</ENAMEX>--there are also a growing number of places, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Jersey</ENAMEX>, that
believe in letting the market rip and therefore allow tickets to be freely
resold at any price. And given modern communications technology, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">New Yorkers</ENAMEX>
need not physically visit <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Jersey</ENAMEX> to do an end run around the local
regulations.

            And so the pressure on box <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> steadily intensifies.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Box</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> do fight back. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A couple years ago</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Madison Square Garden</ENAMEX>,
discovering that many of its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX> ticket <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holders</ENAMEX> were reselling them to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brokers</ENAMEX>, revoked <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of tickets in a stroke. And the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> spending
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX> in line to see <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Phantom Menace are</ENAMEX>, as far as anyone knows,
genuine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fanatics</ENAMEX> rather than hirelings. Still, it is hard to escape the feeling
that these are rear-guard actions. We seem to be heading for a future in which
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX> at a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Knicks</ENAMEX> game will consist mainly of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">businessmen</ENAMEX> on expense
accounts--and, so the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Madison Square Garden</ENAMEX> fears, a longer-term
future in which serious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Knicks</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fans</ENAMEX>, finding that they can't afford tickets,
lose interest, and therefore so do the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">businessmen</ENAMEX>. Short-run market pressures
may eventually leave everyone worse off; and yet they seem to be getting harder
and harder to defy--which brings me to global finance.

            To my mind, at least, there is a sort of family
resemblance between the phenomenon of ticket scalping and the problem of
hot-money flows in the world economy. In both cases there is some efficiency
case to be made in their favor. Ticket scalping does allow some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who
badly want to see a game or show to do so. Short-term capital flows do
sometimes provide badly needed finance or liquidity. In both cases, however,
there are also costs--whether to the social mix that sustains a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fan</ENAMEX> base
or to the macroeconomic stability that sustains long-term economic growth.
Stadium <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> have judged these costs to be large enough to warrant serious
attempts to limit scalping; and given the experience of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last two years</TIMEX>, you
don't have to be an anti-market fanatic to argue that some limits on hot money
would also be a good thing, if feasible.

            But the trouble is that between technology that
makes it easier for markets to run rings around local regulations, and the
reluctance of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> to agree on the sort of cross-border <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enforcement</ENAMEX> that
might let them keep up with that technology, efforts to limit the market . Oh,
mavericks such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">George Lucas</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malaysia</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prime Minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mahathir</ENAMEX> bin
Muhammad may try to fight the trend and even achieve some limited success, but
they are swimming against the tide. Indeed, as this article was being written,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lucas</ENAMEX>--under intense pressure from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">theater</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX>--gave in to the dark side of
market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX>. Some tickets to <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Phantom Menace will</ENAMEX>, indeed, be sold
in advance--and no doubt be snapped up by scalpers.
