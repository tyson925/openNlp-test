cover story on the future of technology forecasts a post-PC
world where household appliances are connected to the Internet and each other.
Your sprinkler will check with the weather service before it waters the lawn,
your refrigerator will order more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk</ENAMEX> when your carton expires, and your
toilet will test your <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">emissions</ENAMEX> and notify your health-care <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">provider</ENAMEX> when
you're out of sorts. ... <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Gates</ENAMEX>, by contrast, envisions a
PC-plus future , where the PC will remain the primary
computing tool but will be integrated with other smart devices.

bomb threats. A piece argues that smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> might be an antidote to the
gargantuan high <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adolescents</ENAMEX> anonymously drift into deep trouble
and despair.

<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">destabilize Yugoslav</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Slobodan Milosevic</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Kosovar</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rebels</ENAMEX> will be
trained to commit acts of sabotage such as cutting telephone wires, ruining gas
reserves, and launching cyberattacks against secret bank accounts where
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milosevic</ENAMEX> has stowed <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">millions of dollars</NUMEX>, presumably pilfered from his

Bernall as she affirmed her faith in God. Post-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Littleton</ENAMEX>, campus <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christians</ENAMEX> are

later refused re-enlistment by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Army</ENAMEX> because of trumped-up charges of
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Communist</ENAMEX> activity. He was posthumously awarded the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Medal of Honor</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ago</TIMEX>, but his family still awaits an apology. ... A piece describes the fervent campaigning for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this summer</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iowa</ENAMEX>
straw poll. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Underdog Republican</ENAMEX> presidential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> are seizing it as their
chance for a breakthrough. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Frontrunner</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gov.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George W. Bush</ENAMEX> faces a dilemma: If
he participates, he risks losing to the social <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conservatives</ENAMEX> who dominate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GOP</ENAMEX>
straw polls; if he skips the poll, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iowans</ENAMEX> may spurn him in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February</TIMEX>'s
all-important caucuses. ... Parents are abandoning the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTA</ENAMEX> in droves for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> that are more local and hard-hitting, says a report . The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTA</ENAMEX>'s reformist mandate--it pioneered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>,
hot lunches, and kindergartens--has degenerated into mere boosterism.

            The
magazine gleefully anticipates a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> race between <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary Clinton</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rudolph Giuliani</ENAMEX>: "It feels like a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> subsidy for wayward <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalists</ENAMEX>."

attributes both his psychologically probing cinematic style and his tumultuous
love life to his emotionally frigid <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>. ... An article defends Chai
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ling</ENAMEX>, who led the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Tiananmen Square</ENAMEX> protests and now runs an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> Internet
start-up, from charges of selling out and, more gravely, of guiding the
protests with naive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">extremism</ENAMEX>.

            The
cover package forecasts <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Gore</ENAMEX>'s electoral strategy. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> piece says the veep
is likely to take credit for wiring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> to the Internet--even
though this wiring is subsidized by a "universal service charge" on everyone's
phone bill. Another article admits that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tipper Gore</ENAMEX> is a political asset but
warns darkly of her agenda. She appears to be an apolitical soccer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mom</ENAMEX>, but
she's actually a liberal do-gooder and her advocacy of mental-health issues
threatens to increase health-care costs for most <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>. ... The

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Summers</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Rubin</ENAMEX> clone. Unlike <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rubin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Summers</ENAMEX> believes in lots of

            The
cover story protests the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>'s failure to hike
interest rates despite early signs of inflation. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Greenspan</ENAMEX>'s laxity is
encouraging "speculative excesses." Since higher interest rates take <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> to
restrain economic expansion, postponing a hike is like waiting "to brake a
runaway <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> until it is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a few feet</NUMEX> from the cliff's edge." (For a dissent, see
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX>'s .) ... The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> instructs new <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israeli</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prime Minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ehud Barak</ENAMEX> "to

possession. (The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX> asserted that most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defendants</ENAMEX> demand jury
trials "for no good reason other than to delay proceedings.")

            The
cover story argues that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary Clinton</ENAMEX>'s senatorial
run would harm <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX> whether she won or lost. She would "divert resources
from other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX>, politicize their races in ways that don't play well
beyond the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Upper West Side</ENAMEX>, and become a rallying point for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conservatives</ENAMEX> still
itching to exploit anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> sentiment," thus thwarting <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democratic</ENAMEX> efforts
nationwide. ... The "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">TRB "</ENAMEX> column tells <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> not to fret over the rising cost of
health care. The expenditures are worth it because the care they fund is

convoluted draft than coherent novel. The radical surgery performed by his
