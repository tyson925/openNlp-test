Wrap-Up
               

               To play <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News Quiz</ENAMEX>
requires the willful suspension not of disbelief but of genuine knowledge: An
awareness of the actual answer so easily eclipses the inspiration for a comic
response. And, clearly, everyone knew the facts of the matter <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>. But
there's more about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colorado</ENAMEX> you might not know. To condense from (but not
otherwise alter) <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960</TIMEX> edition of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Book Encyclopedia</ENAMEX>: "<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">About two</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">thirds</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colorado</ENAMEX> live no more. ... Streams tumbling down from

... He surveyed friendly relations." In this context, it's hard to know what
makes a kaffeeklatsch odd. Or a klatsch.

Answer
               

               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Luis Felipe</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin Kings</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> convicted of
murder and racketeering, is about to join <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oklahoma City</ENAMEX> bomber <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Timothy McVeigh</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Trade Center</ENAMEX> bomber <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ramzi Ahmed Yousef</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Unabomber Ted Kaczynski</ENAMEX> for
conversation in the exercise yard at the federal "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Super Max</ENAMEX>" <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prison</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Florence</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colo.</ENAMEX>

               Kept in solitary confinement <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">23 hours a day</TIMEX> in
<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">7-by</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> cells, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> can not even look into the eyes of another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prisoner</ENAMEX>.
They are permitted to spend <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one hour</TIMEX> per day in separate cages in the exercise
yard, where they can speak to each other through mesh fences.

               Because <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Felipe</ENAMEX> is believed to have ordered murders
from his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> in a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prison</ENAMEX>, he has been kept even more isolated, but a
ruling by federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Martin</ENAMEX> allows <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Felipe</ENAMEX> into the exercise yard.

               The conversation? <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yousef</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bernard Klienman</ENAMEX>,
said, "They talk about innocuous things like the movies. They don't talk about
anything they shouldn't be talking about."

               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven Cohen</ENAMEX> was a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecutor</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Latin Kings</ENAMEX> case.
