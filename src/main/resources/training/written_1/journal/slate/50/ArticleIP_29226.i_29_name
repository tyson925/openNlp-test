                  Dear
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudence</ENAMEX>,
               
            

            
               When behind the
wheel of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>, I would never consider parking in a spot designated for a
fellow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">driver</ENAMEX> with disabilities, as I don't belong to this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. However, when
shopping or recreating and in need of a public <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">restroom</ENAMEX>, I always opt for the
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bathroom stall</ENAMEX> designed for my fellow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> with disabilities. (They are
uniformly more spacious, better stocked, and I like the handrails.) I have yet
to emerge from such a spot to find someone more deserving of such amenities
cooling their heels (so to speak), and since my caffeine intake is too high,
these pit stops are more or less regular events. Am I being callous and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">insensitive</ENAMEX>, or appropriately opportunistic?
            

            

               --<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Doubting</ENAMEX>
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dear Doubt</ENAMEX>,

            Funny you should bring
this up. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudie</ENAMEX> does exactly the same thing, preferring, as you do, the larger
space, along with the private mirror and sink. Like you, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudie</ENAMEX> has never seen
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">disabled person</ENAMEX> waiting, though that would not be the end of the world.
Considering the length of time one may park vs. the time needed in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">restroom</ENAMEX>, the issues are clearly different. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prudie</ENAMEX> often sees <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> take the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">handicapped</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stall</ENAMEX> simply because it becomes available <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudie</ENAMEX> is hardly
ever in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> ... unless, of course, it is an individual <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bathroom</ENAMEX>, and
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> is taken.)

                  Dear
Prudie,
               
            

            
               I am surrounded by exercise nuts, both in my
family and at work. Almost everybody I know is either coming from or going to
the gym. I am a size <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>, feel fit, and make it my business to walk wherever I
can--sometimes skipping the elevator or the escalator.
            

            
               Could it be that
I should be engaging in a more formal kind of exercise? My health is
good, by the by.
            

            

               --<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Black Sheep</ENAMEX>
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dear Black</ENAMEX>,

            This must be <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudie</ENAMEX>'s
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week</TIMEX> for identifying with her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">correspondents</ENAMEX>, for she could not agree with you
more. Too many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are too involved with lats and pecs and excessive
sweating. The important thing is just to move ... somehow, somewhere. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudie</ENAMEX>'s
philosophy is the same as the very wise <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carol Leifer</ENAMEX>'s: "No pain, no pain."

            
--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudie</ENAMEX>, cautiously

            
               
                  Dear
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudence</ENAMEX>,
               
            

            
               A longtime <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> is
getting married to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> of whom I am not a big <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fan</ENAMEX>. This is my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX>'s second
marriage, but at her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fiance</ENAMEX>'s insistence, she is once again having a full-blown
formal affair--including all the gift registries. I do not want to get them a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gift</ENAMEX> (or at least an expensive <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>). I gave my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> a very special and
expensive gift for her first marriage, and I know the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time around she
received every gift one might give to a newly married <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX>. What is my
obligation here? Am I letting my feelings for her fiance influence me too
much?
            

            

               --<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TH</ENAMEX>
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dear T</ENAMEX>,

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudie</ENAMEX>'s instinct tells
her your feelings are less about her fiance and more about your finances. And
this is all right. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudie</ENAMEX>'s rule for the serially married may be roughly stated
as <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">One Knock-Your-Eyes-Out Gift Per Bride Per Lifetime</ENAMEX>. There are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, by
the way, who feel that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> full-dress blowouts is pushing it a little.
Of course you must crash through with something, but it can be both modest and
in good taste. And for your own tranquility, when you write the card have your
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ladyfriend</ENAMEX> in mind, not the groom, so that your warmer feelings will be read
between the lines.

            
--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudie</ENAMEX>, festively

            
               
                  Dear
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudence</ENAMEX>,
               
            

            
               My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">wedding</ENAMEX> was beautiful. The reception was lovely, too, and when the time came
for my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> to toss her bouquet, all the single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> gathered. So did the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> at the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">wedding</TIMEX>, my <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> nieces. They range in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 to 13</TIMEX>, but
the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10-year-old</TIMEX> is an especially energetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>--and tall for her age, too.
So, before the toss, I dashed over to whisper in her ear that there were older
ladies right behind her and to take care not to trip them. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of those ladies
was my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX>'s new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother-in-law</ENAMEX>, who is my age, which is to say, not old
... just not agile enough in high heels to compete with an athletic little girl
who may not know her own strength. My niece did indeed catch the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">bouquet</ENAMEX>, and
no one was hurt. My question is this: Should <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> not old enough to date,
much less marry, be included in the bouquet toss? I don't think wild <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX>
could have kept those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> away, but I'm wondering if this is a new
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">custom</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dear Bride's</ENAMEX>,

            The catch-the-bouquet
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">custom</ENAMEX> is meant as symbolic fun. No one really thinks the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">catcher</ENAMEX> is destined
to become the next <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bride</ENAMEX>. And certainly no one expects an injury to result,
meaning, of course, that decorum should be maintained at all times.

                  Dear
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudence</ENAMEX>,
               
            

            
               You and your
correspondent "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">"</ENAMEX> should both read the recently published Silicone
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spills</ENAMEX> , by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary White Stewart</ENAMEX>. Anyone with a bit of scientific or legal
knowledge of implants (whether silicone or saline) would never dream of having
them. Factual knowledge is important in making any decision, especially one
like this.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dear P</ENAMEX>,

            Ah, yes, the old
conundrum of dueling scientific findings. Without wishing to become
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amazon.</ENAMEX>Prudie, you and any other interested <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> might wish to read the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">authoritative</ENAMEX> book <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Science on Trial: The Clash of Medical Evidence and the</ENAMEX>
Law in the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Breast Implant Case</ENAMEX> , by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marcia Angell</ENAMEX>.
