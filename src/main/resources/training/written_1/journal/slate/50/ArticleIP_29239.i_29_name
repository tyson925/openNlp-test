               The author of a
new book charges that a prominent <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> not only betrayed him, but also
"[h]is mocking pronunciation of my name ... sounded like a jeering <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mob</ENAMEX>." Who is
this insensitive <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX>, and how did he mispronounce the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>'s
name?

               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Randy</ENAMEX>'s Overly
Sensitive Wrap-Up
            

            While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News Quiz</ENAMEX> has avidly solicited sardonic
comments on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kosovo</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Littleton</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abner Louima</ENAMEX> case confounds me. I
understand a joke with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Volpe</ENAMEX> punch line or a joke about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYPD</ENAMEX>'s sincere
efforts to increase minority recruitment (no kidding, this time they mean it)
or to make the many other reforms persistently resisted by both the department
and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mayor</ENAMEX> (I'm serious, this time they really, really mean it). But I do
not feel comfortable with a punch line that alludes to the plunger. And while I
don't think I've received a single response to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s question that seeks to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">trivialize Louima</ENAMEX>'s suffering, I still feel uneasy, and so I've omitted those
replies. It is, of course, a matter of sensibility. No <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">offense</ENAMEX> meant. Now
everyone go on out and tease a fat <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> on me.

            No, wait, come back. I

               The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Right Tools</ENAMEX>
for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Job Answer</ENAMEX>
            

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hartford Police Department</ENAMEX> is not hiding its
new armored personnel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carrier</ENAMEX>.

            And, besides, they prefer to call it a "tactical
rescue <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicle</ENAMEX>," says <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Capt.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fallon</ENAMEX>. "I call my night stick a 'happy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wand</ENAMEX>' and
my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">gun</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a 'puppy</NUMEX>,' " he did not add.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> has
stocked up on pepper <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spray</ENAMEX> and smoke bombs and has given additional riot
training to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX>, alarming many <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hartford</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX>, tensely awaiting a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecutor</ENAMEX>'s decision about whether to charge a white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> who fatally shot
a black <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14-year-old</TIMEX> in the back. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Police Chief</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Croughwell</ENAMEX> denies that he
is preparing to suppress a riot. He does understand how these misconceptions
can occur, "I can see how <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> would add <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one and one</NUMEX> and get <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>." Or
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>.

out.

            
               The
Twaddle
            

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. "The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who are
crazy enough to think they can change the world, they do."

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. "We must take
responsibility for the society that our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> live in. We must teach them
the sense of right and wrong, good and evil."

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. "Real fulfillment in
your life will come not from leisure, not from idleness, not from
self-indulgence, but rather from striving with all your physical and spiritual
might for a worthwhile objective."

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. "If you are like me,
you are far more likely to regret what you did not do than what you do do."

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>. "Let us realize that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">education</ENAMEX> is the greatest anti-poverty program."

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>. "The only certainty is
that there is no certainty."

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>. "Your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> have been
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">builders</ENAMEX>. Wouldn't it be wonderful if you could be the healers."

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>. "It is more important
than ever that we be staunch in our convictions."

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>. "We must think bigger
and do better."
