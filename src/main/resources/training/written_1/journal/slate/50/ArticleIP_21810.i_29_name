            Online auctions are the
Internet flavor of the moment. The best-known auction site, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eBay</ENAMEX>, went public
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 1998</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$18</NUMEX> and shot up to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$47</NUMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of its first day</TIMEX>. It's
now at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $150</NUMEX>, which means that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> value the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">around $20</NUMEX>
billion despite <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">only $47 million</NUMEX> in sales over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last 12 months</TIMEX>. Traditional
businesses want in on online auctions as well. You have until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 21, 1999</TIMEX>,
for instance, to bid on the pink satin eye mask <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Faye Dunaway</ENAMEX> wore in Mommie
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dearest</ENAMEX> (current high bid: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$650</NUMEX>) at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Universalstudios</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">com</ENAMEX>.

            A technology that allows
you to bid on a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1970</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ch√¢teau Lafite-Rothschild</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wine</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$205</NUMEX>) without leaving
your study is impressive. But it cannot repeal the laws of economics. One such
law is dubbed the "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">winner</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">curse</ENAMEX>" and holds that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">winner</ENAMEX> of an auction
almost always overpays. As an understanding of this law makes clear, online
auctions make the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">winner</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">curse</ENAMEX> even worse.

            Auctions are often thought of as models of economic
efficiency, uniting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sellers</ENAMEX> at just the right price to maximize
their mutual satisfaction, put resources to their highest and best use, and so
on. But <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> petroleum <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineers</ENAMEX> writing in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal of Petroleum</ENAMEX>
Technology explained in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1971</TIMEX> why this is not the case.

            Suppose several petroleum
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX> are bidding on the drilling rights to a piece of tundra. No <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX> is sure
how much <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> is underneath the property, so they hire a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineers</ENAMEX> to
poke at the surface rocks and make a guess. The guesses will likely range from
too low to too high. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineer</ENAMEX> will probably guess right, but that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX> won't win the auction. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">winner</ENAMEX> will be the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX> whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineer</ENAMEX> was the
most overoptimistic. The winning <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX> won't ultimately get as much oil as their
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineers</ENAMEX> promised, meaning the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX> paid too much. In short, the auction
"<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">winner</ENAMEX>" is ultimately a loser.

            This is a particularly clear example because the thing
being auctioned will have a definite value in the future that is unknowable at
present. But the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">winner</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">curse</ENAMEX> afflicts auction <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bidders</ENAMEX> whenever there is
uncertainty over the current or eventual value of the item on the block. This
is true even when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bidders</ENAMEX> have no intention of reselling the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">item</ENAMEX> and when its
innate value seems inherently subjective.

            For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bidders</ENAMEX> for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Faye Dunaway</ENAMEX>'s pink eye mask must make some judgment on how much they care
about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Faye Dunaway</ENAMEX>. If that were all, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">winner</ENAMEX> would likely be the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> who
cared the most. That would be economically efficient in two senses: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) the
utility of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dunaway</ENAMEX>'s eye mask would be maximized by placing it with the person
who can extract the greatest pleasure from it (just as, uncertainty aside, the
highest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bidder</ENAMEX> for an oil field will be the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> who can extract the most oil
from it); and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> would pay no more for the eye mask than the
pleasure of owning it was worth to him.

            But the course of love is as uncertain as the petroleum
content of a pile of rocks. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Bidders</ENAMEX> must also try to guess how much they'll
care for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Faye Dunaway</ENAMEX> in, say, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 years</TIMEX>. The more you overestimate your undying
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">affection</ENAMEX>, the more likely you are to win the auction--and the more likely you
are to feel like an idiot in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2009</TIMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Economists</ENAMEX> have pointed
out that if <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bidders</ENAMEX> were truly rational, they'd simply reduce their bids to
correct for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">winner</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">curse</ENAMEX>. There is even a mathematical proof that a
perfectly rational <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actor</ENAMEX> can avoid the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">curse</ENAMEX>. But experimental evidence
suggests that even experienced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bidders</ENAMEX> don't reduce their bids by enough. For
instance, a study of oil field auctions shows that even seasoned firms
typically pay far too much for drilling rights given the amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> they
eventually recover. The same phenomenon has been observed when corporate
takeover <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wizards</ENAMEX> bid on other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>--the "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">winner</ENAMEX>" often overpays. In other
words, oil <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX> and corporate takeover <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX> keep on getting burned in
auctions but persist in bidding too high. They simply don't learn.

            Irritatingly, a rational <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> who understands the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">winner</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">curse</ENAMEX> can't do anything about it so long as the other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bidders</ENAMEX> continue
to bid irrationally. If you bid rationally (lower), you won't win any auctions;
if you bid what it takes to win auctions (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">higher</NUMEX>), you'll lose money because of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">winner</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">curse</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Economist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Thaler</ENAMEX> wickedly suggests a solution:
Explain the theory to your <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">competitors</ENAMEX>. He posits that this is exactly why the
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> oil <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineers</ENAMEX> published their article explaining the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">curse</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1971</TIMEX>. Their
hope was to induce other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX> to reduce their bids. If so, it didn't work,
since oil <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX> continue to overpay.

            Online auctions worsen
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">winner</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">curse</ENAMEX> by increasing the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bidders</ENAMEX>. The craziest poor
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sucker</ENAMEX> in a group of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bidders</ENAMEX> on the Internet is likely to be crazier
than the craziest one among <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> in a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Burbank</ENAMEX> hotel <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ballroom</ENAMEX>. That's another
thing that experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> have confirmed--the larger the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, the
bigger the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">winner</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">curse</ENAMEX>. There's no satisfactory way to buy rare or one of a
kind items, but online auctions are a particularly bad method.

            On the other hand, if <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> at online auctions are
persistently disappointed, it's possible that after a while they'll stop
bidding. It's also possible that experience will lead them to approximate
"rationality," and they'll reduce their bids. Either way, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sellers</ENAMEX> would find
their inflated profits eroded. But auctions have survived the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">winner</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">curse</ENAMEX>
for millenniums, and even the Internet is unlikely to change that.

            To be sure, not all auctions are rip-offs. Remember,
there is no danger of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">winner</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">curse</ENAMEX> if you are sure about the value
of an item to you . In that situation, the auction device serves its
proper purpose of putting the item in the hands of whoever values it the most.
For instance, suppose you are buying a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Beanie Baby</ENAMEX> for your little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> or a
discounted airline ticket to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cabo San Lucas</ENAMEX>. Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX> have a pretty clear
idea of how much pleasure they'll get from their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX>'s smiles or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few days</TIMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sand</ENAMEX> and surf. And sane <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> won't bid more than these respective
pleasures are worth to them--meaning that they can't feel cheated.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">winner</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">curse</ENAMEX> also doesn't apply when there are
many identical items being auctioned off. In those cases, where there is enough
quantity available to satisfy most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bidders</ENAMEX>, the going price will be set by the
sensible middle of the pack rather than by the most overoptimistic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">extremist</ENAMEX>.
The leading example of such an auction is the stock market. So the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">winner</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">curse</ENAMEX> can't explain the extravagant price of shares in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eBay</ENAMEX> itself. Unless, of
course, when it comes to Internet shares there is no sensible middle. If
everyone's gone crazy, economic theory isn't much help.
