Citing long-standing unresolved ethics and safety violations, federal
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> suspended human experimentation at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Duke University Medical Center</ENAMEX>
for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four days</TIMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX>. The experiments ranged from drug tests to research on
psychological reactions to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX>. Among the alleged violations: "insufficient
training" of review <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>, "potential financial conflicts of interest
with some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>," and inadequate supervision of informed-consent
procedures. (Federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> also uncovered an incident in which a
space-walk experiment volunteer briefly lost consciousness.) The ban was lifted
after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Duke</ENAMEX> agreed to overhaul its procedures for protecting human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>. The
government also warned the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">City</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of New York</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mount Sinai</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">School of Medicine</ENAMEX> to clean up their safety
procedures or face shutdowns of their federally financed human research.

               Closed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chambers</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward Lazarus</ENAMEX>' behind-the-scenes exposé of political
wrangling at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX>, continues to generate controversy. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lazarus</ENAMEX>, who clerked for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Justice</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harry Blackmun</ENAMEX>, earned the
opprobrium of legal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX>, other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clerks</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">justices</ENAMEX> for making
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">internal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> in his book, published <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX>. Now <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anthony</ENAMEX>
Kronman, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dean</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yale Law School</ENAMEX> who blurbed the hardcover edition of the
book as "well-researched and wonderfully written," has formally apologized to
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> and sent a letter of explanation to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yale Law School</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alumni</ENAMEX>.
Declaring that his initial enthusiasm for the book constituted a "real lapse"
in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">judgment, Kronman</ENAMEX> said he believes former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clerks</ENAMEX> are bound to silence about
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX>'s nonpublic discussions and activities. According to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>
Today , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kronman</ENAMEX>'s blurb will not appear on the paperback edition of the book
due out <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this month</TIMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Review of Books</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Powers</ENAMEX> stands accused of ignorance,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">incompetence</ENAMEX>, and racial stereotyping by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Native American</ENAMEX> studies scholars
for his review of several books about <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Native Americans</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Powers</ENAMEX>, a

the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX>, led by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Patricia Hilden</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of California at</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berkeley</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arnold Krupat</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sarah Lawrence College</ENAMEX>, who wrote that he had
"little or no detailed knowledge of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Native American</ENAMEX> scholarship" and that he
reproduced tired clichés about <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Native American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">figures</ENAMEX> and traditions. "We are
quite certain that no one of us would be asked to review books in Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Powers</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fields</ENAMEX>," the signatories declared in a letter in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 20</TIMEX> issue. Powers
expressed bafflement at the charges, concluding that the letter "amounts to an
attempt to intimidate ... me from writing about 'their field.' " The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Review</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> concurred: "It is hard to take seriously <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">academics</ENAMEX> who

               Star Wars hoopla visits academia, reports the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dallas Morning</ENAMEX>
News . Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX> view the original Star Wars film as a simplistic
<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Cold War</ENAMEX> allegory that helped to legitimize <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald Reagan</ENAMEX>'s view of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Soviet</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Union</ENAMEX> as an "evil <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX>" and to build popular support for a "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">star wars</ENAMEX>"
missile defense. Others reverse the movie's ideological lenses, arguing that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">filmmaker George Lucas</ENAMEX> based his "evil <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emperor</ENAMEX>" on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Nixon</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Darth</ENAMEX>
Vader on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Kissinger</ENAMEX>. Finally, others charge that Star Wars
represents a covert remake of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Birth of the Nation</ENAMEX> . "The narrative
homologies between <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Birth of a Nation and Star Wars</ENAMEX> click beyond
the possibility of accident," writes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clyde Taylor</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tufts University</ENAMEX>. "<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Darth</ENAMEX>

Affirmative action is good for you, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supporters</ENAMEX> told the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Michigan</ENAMEX>, for one, cites statistical evidence to argue that affirmative
action benefits not only minority <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> but all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>. White <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> who
attend a "diverse" college <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">campus</ENAMEX> are more likely to work in integrated
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">settings</ENAMEX> and to display ambition, confidence, and other worthy traits, the
school attests. "Diversity enhances learning," says university <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bollinger</ENAMEX>. Meanwhile, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times Magazine</ENAMEX> offers a rosy portrait
of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> after the abolition of affirmative action. Minority <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> who
once might have been admitted to the system's best <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> are now finding
places at lower-tier <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>. More important, the new dispensation has
encouraged state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">universities</ENAMEX> to step up their efforts to recruit <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> from
low-performing high <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>, often with positive results.

Protests by anti-abortion <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activists</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Villanova University</ENAMEX> convinced former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York</ENAMEX>
Times <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">columnist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anna Quindlen</ENAMEX> to bow out as a commencement <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX>. The

an honorary degree from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catholic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">university</ENAMEX> near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philadelphia</ENAMEX>. Quindlen, a

she didn't want to divert attention from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> on their graduation day.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">protesters</ENAMEX> were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only half</NUMEX>-mollified by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quindlen</ENAMEX>'s gesture: The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of
