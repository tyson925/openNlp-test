<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> reporting of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX> war against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yugoslavia</ENAMEX> reflected mounting
confusion <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> over the way ahead. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prominently</ENAMEX> reported their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX> opposition to the use of ground
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX>, following a meeting in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX> between the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heads</ENAMEX> of
government. The Frankfurter
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Allgemeine Zeitung</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Die Welt</ENAMEX> also reported on their front pages that German
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chancellor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gerhard Schr√∂der</ENAMEX> did not rule out an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX>-proposed bombing pause
in the event of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.N. Security Council</ENAMEX> resolution supporting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G-8</ENAMEX> peace
conditions. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Repubblica of Rome</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Corriere della Sera</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Milan</ENAMEX> both gave front-page treatment
to new peace feelers from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Yugoslav</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Slobodan Milosevic</ENAMEX>. Each said the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Serbs</ENAMEX> are now ready to accept the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G-8</ENAMEX> conditions.

            In
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX>, the liberal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guardian</ENAMEX> led on "stark differences" among the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">allies</ENAMEX> on
war strategy. It said a rift was opening "between the more hawkish governments
in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> and anxious <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">allies</ENAMEX> desperate, for domestic
political reasons, for a diplomatic and political breakthrough." But the
consistently hawkish <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times of London</ENAMEX> led on popular protests in southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Serbia</ENAMEX>
against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milosevic</ENAMEX>'s prosecution of the war. This was clearly intended to
strengthen the case for intensified military action. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> said in
an editorial that "the growing demoralisation of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Serb</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> should be
ammunition reinforcing the case for the immediate use in combat of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Apache attack</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">helicopters</ENAMEX>, as part of a more precise and sophisticated military
strategy to drive <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Serb</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> out of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kosovo</ENAMEX>." Despite <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s
widely reported refusal to rule out the use of ground <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX>
continued to portray him as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wimp</ENAMEX>. "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Leadership</ENAMEX>, for the moment, lies with
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX>," it said.

            In the
Daily <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Telegraph</ENAMEX> , another hawkish conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX>, political
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">commentator Boris Johnson</ENAMEX> wrote <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> on the op-ed page that all the talk
of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prime Minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tony Blair</ENAMEX> as "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blair</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hawk</ENAMEX>" was "a gigantic
candyfloss illusion" created by his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Downing Street</ENAMEX> spin <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX>. "We are now in
the blame game," he wrote, "and Mr <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blair</ENAMEX> is simply positioning himself." <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blair</ENAMEX>
has never publicly spoken out in favor of an invasion of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kosovo</ENAMEX> but, thanks to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">media</ENAMEX> manipulation, he is now in a "win-win" situation. "If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX> does prevail,
and every single <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Serb</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldier</ENAMEX> is driven from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kosovo</ENAMEX>, and every last <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">refugee</ENAMEX> is
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">repatriated</ENAMEX>, then <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blair</ENAMEX>'s brows will be crowned with the laurels owed to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who urged the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alliance</ENAMEX> on," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX> wrote. "[A]nd if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX> fails, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blair</ENAMEX> will
be able to blame the flaccidity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>, and of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Draft Dodger</ENAMEX> in
particular."

            
According to a report from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jerusalem Post</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinton</ENAMEX>
administration is "quietly euphoric" about the election of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Labor Party</ENAMEX> leader
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ehud Barak</ENAMEX> as the new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prime minister</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX>. There was some euphoria in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, too. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung</ENAMEX> splashed the headline
"<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barak</ENAMEX> Promises <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rapid Progress</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Middle East Peace Process</ENAMEX>," and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Die</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Welt</ENAMEX> said that his election "arouses new hope worldwide for peace." In
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Le Monde</ENAMEX> 's
headline was "<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX>: A Massive Vote for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peace</ENAMEX>," and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Le Figaro 's</ENAMEX> said "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barak</ENAMEX>
Wants <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">To Relaunch the Peace</ENAMEX>." <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Le Monde</ENAMEX> , in an editorial titled "<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX>:
The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Good News</ENAMEX>," said there are now grounds for hope. But in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>, there was
more skepticism. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daily Telegraph</ENAMEX> , for example, said in an editorial
that the election was not "a referendum on peace." It was "a personal,
bare-knuckled contest, fought and lost on the banalities of local politics."
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> said there can now be progress toward peace, "but only if all
sides are willing to subordinate rhetoric to realism." The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guardian</ENAMEX> said
that if <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barak</ENAMEX> can't deliver peace, who can? If he can't, "the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prospects</ENAMEX> are
grim."

            
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Benjamin Netanyahu</ENAMEX> got bad press practically everywhere. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ha'aretz</ENAMEX> said in its
editorial <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> that he and "the recalcitrant political
fringes to which he was captive" had effectively frozen the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oslo</ENAMEX> agreements but
that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barak</ENAMEX> "now has a renewed opportunity to make peace with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Palestinians</ENAMEX>
and to attain a real peace with all our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX>, with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Syria</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX>." The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jerusalem Post</ENAMEX> 's editorial said, however, that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barak</ENAMEX>'s landslide "was not
only a function of his opponent's failures, but of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Netanyahu</ENAMEX>'s success." The
paper said, "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Netanyahu</ENAMEX> came into office as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> of the opposition to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oslo</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Accords</ENAMEX>; he is leaving having brought the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Likud</ENAMEX> solidly and irreversibly into
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oslo</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camp</ENAMEX>. By resolving the peace-and-security debate in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oslo</ENAMEX>'s favor,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Netanyahu</ENAMEX> made himself obsolete and broke the historic deadlock over the peace
process."

            The
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> world's reaction to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barak</ENAMEX>'s victory was generally suspicious. An editorial
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Syrian</ENAMEX> state-controlled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tashrin</ENAMEX> called the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Netanyahu</ENAMEX>
regime a "<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three-year</TIMEX> nightmare" and said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barak</ENAMEX> should "make drastic changes in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX>'s positions regarding a full withdrawal from occupied <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> lands and a
just and inclusive peace based on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.N.</ENAMEX> resolutions." The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Syria</ENAMEX> Times
expressed some optimism, but the main thrust of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> press comment was
negative. A number of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">columnists</ENAMEX> argued that while <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Netanyahu</ENAMEX> alienated the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX> with his behavior, the "peace-loving" label that has already been
attached to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barak</ENAMEX>--even though he has done nothing yet to earn it--might allow
him to pursue much the same policies while retaining Western support.

            The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palestinian Pan</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">daily</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al-Quds al-Arabi</ENAMEX> went so far as to suggest that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> might
yet come when <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Palestinians</ENAMEX> will look back on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the days</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Netanyahu</ENAMEX> with
something approaching nostalgia. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Saudi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">daily</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Asharq al-Awsat</ENAMEX> said it
feared that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barak</ENAMEX> might prove to be an even bigger headache for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arabs</ENAMEX> than
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Netanyahu</ENAMEX>, for he will pursue much the same hard-line policies as his
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">predecessor</ENAMEX>, but with Western backing. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jordanian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commentator</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fakhri Ka</ENAMEX>'war
accused state-controlled <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> of having lulled <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> into the delusion
that the only obstacle to the peace process was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Netanyahu</ENAMEX>, and that if <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barak</ENAMEX>
won the elections he would prove to be "the great <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">savior</ENAMEX> who rids the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Palestinian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of their ordeal." But he wrote in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amman</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al-Ra</ENAMEX>'i that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arabs</ENAMEX> have learned from bitter experience that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Labor</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Likud</ENAMEX> agree on essentials, share the same expansionist and hegemonic
agenda, and differ only in style. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">daily</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al-Khaleej</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Emirates</ENAMEX> also wondered whether anything has really changed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX>.
"<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barak</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pianist</ENAMEX> has already started playing out of tune," it said. "And if
he finds anyone among us to sing along with him, then we can bid what remains
of peace <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one thousand</NUMEX> good-byes."
