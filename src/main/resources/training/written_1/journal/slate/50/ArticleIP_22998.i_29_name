            According to the voice on
the radio, we should all be worried about "compulsive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gamblers</ENAMEX>" who spend
several <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours a day</TIMEX> playing slot machines. I can't figure out what the voice
was thinking. Nobody who spends <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">several hours a day</TIMEX> playing slot machines can
be called a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gambler</ENAMEX>. Gambling is about risk and uncertainty. Sit long enough in
front of the slots, and you'll lose your money at an entirely predictable rate.
That's the very opposite of gambling.

            Here's what a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gambler</ENAMEX>
does: He takes a large fraction of what he's got and risks it on a single spin
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">wheels</ENAMEX>. You don't see much of that in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">casinos</ENAMEX>. Instead, you see
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX> lugging around buckets filled with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">quarters</TIMEX>, parceling those <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">quarters</ENAMEX> out
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> at a time. There's a name for that strategy: It's called diversification,
and its purpose is to eliminate risk. The more time these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> spend at the
slot machines, the less they're gambling.

            Now, I'm willing to believe this behavior can become
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">compulsive</ENAMEX>, but there are still distinctions worth maintaining. These people
aren't addicted to gambling. They're addicted to sitting in front of slot
machines.

            Likewise, I'm not
addicted to shopping; I'm addicted to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eBay</ENAMEX>--the hottest auction site on the
Internet. I know this because my bidding strategy, which would appear insane to
any casual but thoughtful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observer</ENAMEX>, makes sense only in the presence of a
compulsion to spend as much time as possible monitoring my auctions.

            Most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eBay</ENAMEX> items are sold in "<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>-bid" auctions, which
means the high <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bidder</ENAMEX> gets the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">item</ENAMEX> and pays the amount of the second-highest
bid (I've left out a few complications that can be ignored here). Ordinarily,
there is only one sensible strategy in a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>-bid auction: Bid the highest
amount you'd be willing to pay; then sit back and wait to see if you've
won.

            In a standard English
auction, where the high <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bidder</ENAMEX> pays his own bid, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bidders</ENAMEX> usually try to
"lowball"--that is, to bid less than they're willing to pay, in the hope of
walking away with a bargain. But there's no reason to lowball in a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>-bid
auction, because the amount you pay is independent of the amount you bid. If
the antique royal blue <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pitcher</ENAMEX> is worth <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$300</NUMEX> to me, I should bid <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$300</NUMEX>,
not <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$250</NUMEX>. (If you're not convinced, click for a detailed explanation.)

            Moreover, the same reasoning says that it makes not a shred
of difference whether I bid early or late. So, why do I repeatedly find myself
bidding furiously in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the last five minutes</TIMEX> of an auction and submitting three
different bids in succession when one should suffice? Either I'm behaving
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">irrationally</ENAMEX> or my analysis of bidding strategy contains an invalid assumption.
For that, there are several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX>.

            First, I assumed that I
start off knowing what I'm willing to pay for the water <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pitcher</ENAMEX>. But maybe
that's wrong. Maybe I learn what I'm willing to pay by observing the
progress of the auction. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eBay</ENAMEX> lets me observe the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bidders</ENAMEX>, the
identity of the highest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bidder</ENAMEX> (so far), and the amount of the second-highest
bid (so far). When <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bidders</ENAMEX> jump in, or when a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bidder</ENAMEX> I respect moves out
in front of the pack, I might revise my valuation and submit a new bid.

            Of course, that explanation works only if I care about the
other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bidders</ENAMEX>' opinions--say, because I think they know more than I do or
because I'm trying to predict what kind of resale market I might face someday.
For me, though, the resale market is irrelevant; I never resell anything,
thanks to the same obsessive traits that keep me on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eBay</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> place.
(On the other hand, maybe I do care about resale prices, because I like knowing
that my possessions inspire envy.)

            If I can learn from other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bidders</ENAMEX>, then they can
learn from me--which is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> reason I might want to deviate from a
simplistic "bid and wait" strategy. I bid low at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> to convince my
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">competitors</ENAMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">item</ENAMEX> isn't worth much. Then I jump in with a higher bid at
the end, hoping that at least some of those <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">competitors</ENAMEX> are away from their
computers and unable to respond.

            So, bidding should be
leisurely when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bidders</ENAMEX> have little to learn from each other (say, when they're
bidding on a new computer that's been widely reviewed) and intense when some
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bidders</ENAMEX> are far more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX> than others (say, when they're bidding on a heart
defibrillator for home use). That's a nice testable hypothesis. Unfortunately,
it seems to have failed its first test. When one of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> used <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eBay</ENAMEX> to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sell</ENAMEX> an outrageously expensive (i.e., over <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1,000</NUMEX>) bottle of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bordeaux</ENAMEX> wine,
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bidders</ENAMEX> submitted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> different bids in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first three days</TIMEX>. Now, if
somebody is willing to pay <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1,000</NUMEX> for a bottle of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX>, I'm inclined to guess
that he's well informed about its quality. So why are these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> revising
their bids?

            Maybe they're just addicted to bidding. Maybe I am too.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last week</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eBay</ENAMEX> listed a collectible <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">knife</ENAMEX> with which I am entirely familiar. I
bid <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$225</NUMEX>, which exhausted my willingness to pay. But in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the final five minutes</TIMEX>,
I raised my bid to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$250</NUMEX>, then <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$275</NUMEX>, then <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$300</NUMEX>, and finally won the auction,
exhilarated by my victory.

            Maybe <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eBay</ENAMEX> just makes me giddy. As a free market
aficionado, I am intoxicated by the prospect of one-stop shopping for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Beanie Babies</ENAMEX>, and underwear, all at prices that adjust instantly to the
demands of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> around the globe. Or maybe the behavior of eBayers can be
explained only by subtler and more carefully tested theories that have not yet
been devised. Given the mountain of data being generated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eBay</ENAMEX>, I suspect
those theories will be the stuff of doctoral <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">theses</ENAMEX> for a long time to
come.
