<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pesca's Nominal Torment Wrap-Up</ENAMEX>
            

            I have noticed that nearly every <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-syllable first
name is a homonym for an actual word. (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeff</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clyde</ENAMEX> being
exceptions--and therefore unfortunately discriminated against during Zoom
casting calls.) If my name were the translation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pesca</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Fish</ENAMEX>) it would be
punnable but would preclude my moving to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX>.

            I have long maintained that in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the '70s</TIMEX> and early
'80s the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yankees</ENAMEX> acquired and promoted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">players</ENAMEX> based on how their names worked
in headlines. How else to explain the mysterious presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oscar Gamble</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mickey Rivers</ENAMEX>?

            All the world's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Jacksons</ENAMEX> (like the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indians</ENAMEX>'
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">reliever</ENAMEX>) now go by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike</ENAMEX>, simply because of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> androgynously desiccated freak.
The exception is beer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Jackson</ENAMEX>, the explanation being <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) he had
the name <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) he's too drunk to realize; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) no one would mistake a fat
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pretentious</ENAMEX> hop-head for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX> of pop.

            For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past few years</TIMEX> I have gauged the popularity
of hockey by the fact that no one has linked my name to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike Peca</ENAMEX> ,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">captain</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Buffalo Sabres</ENAMEX>. This may speak more to the popularity of all
things <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Buffalo</ENAMEX>, but now that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sabes</ENAMEX> are in the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">cup</ENAMEX> final, I still expect no
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to mention it. But maybe I'll catch a double take if I'm ever in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Niagara Falls</ENAMEX> region.

            If this miraculous
phrase to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pesca</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> becomes ubiquitous, I will join the ranks of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">punnable</ENAMEX> and will forever be able to step forth from the shadows of my maternal
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ancestors Philip</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sylvia Lipshitz</ENAMEX>.

            Here's how <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry Rohter</ENAMEX> describes it in the New
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">York Times</ENAMEX> : "A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">band</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guerrillas</ENAMEX> appears out of nowhere, sets up a
roadblock on a main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">highway</ENAMEX>, stops every <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bus</ENAMEX> that happens along, takes
away all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> who seem likely to have a good job or a prominent name,
and holds them captive until a hefty ransom is paid."

            The practice takes its name from a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Colombian</ENAMEX> party
