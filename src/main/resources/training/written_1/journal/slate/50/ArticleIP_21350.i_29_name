            I said, "Dear <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry</ENAMEX>," as I put down his book,
Elegy ,

            across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> from
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Home Energy Center</ENAMEX>

            and its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> embellished secular <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>

            and its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> red wreaths
over red ribbon crosses

            enshrining a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> inch stove in one of its
windows

            and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a fifty gallon</NUMEX> water
heater in the other,

            knowing how wise he would have been with the parking
lot

            and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> that refused
against all odds and all

            sane agreements and codicils to let its dead
leaves

            for God's sake fall in
some kind of trivial decency

            and how he would have stopped with me always beside
him

            to watch a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> in a
white fur parka and boots

            build the first snowball on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Northampton Street</ENAMEX> she
collected

            from the hood of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX>
Fairlane underneath that tree

            and throw it she thought at a small speed limit
sign

            although it landed with a
fluff just shy of the twin

            painted center lines inducing the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of us,

            her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lover</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry</ENAMEX>, and I
to make our own snowballs

            from the hoods and fenders of our own Fairlanes
although

            she threw like none of us
and to add to it

            she was left-handed, so bless her, may she have

            a good job and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
and always be free of cancer

            and may the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of us scrape some roofs before
the

            rain relieves us, and may we find gloves for our
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">labor</ENAMEX>.
