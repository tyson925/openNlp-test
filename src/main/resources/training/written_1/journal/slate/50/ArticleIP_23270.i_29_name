                  The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Matrix</ENAMEX>
                (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner Bros.</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keanu Reeves</ENAMEX> stars in this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>,
dystopic sci-fi thriller. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Critics</ENAMEX> give high marks to the computer-enhanced
special effects but are divided on the merits of the ambitious plot and the
everything-but-the-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">kichen</NUMEX>-sink filmic provenance, from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Soylent Green</ENAMEX> to
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Terminator 2</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> actioners. For some the effects are enough:
It's "<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> big, fat, honking comic book of a sci-fi-martial-arts adventure
flick. ... It has stu-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">freakin</ENAMEX>'-pendous special effects, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hipster</ENAMEX> sang-froid out
the wazoo and a story line that makes only as much sense as it has to" (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michael</ENAMEX>
O'Sullivan, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> ). A grudgingly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">appreciative</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Janet Maslin</ENAMEX>
says that at its best the movie brings "<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> action style home to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audiences</ENAMEX> in a mainstream <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> adventure with big prospects as a cult
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">classic</ENAMEX> and with the future very much in mind" (the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> ).
Others criticize the convoluted story line and call it strictly genre and
strictly for "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> in their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teens</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">20s</ENAMEX>, for whom the script's pretentious
mumbo-jumbo of undergraduate mythology, religious mysticism and technobabble
could even be a plus rather than a dramatic liability" (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Todd McCarthy</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daily</ENAMEX>
Variety ). (To see the trailer and some fine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Keanu pics</ENAMEX>, visit this fan

                  10 Things I
Hate <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">About You</ENAMEX>
                (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buena Vista Pictures</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Critics</ENAMEX>, many of whom
admitted they had been gearing up for "<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> things I hate about this movie"
reviews, are charmed, if not in love with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare</ENAMEX> offering.
(The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">source</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Taming of the Shrew</ENAMEX> .) Entertainment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Weekly</ENAMEX> 's
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Owen Gleiberman</ENAMEX> writes it "may be the cheekiest 'literary' update yet--a
post-riot <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grrrl</ENAMEX> gloss" of the play. Many gush over the foxy young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">star</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Julia</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stiles</ENAMEX>. Complaints are mainly a result of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX>'
upscale-high-school-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">caper</NUMEX>-film fatigue. A few find the film irritating:
Daily <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Variety</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dennis Harvey</ENAMEX> says, "it lurches all over the map,
encompassing dialogue both inspired and juvenile." (Visit the

                  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cookie</ENAMEX>'s
Fortune
                (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">October Films</ENAMEX>). Critical response to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Robert Altman</ENAMEX>'s
warm 'n' fuzzy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern Gothic</ENAMEX> tale covers the spectrum. Most are tickled pink:
"a small miracle" with "an irresistibly companionable spirit" (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Denby</ENAMEX>,
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Yorker</ENAMEX> ). The classic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Altman</ENAMEX> deep bench (including <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Patricia Neal</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glenn Close</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Julianne Moore</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chris O'Donnell</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liv Tyler</ENAMEX>) does not
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">disappoint</ENAMEX>, and most play twinklingly kooky oddballs. However, several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX>
are not so keen. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">More than one</NUMEX> call it "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Altman</ENAMEX> lite" (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Mathews</ENAMEX>, the
Daily <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News</ENAMEX> ) and say "[t]he fabled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Altman</ENAMEX> atmosphere fails to jell"
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gleiberman, Entertainment Weekly</ENAMEX> ). A small cadre is seriously
disappointed: "another footnote to an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Altman</ENAMEX> career that is fast becoming all
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">footnotes"</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Corliss</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> ) or, more simply, "[h]e falters again"
(<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stanley Kauffmann</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Republic</ENAMEX> ). (For more on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Robert</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Altman</ENAMEX>, visit this site, which has links to interviews and essays about him, and
read <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edelstein</ENAMEX>'s review <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX> in 
                  Slate
               .)

            
               
                  A Walk on
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moon</ENAMEX>
                (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Miramax Films</ENAMEX>). Mixed reviews, tending toward the
negative, for this tale of sexual liberation set in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1969</TIMEX>. A <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">housewife</ENAMEX> who married too young is on vacation in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catskills</ENAMEX> with her two
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother-in-law</ENAMEX> when she meets a sexy, young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blouse peddler</ENAMEX>. The rest?
As the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicago Sun-Times</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger Ebert</ENAMEX> says, it's "<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> small step for the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blouse Man</ENAMEX>, a giant leap for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pearl Kantrowitz</ENAMEX>." <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Corliss</ENAMEX> writes
that the film's nice, if "you look past the gaffes and clich√©s." On the
positive side, most say the acting is great, and though the film "doesn't take
enormous chances," it is nevertheless "extremely satisfying" (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Denby</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The New</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yorker</ENAMEX> ). 
                  Slate
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">'s Edelstein</ENAMEX> is more positive than
most, praising the "deliciously resonant dual setting: a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catskills</ENAMEX> summer
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">community</ENAMEX> to which middle-class <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> migrate to swim and eat and
play mah-jongg, and the gathering hippies at nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Woodstock</ENAMEX>." ( the rest of
his review.)

            
               
                  The
Out-of-Towners
                (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paramount Pictures</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goldie Hawn</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Martin</ENAMEX>
star in a remake of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neil Simon</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1970</TIMEX> film that's "so feeble and unfocussed as
to make the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Farrelly</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brothers</ENAMEX> of There's <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Something About Mary</ENAMEX> appear to
have suckled at the bosom of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aristophanes</ENAMEX>" (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawrence Van Gelder</ENAMEX>, the New
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">York Times</ENAMEX> ). All <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> agree; few put it so well. The plot: A nice
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Midwestern</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> goes through the wringer in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manhattan</ENAMEX> (lost luggage,
muggings, etc). The film's only breath of fresh air is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Cleese</ENAMEX>, who plays a
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">snobby</ENAMEX> hotel <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX>, recycling <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Basil Fawlty</ENAMEX> to good effect. (For more on

                  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morgan</ENAMEX>:
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Financier</ENAMEX>
               , by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jean Strouse</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Random House</ENAMEX>). Excellent
reviews for this doorstop-sized biography on the legendary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">financier</ENAMEX>: "a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">magnificent</ENAMEX>, insightful study" (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maury Klein</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> ).
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Reviewers</ENAMEX> are impressed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Strouse</ENAMEX>'s extensive research, which turned up a
truckload of new details on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morgan</ENAMEX>'s life and, more importantly, by the
balanced portrait that she provides of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> whose biographies have to date
been colored by vindictive accounts from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contemporaries</ENAMEX> with axes to grind. The
strongest negative comment comes from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times Book Review</ENAMEX> ,
which warns that "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> without an interest in business and financial history
may find some of this material wearisome" (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Lingeman</ENAMEX>). (To buy the book

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX>). Decent reviews for former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Max</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frankel</ENAMEX>'s memoirs: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ward</ENAMEX> Just calls it a "a smart, tough, scrupulous book" in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times Book Review</ENAMEX> ; in that fair <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journal</ENAMEX>'s traditional
negative-comment spot (the penultimate paragraph) all Just can come up with is
that there's "a whiff of the puritan about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Max Frankel</ENAMEX>, and perhaps also the
rustle of score-settling." Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reviewers</ENAMEX> note that his personal life--if you
can even say he had one--gets short shrift, and most say <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frankel</ENAMEX>'s time at the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">helm</ENAMEX> is not <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> as interesting as his flight from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> in his childhood and
his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> as a young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">correspondent</ENAMEX>. Perhaps the best backhanded compliment is
provided by another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> review, this one from the daily
paper: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Kluger</ENAMEX> writes that the book has "only occasional spasms of the
immodesty that almost by definition infects all who venture into
autobiography." (To buy the book click here.)
