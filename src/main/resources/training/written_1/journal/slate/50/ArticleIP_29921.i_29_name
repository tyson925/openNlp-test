            A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> of mine offers a theory about why <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bill</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s poll numbers stayed so high throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX> scandal: The news
made it possible for serious-minded <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to spend lots of time--at the office
and over lunch--talking about semen stains, vaginal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">insertions</ENAMEX>, and blow jobs.
And the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> were grateful.

            That's probably because they're not getting all
that much themselves. A recent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Chicago</ENAMEX> survey of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>
found that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> are having considerably less sex than was generally
thought. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> has sex <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times a week. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> didn't
score at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all last year</TIMEX>.

            If that's true, many of us could use a little
sexual self-improvement. Not me, of course. I have been happily married for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the age of 21</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deb</ENAMEX> and I have what seems to us to be a perfectly
fine amorous life, yet everywhere I turn the culture tells me--almost mocks
me-- you can do better! What would happen to our sex life then, if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deb</ENAMEX>
(who participated in this story because she loves me and because she has
tenure) and I tried for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time to make something happen to it?

            And so it was that we
found ourselves for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time ever in a sex-toy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A Touch of Romance</ENAMEX>,
located near our home in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>, across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> from a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macy's</ENAMEX>. The idea
behind <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> like these is to make obtaining the materials of sexual
experimentation as ordinary as purchasing plumbing supplies or housewares.

            Which sort of works--the only sexual thrill I got from the
visit was knowing that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> just bought a cock ring. Choosing it wasn't
easy. Most of them came in presized sets of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>. I couldn't figure out which
would fit right and intuited that try-ons weren't an option. So I opted instead
for an adjustable circumference version, a little strip of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vinyl</ENAMEX> with snaps for
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$11.95</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Man</ENAMEX>, what a rip-off! Unless it works.

            It doesn't. Back home, I derived a certain depraved
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">buzz</ENAMEX> in cinching the device on, but that was soon eclipsed. The thing works on
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Roach Motel</ENAMEX> principle--your <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> gets in but it can't get out. But then I
got to thinking: Under battlefield conditions it doesn't get out anyway. And
while I should have been paying more attention to other things, this led to
thinking about the old joke with the punch line "... and right ball go POW." My
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> hadn't noticed any difference at all.

            A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> I know says <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazines</ENAMEX> are the best places
in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> to find sex tips. She's right--go ahead, just try to find a sewing
pattern in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Redbook</ENAMEX> . You're much more likely to land on "Try phone sex,
dirty notes, porn videos, fantasy games and sex in new places. ... Try lingerie
and no underwear. ... Try talking dirty and silk scarves. Try anything at all,"
or articles such as "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Eight New Games for the Foreplay Challenged</ENAMEX>."

            An article in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cosmopolitan</ENAMEX> , "The
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Best Sex Positions</ENAMEX>," seemed more promising than the Redbook
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">playbook</ENAMEX>. Each position was accompanied by a succinct write-up and a
stick-figure diagram. The position we settled on was "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Butterfly</ENAMEX>," which we
had to read <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times to comprehend. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> stands, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> remains supine
on a bed or counter-top with her feet up on his shoulders. The whole idea is to
produce a pelvic tilt for better access to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> spot. Instead, we experienced
an uncomfortable pretzel feeling that stick figures must be immune to. And in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">general</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cosmopolitan</ENAMEX> 's exotic sex <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">positions</ENAMEX> require the sort of body
placement you can't remember in the moment of passion and even if you could,
for proper alignment, you still might need mood-killing accessories such as a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">plumb</ENAMEX> line and a laser pen.

            Next we tried those "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Better Sex</ENAMEX>" instructional videos
advertised in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> 
               Book <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Review</ENAMEX>. I ordered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Better</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Sexual Techniques , Advanced Sexual Techniques , Making Sex</ENAMEX>
Fun , and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Advanced Oral Sex Techniques</ENAMEX> (priced <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $11.95</NUMEX> each, not
including shipping and handling). My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> couldn't bear to watch them; I
persevered but must admit it was a chore. The oral-sex tape starts with
"well-known sex therapist" <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diana Wiley</ENAMEX>, in her poofy hair and broad-shouldered
blue power suit, looking like she was about to explain how the sales force
could increase its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> productivity. Instead she runs through all the
euphemisms for oral sex and then the video cuts to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XXX</ENAMEX> action with gratuitous
commentary.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wiley</ENAMEX>'s overexplanation of everything <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> can
do to each other with their mouths raises this question: Do you really need a
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five-minute</TIMEX> video <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> on whether or not to swallow? In the great tradition
of hotel and travel ads, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> tend to be markedly less attractive than the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. No way he'd be with her if this wasn't an instructional sex video! The
inanity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> and the dubious casting make these films about as erotic
as ... well, as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> . You could learn more from any
randomly selected porn video.

            Another approach is food. The notion that certain foods,
such as oysters or <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rhino horn</ENAMEX>, are aphrodisiacs has been pretty much
discounted. But it's plausible to think that cooking a meal together and then
dining on it, just the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of you, could be erotic. Especially if (like me)
your schedule frequently forces you to eat alone and you often find yourself
standing in front of the microwave, screaming, "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Come on</ENAMEX>, goddammit!"
Intercourses , by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martha Hopkins</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Randall Lockridge</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$24.95</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Terrace</ENAMEX>
Publishing, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>), preaches that for every time of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX> and every phase of a
relationship there is a type of eating experience that will heighten sexual
response. (There's also a chart showing which <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX> are good for eating off
which body parts.) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deb</ENAMEX> and I blocked off a whole <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</TIMEX>
for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Intercourses</ENAMEX> experiment, settling on rosemary-scented <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lamb</ENAMEX> over
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pasta</ENAMEX> (Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">87</NUMEX>) followed by frozen <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee almond dessert</ENAMEX> (Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX>). According
to the book, rosemary is sexy because of its fragrance (used in many perfumes)
and because of its texture, which, so the text assured, tickles nerve endings.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dessert</ENAMEX> was mostly <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rum</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kahlua</ENAMEX>, which has worked before.

            We shopped for the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> together and cooked
together, drinking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beer</ENAMEX> along the way. At <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> point while I was
working on the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dessert</ENAMEX>, I asked my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> how long to beat the heavy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cream</ENAMEX>
mixture. "Till it's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stiff</ENAMEX>--it's an aphrodisiac," she said. Preparation took
less than <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an hour</TIMEX>, and everything came out perfectly. Eating at our dining room
table for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time ever without <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guests</ENAMEX>, we were having fun by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">candlelight</ENAMEX>. But the mood was romantic, not erotic.

            That's when we went for the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Viagra</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$212.50</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> doses,
which includes a "consultation" fee). The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> was prescribed by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX>, whom
I've never met, and ordered from a pharmacy in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Miami Beach</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fla.</ENAMEX>, where I've
never been. I completed the transaction via the Internet after filling out a
cover-their-ass questionnaire in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three minutes</TIMEX>.

            We each decided to take <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pill</ENAMEX>, clinked our
glasses, and gulped. And then what? It felt awkward sitting in our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedroom</ENAMEX>,
knowing that it could take up to an hour for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Viagra</ENAMEX> to "work." I suggested that
we play <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">strip poker</ENAMEX>, something I'd never done. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deb</ENAMEX> had never even played <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">poker</ENAMEX>,
so I had to explain the rules. I won in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about six</NUMEX> hands, auspiciously I
thought, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> aces. But we still weren't really in the mood yet.

            So then I got out the other purchase I'd made at A
Touch of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Romance--"Dirty Dice"</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$4.95</NUMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the two pink cubes is marked
with these words instead of dots: "lips," "above waist," "ear," "breast,"
"below waist," and "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">?</ENAMEX>". The other cube is labeled "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">kiss</ENAMEX>," "squeeze," "lick,"
"blow," "suck," and "eat." We took turns throwing the dice, but the activities
generated seemed forced and arbitrary. Finally, as they say at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX>, there was
word from the pad that the launch sequence was initiating. It was pretty much
like all other sex, except for a slight lightheadedness. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deb</ENAMEX> said she noticed a
remote tingling sensation. On the plus side, there was no priapism and neither
of us experienced disruption of our color vision nor a fatal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart attack</ENAMEX>,
which was nice.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Augustine</ENAMEX> held lust to be a fitting punishment for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">man</ENAMEX>'s disobedience to God: the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>'s disobeying of the mind, the will, the
spirit, and even of itself. (The paradigm of this for him is the unbidden
hard-on.) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jean-Paul Sartre</ENAMEX> discovered something similar, although celebrating
it rather than deploring it: Essential to the erotic is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>'s defiance
of design and control. (The paradigm of this for him is the jiggle.)
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sartre</ENAMEX>'s view yields a sort of sexual Heisenberg principle: There is an
inherent tension between physically abandoning yourself to another on the one
hand and sexual planning on the other. The more of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>, the less of the
other. And this, I discovered, is the chief obstacle to sexual self-help.
Getting an erection is sexy. Making one is not. As my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> said about <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Viagra</ENAMEX>,
"You start to have a new feeling and then you realize where it came from and
then you don't have it so much. ... Anything that makes you think about it like
that is just creepy."

            This is not to say there isn't a way out of this
conflict between desire and design. With homage to our potent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">POTUS</ENAMEX>, there is,
I think, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Third Way</ENAMEX> that's neither sexual complacency nor standard self-help.
If the intrusion of consciousness is the problem, then maybe the answer is to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">block</ENAMEX> it out. Sure, you could do this the old-fashioned way: with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>. But then you have all the traditional drawbacks, including diminished
physical attractiveness and degraded sexual performance.

            So how about this instead? Go for all the sexual
self-help you can, but do it covertly . Watch a sex video (or porn flick)
if you want--but by yourself, and then try to share what you learned without
sharing how you learned it. Don't tell your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> you took <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Viagra</ENAMEX>. Or give
each other standing permission to slip it into the odd after-dinner <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drink</ENAMEX>,
saying nothing. (Of course, when you do it you'll still know, but having an
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unselfconsciously</ENAMEX> turned-on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> is a real compensation for that, and next
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>, your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> can surprise you. And yes, this requires <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">trust</ENAMEX>. But why
would you be having sex with someone you don't trust?) My main conclusion is
that contrary to our blabby culture, the key to a better sex life is less
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">communication</ENAMEX>.
