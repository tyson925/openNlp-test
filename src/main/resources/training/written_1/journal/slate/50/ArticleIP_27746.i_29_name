   
   
      
         
            That's a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wrap</ENAMEX>!

            If the rowdy and facetious new film The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mummy</ENAMEX> suggests anything, it's that we've come to what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis Fukuyama</ENAMEX>
might call "the end of horror movies." The horror genre lost its life's blood
when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">filmmakers</ENAMEX> began to worry about being laughed at by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teen-agers</ENAMEX> who'd seen
it all before, and to incorporate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>' imagined responses into their
pictures--so that you got the movie and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mystery Science</ENAMEX> 
               Theater
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3000</TIMEX> burlesque of the movie at the same time. Forget about the vague fear
of the nameless, otherwise known as "dread." Forget about awe, too, unless it's
short for "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Awesome</ENAMEX>, dude!" in response to some pricey special effect. Bring on
the ironic one-liners and the slapstick ghoul-bashing kung fu--and let's
party!

            Postmodern jokiness can only undermine the mummy
subgenre, which has at its heart the most ancient of scary ideas: If you
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">presume</ENAMEX> to violate an alien culture and make off with its sacred objects,
you're going to be visited by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">monster</ENAMEX> that's beyond the power of your own
culture to combat. There's a big dollop of xenophobia here--old mummy pictures
are full of stilted <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actors</ENAMEX> pretending to be icily vengeful
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Egyptians</ENAMEX>--but there's also a less chauvinistic implication: a rebuke to our
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Western</ENAMEX>-imperialist sense of entitlement. For all its nonsensical trappings,
the mummy narrative is serious business, because when other peoples'
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">passionately</ENAMEX> held taboos are casually flouted it is serious business.
Just ask <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salman Rushdie</ENAMEX>. The invasion of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mummy</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tomb</ENAMEX> results in a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fatwa</ENAMEX> made flesh--or, if not flesh, then bandages and bones rendered
really really nasty by righteous wrath.

            Some of these ideas can
be found in the new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">The Mummy</ENAMEX> , but they have been stripped of their
weight and cultural resonance. In their place is a lot of sub- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Raiders</ENAMEX> of the
Lost <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ark</ENAMEX> swashbuckling, plus sight gags pilfered from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam Raimi</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>
Army of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Darkness</ENAMEX> (the last of his <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Evil Dead trilogy</ENAMEX>) and
genre-deflating banter that's like an untalented sophomore's stab at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Butch</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cassidy</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Sundance Kid</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1969</TIMEX>). (The juvenile script is by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Sommers</ENAMEX>.) There isn't a mummy at the center of The
Mummy , exactly, but a mutating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Industrial Light</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Magic Special Effect</ENAMEX>.
Under it, supposedly, is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Imhotep</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arnold Vosloo</ENAMEX>), an ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priest</ENAMEX>
discovered--in the movie's prologue--in a compromising position with the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pharaoh</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mistress</ENAMEX>, who kills herself in an act of feminist defiance. ("My body
is no longer his temple!")

            When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Imhotep</ENAMEX> goes to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hamunaptra</ENAMEX>--the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">City of the Dead</ENAMEX>--to
revive her, he is stopped by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pharoah</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guards</ENAMEX>, shorn of his tongue, then
wrapped in gauze and buried alive with a swarm of scabrous beetles. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Legend</ENAMEX> has
it that if he's ever revived, he'll visit the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> plagues of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> upon the
world. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Legend</ENAMEX> has it right, as it turns out, but it's a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">long hour</TIMEX> before
roguish adventurer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brendan Fraser</ENAMEX> can transport <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">dimwitted</ENAMEX> 1920s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pandora</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heroine</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rachel Weisz</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hamunaptra</ENAMEX> so that she can open the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Book of the Dead</ENAMEX> and start
stupidly incanting. It takes <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">another hour</TIMEX> to search for the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Book of the Dead</ENAMEX>'s
opposite number, which will theoretically send <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Imhotep</ENAMEX> back to the cosmic soup
from which he sprang before he can transfer the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heroine</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soul</ENAMEX> to the embalmed
remains of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX> love.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Special Effect</ENAMEX> (a k a
the mummy) reminded me of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Ghost of Christmas Future</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Murray</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">comedy Scrooged</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX>). It's tall and mottled and has a wiggly mouth
that can suddenly distend itself and emit a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jurassic Park</ENAMEX> -style roar. It
has all manner of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">superpowers</ENAMEX>, turning itself into a puff of smoke, a
<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">hurricane</ENAMEX>, and a swarm of ravenous locusts. It can appropriate pieces of its
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX>' anatomies in an effort to reconstitute itself (an idea cribbed from
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clive Barker's 1987 Hellraiser</ENAMEX> --but less gorily executed, for the sake
of a kiddie-friendly PG-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>). It can also revive its mummified fellow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priests</ENAMEX>
and send them into battle against our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heroes</ENAMEX>. The Special Effect can do almost
anything--except look scary. It's not solely the fault of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Industrial Light</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Magic</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slapstick</ENAMEX> and horror aren't an easy mix. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam Raimi</ENAMEX> might be the only one
who can pull it off--when his spastic, hyperkinetic ghouls come at you they
seem genuinely invasive. The ghouls of lesser <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> just bash into one
another like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keystone Korpses</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> he Mummy isn't as inept as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Godzilla</ENAMEX> --it more or less hits its <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">marks</NUMEX>, and some nonindustry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> at
the preview I attended claimed to have been entertained. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cast</ENAMEX> is certainly
game. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fraser</ENAMEX> has a long, rangy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> and a gee-whiz openness that makes him
perfect for a comic-book <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hero</ENAMEX>, and the lovely <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Weisz</ENAMEX>--whose eyes are so far
apart that they're almost in different time zones--brings a screwball aplomb to
the dizzy distaff <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Egyptologist</ENAMEX>. As her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Hannah</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gwyneth Paltrow</ENAMEX>'s
love-struck <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Scottish</ENAMEX> lapdog in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Sliding Doors</ENAMEX> ) is too
stridently the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Comic Relief</ENAMEX> in a movie in which the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hero</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heroine</ENAMEX> are
already busy comedically relieving themselves, but he's a hard chap to dislike.
The villain is another kettle of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">leeches</ENAMEX>. I adored <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vosloo</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lance Henriksen</ENAMEX>'s
black-garbed, femininely insinuating henchman in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Woo-Jean Claude Van</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Damme</ENAMEX> action picture Hard <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Target</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>). But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vosloo</ENAMEX> doesn't have the
physiognomy for a role incarnated variously by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gaunt</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boris Karloff</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1932</TIMEX>)
and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">totemic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher Lee</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1959</TIMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bald</ENAMEX> and round-headed, he's about as
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">imposing as Curly of the Three Stooges</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> he Mummy is a debauchery but not a true
defilement: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mummy</ENAMEX> movies don't constitute an especially glorious cinematic
legacy. Only the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Karloff</ENAMEX> original, directed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karl Freund</ENAMEX>, qualifies as a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">classic</ENAMEX>, with its sleek <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Egyptian</ENAMEX>-Deco d√©cor and its matchlessly eerie scene of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mummy</ENAMEX>'s awakening. (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bramwell Fletcher</ENAMEX>'s hysterical laughter in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">creature</ENAMEX>'s wake--"<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">He</ENAMEX> went for a little walk!"--echoes in the annals of horror
film history.) Still, I have a soft spot for all those dreary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lon Chaney Jr.</ENAMEX>
sequels that ended with the lurching, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-blind <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">golem</ENAMEX> lugging a slack blonde
through the swamps while <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Zucco</ENAMEX> in a turban hisses something like,
"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Faster, Kharis</ENAMEX>! Before the torch-wielding infidels converge on the sacred tomb
of Ananka!" I can't make a case for the dim <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Hammer Films remakes</ENAMEX>, either,
although it's always fun to watch <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Cushing</ENAMEX> get strangled by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Christopher</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lee</ENAMEX>. No, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sommers</ENAMEX> hasn't blasphemed. He doesn't deserve to have his eyes and
tongue sucked out, his brain dashed against the side of a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tomb</ENAMEX>, or to be
consumed by scarab beetles or flayed by locusts. But he has put another nail in
the horror genre's sarcophagus. He should at least lose a hand.

            In some cultures, they cut off hands (and even more
vital body parts) when they find out you're gay. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven Carter</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ben</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Silverstone</ENAMEX>), the stringy <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hero</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Get Real</ENAMEX> , merely faces
parental disapproval, social ostracization, and a dishy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">jock lover</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brad</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gorton</ENAMEX>) who doesn't want to acknowledge him in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">halls</ENAMEX> of their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">high school</ENAMEX>.
Still, it's enough. The strength of this agreeable comedy, directed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Simon</ENAMEX>
Shore from a screenplay by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Patrick Wilde</ENAMEX>, is that it makes even the tiniest
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sexual</ENAMEX> encounters seem emotionally momentous. They would be anyway, at this
age, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven</ENAMEX> has fewer <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">avenues</ENAMEX> for self-expression than his heterosexual
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">peers</ENAMEX>, and the pressure builds. Despite its gay subject matter, Get Real
is rather wholesome and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">didactic</TIMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven</ENAMEX> writes an essay for the yearbook
called <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">"Get Real</ENAMEX>," and the film climaxes with a speech about wanting to be
recognized and loved for who you really are. There's nothing glib about
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Silverstone</ENAMEX>'s performance, though. At times, he's believably stricken, at
others believably affectless--as if every emotion has been wrapped up so
tightly for fear of discovery that there's no such thing as a "natural"
response. He's in danger of becoming a true mummy.
