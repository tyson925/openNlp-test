Wrap-Up
            

            Let's take a rare glimpse
inside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News Quiz Tower</ENAMEX> (it's not yet killed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as many</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> as that new
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cond√© Nast Building</ENAMEX>, but <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next week</TIMEX> we start heaving copies of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vogue</ENAMEX> off
the observation deck) and learn what it takes to get a hefty <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">400-pound</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">hog</ENAMEX> from
the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">farm</ENAMEX> to your table to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>'s desk where it is signed into law. By
which I mean: How did we select <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s question? By rejecting these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>:

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. "Fill in the blank in
this remark by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Susan Webber Wright</ENAMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> to hold a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> in
contempt of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX>. 'I don't think a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> should be __________. My focus is to
be fair to all sides.' "

            A good way to get at an
important story, but nixed on formal grounds. We ran a fill-in-the-blank just
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX>. We try for variety in form as well as in subject matter.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. "<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charlie</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gonzalez</ENAMEX> said, 'You've seen someone else handle it up close and personal, so
you know you can survive it. It's not so foreign to you.' Handle what?"

            A nice ambiguous remark
that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> would do well with, but it refers to too trivial a story,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> of former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dodd</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kennedy</ENAMEX>--going into the family
business.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. "The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leonardo DiCaprio</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">film The Basketball Diaries</ENAMEX> , the computer game <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mortal Combat</ENAMEX>, and the
Internet sex site <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meow Media</ENAMEX>--what's the connection<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">?</ENAMEX>"

            A pleasing juxtaposition
of elements, and it's sure fun to type out "sex site <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meow Media</ENAMEX>," but rejected
for both form and content. We've used this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> recently, and it's a
lightweight story.

            I began hoping to do
something with either the war or the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>'s contempt citation, and eager
to use "I give the headline; you give the lead," or "I give the answer; you
give the question," or "I give the caption; you describe the photo," <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> nice
forms we've not used lately. But nothing turned up that worked that way. I'm
relieved that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trent Lott</ENAMEX>'s back in town.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jockey Julie Krone</ENAMEX> said it about retiring.

            In her <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18-year</TIMEX> career,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Krone</ENAMEX> won <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,541</NUMEX> races, earned <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">over $80 million</NUMEX> in prize money, and broke more

in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saratoga</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last November</TIMEX>, at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meadowlands</ENAMEX>, she broke her right

               Event

               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beneficiary</ENAMEX>: The rain forest.

            

               Downside: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sting</ENAMEX> is singing tribute to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sinatra</ENAMEX>.

            
               Event: <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Young professionals</ENAMEX> throw

               Downside: <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Open</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX> means <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX>
gooned on margaritas and their own benevolence.

            
               Event: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charlie Rose</ENAMEX> honors

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heritage</ENAMEX>.

            

               Downside: Chance that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O'Connor</ENAMEX> could stop by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cinco de Mayo</ENAMEX>
party on way over, get tanked on margaritas, make <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">crude</ENAMEX> pass at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charlie</ENAMEX>
Rose.

            
               Event: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Martin</ENAMEX> and others read

               Downside: Could be <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the night</TIMEX> God's wrath descends on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rupert</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murdoch</ENAMEX>, killing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of literacy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">volunteers</ENAMEX> in corollary damage from
lightning strike.

            
               Event: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One hundred</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>

meals to the homebound.

            

               Downside: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Overt</ENAMEX> use of phrase "crumbs from rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>'s table"
could cause scores of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diners</ENAMEX> to die of embarrassment.
