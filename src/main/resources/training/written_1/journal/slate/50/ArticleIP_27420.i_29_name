               The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pepsi</ENAMEX>
Generation
            

            Never have I read a more
accurate commentary on high-school social hierarchy than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cyrus Sanai</ENAMEX>'s "." When
I went to high school in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late '80s</TIMEX> we used to have this program called
"All-Star," whose stated purpose was to eliminate cliques and bring the school
together. The program thought it could do this by a) making us watch
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pepsi</ENAMEX>-sponsored movies featuring anti-drug propaganda and shrewd product
placement; b) reinforcing the most obnoxious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cliques</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">campus</ENAMEX> by choosing all
the "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">All Star</ENAMEX>" <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> from a popular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">athletes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cheerleaders</ENAMEX> (on
average, B and C <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> who drank, smoked, and skipped <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX>); c) doing
everything possible to conceal the fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">high school</ENAMEX>'s purpose is
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">education</ENAMEX>; and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">d</ENAMEX>) giving us the opportunity to buy as much "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">All Star</ENAMEX>"
merchandise as our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> could afford. It was insulting and embarrassing and
(thank God) only lasted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few months</TIMEX>.

            Programs like "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">All Star</ENAMEX>"
are colossal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wastes</ENAMEX> of time that make <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teen-agers</ENAMEX> hate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> because they
emphasize exactly what they attempt to eliminate. I hope <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who have kids
in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">high school</ENAMEX> will realize this and will not think that that is enough to end
tragedies like that at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbine</ENAMEX>.

               The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rodriguez</ENAMEX>
"We"
            

            I think <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cyrus Sanai</ENAMEX> missed
the point of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Rodriguez</ENAMEX> essay in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>

               Times <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last Sunday</TIMEX> (see "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Community Kills"</ENAMEX>). When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rodriguez</ENAMEX> talked about
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">community</ENAMEX>, he was not talking about the need for more school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spirit</ENAMEX> or
collective pride in the success of high-school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX>. And he certainly
recognized the social divisions within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> as well (an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">athlete</ENAMEX> who
singled out a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jew</ENAMEX> for being different comes to mind).

            The kind of community he means does not come from
pep rallies or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> washes, but rather from a value system and a curriculum that
teach the common bonds that we as <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> have. Not "celebrations of
multiculturalism," but a history, for example, that connects <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Jefferson</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malcolm X</ENAMEX>, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rodriguez</ENAMEX> writes.

            Also missing, as
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rodriguez</ENAMEX> points out, is any structured <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> or neighborhood in many young
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>'s lives. That is the "we" he is talking about, of belonging to something
and having that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">foundation</ENAMEX> laid prior to going to school and reaching
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adolescence</ENAMEX>. Not living an anonymous life in your <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> or on the Internet. The
lack of these positive networks, he argues, as do others, is why many inner
city <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> look for "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>" in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gangs</ENAMEX>. The lack of strong <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> in too many
young lives makes the public <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>'s job (poorly conceived and performed as
well, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rodriguez</ENAMEX>) of teaching and bringing a sense of connection to
other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>, past and present, nearly impossible. This is a long-term
problem, and he knows it. He is certainly not calling for more cries of "Go
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">team</ENAMEX>!" or "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Beat Northside High</ENAMEX>!"

                  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cyrus Sanai</ENAMEX>
replies: I think <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rodriguez</ENAMEX> is out of touch (maybe quite happily) with life
as it is lived in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbine High Schools of America</ENAMEX>. You can't teach common
bonds of history to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teens</ENAMEX> while the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> stress athletics
as the most honored achievement. In fact, you can't teach them at all; as an
environment for educational and moral growth, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> public secondary
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">education</ENAMEX> will continue to be a miserable failure so long as the values of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">institution</ENAMEX> are so at odds with its ostensible mission. (Only the better
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">colleges</ENAMEX> can salvage the mess left by high school, and they are only
as good as they are because of the competition and diversity among them.)
Monkeying with a curriculum to give it the correct ideological spin is fine for
the careers of school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">administrators</ENAMEX> and educational <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">consultants</ENAMEX>, but it won't
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fool students</ENAMEX>. They may not know much of the world, but they certainly
understand what the high school rewards, and it ain't learning about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jefferson</ENAMEX>
or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malcolm X. Indeed</ENAMEX>, the grand prize for doing well academically at public
high <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> is to get you as far away as possible from it, to the Ivy League
and its ilk.
            

            
               It's possible, of course, that in an alternate
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">universe</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> high <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> were truly academic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX>, the
seriously disturbed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harris</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Klebold</ENAMEX> might have open fire on the "brains,"
but I doubt it; <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of all because <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harris</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Klebold</ENAMEX> would have received
some of the acceptance they craved on their own merits, and secondly because
they would not have despised the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> so for favoring the intellectual
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">achievers</ENAMEX>. Among the most fierce hatreds of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teens</ENAMEX> (probably right after public
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">humiliation</ENAMEX> and rejection) is of hypocrisy; it's why <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Holden Caulfield</ENAMEX> is one of
the most authentic (and moral) voices in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> literature.
            

            
               My <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> set of objections to the
communitarian explanation of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Littleton</ENAMEX> is the way it over-blames <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>. All
of what you say about <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> is true, yet irrelevant. It's a given that
strong familial relationships help keep <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> on the straight path. (Note that
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harris</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Klebold</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>, from afar, seem quite ordinary, lacking the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">social</ENAMEX> pathologies typically blamed for deranged teen-age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">psyches</ENAMEX>.) But the job
of forging these relationships, never easy, is made all the harder by the
values fostered by the public schooling system. The fiercely family-oriented,
usually devoutly <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> who increasingly pull their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> out of
the system in favor of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> or religious schooling are correct to fear the
corrupting influence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbine Highs</ENAMEX>.
            

            
               Such corruption is as much intellectual as
moral. The religious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>, shifting their emphasis from athletics to
learning (even if a large part of it is of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Biblical</ENAMEX> variety), have
consistently delivered better results both in terms of educational and, I would
guess, communal development, than the public <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>. This is true most
noticeably among minority scholarship <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> from weak familial backgrounds
who have attended <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catholic</ENAMEX> parochial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> (I seem to recall <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX> having
the most famous examples of these). I am not advocating religious schooling as
a solution, but rather pointing out that educational <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX> which have
their community values focused on learning rather than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spectator</ENAMEX> sports will be
much more successful in education, and will be substantially happier places for
all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> except, of course, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">athletes</ENAMEX>, and even they will benefit from a
better education.
            

            
               I think it's an easy
(and well-traveled) path to pin the blame for many social ills on the perceived
lack of communal cohesiveness in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> life, and in some sectors it may be
correct. When it comes to suburban high <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>, though, I can say, as a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">survivor</ENAMEX> of the experience, that it's a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> almost perfectly designed to
crush, twist, and kill the spirits of those who are different, thoughtful, or
just have the bad luck to be on the wrong side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>-endorsed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elite</ENAMEX>.
So, when I come across <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intellectuals</ENAMEX> peddling more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> as a solution, it
is necessary to let off both barrels of the sawed-off rhetorical reality
check.
            

            

               Backfire
            

            I wonder if <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven Brill</ENAMEX>
has given much thought to his proposal to treat <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX> like we treat <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">automobiles</ENAMEX>.
He says in his with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Margaret Carlson</ENAMEX>: "register them and license those who
would use them." But he should put a little more thought into how we treat
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">automobiles</ENAMEX>. There is no license requirement to own an automobile. To
drive on a public <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>, one must have a tag on the car indicating that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">driver</ENAMEX> has paid a fee to put it on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>, this
fee is based on the value of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>. My piece of junk is <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $35</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> to
license.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> must also have a
license to drive a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ostensibly</ENAMEX>, this is a safety measure to ensure that
only competent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drivers</ENAMEX> are on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>. In reality, any idiot can get <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>, and
with minimal luck, avoid taking a driving test ever again. I ran a stop sign on
my test <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21 years ago</TIMEX> and still passed. Both the car tags and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">driver</ENAMEX>'s
license entitle a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> to drive in every <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Union</ENAMEX>. Under <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brill</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX>, I could pay <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$20-$40</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> to license a used revolver; take a joke of a
test administered by a surly, bored, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bureaucrat</ENAMEX>; and carry a concealed weapon
anywhere in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. I think most gun nuts could go along with that.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herbert Stein</ENAMEX>'s "" is very
interesting and to a degree valid. However, it would be very enlightening if he
would have explained the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 percent</NUMEX> gap between the female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> whose
productivity is the same or higher than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>'s in a given industry or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>.

            With regard to the law prohibiting discrimination
in this area, many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> could have told him how this is evaded. All the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">employer</ENAMEX> needs to do is give <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">male</ENAMEX> and female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> a different job
classification or title.

            A most interesting
variation on the above is at a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> of my acquaintance, where in the school
the pay for women <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> is lower because only the male <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> are allowed
to replace the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minister</ENAMEX> in some unforeseen situation.
