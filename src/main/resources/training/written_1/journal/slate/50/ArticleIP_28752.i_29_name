            Last
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX>, in a speech at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Defense University</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>
passionately disavowed the theory that ethnic slaughter is an incurable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Balkan</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>. "If <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> make decisions to do these kinds of things, other people
can make decisions to stop them," he asserted. "If the resources are properly
arrayed, it can be done." But <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five days later</TIMEX>, when asked why the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>
was refusing to send <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Apache</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">helicopters</ENAMEX> and ground <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kosovo</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinton</ENAMEX>
cited prudence, objective difficulties, and the "risk" to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX>.
"The military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> will make their decisions about when and under what
circumstances to use the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apaches</ENAMEX>," said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>. "It is not a political
decision in any way."

            These
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> statements--one ambitious and imperative, the other cautious and
detached--underscore a paradox in the war over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kosovo</ENAMEX>. In foreign policy, there
are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> rival <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> of thought--realism and idealism--and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>, as usual,
is trying to have it both ways. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> has its values, virtues, and spins.
Idealists emphasize free will; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">realists</ENAMEX> emphasize determinism. Idealists
believe in subjective resolve; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">realists</ENAMEX> believe in objective constraints.
Idealists preach responsibility and courage, which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">realists</ENAMEX> dismiss as hubris
and folly. Realists preach humility and prudence, which idealists dismiss as
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">complacency</ENAMEX> and selfishness. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Idealists</ENAMEX> tell us what we can do; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">realists</ENAMEX> tell us
what we can't do. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Idealists</ENAMEX> tend to be liberal; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">realists</ENAMEX> tend to be
conservative.

            On the
fundamental question of whether to intervene in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Balkans</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> is an
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">idealist</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX>, in what many deemed a slap at--and arguably an
oversimplification of--the theories of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Balkans</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholar</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert D. Kaplan</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holocaust</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholar</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel Jonah Goldhagen</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> repudiated those who "justify
looking away from this kind of slaughter ... by saying that these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are
simply incapable of civilized behavior." The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> asked, "Do you think the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Germans</ENAMEX> would have perpetrated the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Holocaust</ENAMEX> on their own without <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hitler</ENAMEX>? Was
there something in the history of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">race</ENAMEX> that made them do this? No.
... This is something political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> do." <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yugoslavia</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Balkan</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> argued, show that "there is another <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">path</ENAMEX> ... that discord is
not inevitable, that there is not some <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Balkan</ENAMEX> disease. ... <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Serbs</ENAMEX> simply must
free themselves of the notion that their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> must be their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enemies</ENAMEX>."

            
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Realists</ENAMEX> regard <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Serbian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX> as a fact of life, an immovable
constraint on <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> ambitions in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Balkans</ENAMEX>. "The bombing has not made much
difference" and has "strengthened the resolve of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Serbian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>," <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX>
Majority <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Whip</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom DeLay</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>, alleged <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Sunday on Meet the Press</ENAMEX> .
Likewise, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">realists</ENAMEX> view <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> lack of resolve as an objective limit
on the war's prosecution. As long as <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Yugoslav</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Slobodan Milosevic</ENAMEX> is
willing to withstand airstrikes, "there is no real end in sight," former
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary of State</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawrence Eagleburger</ENAMEX> cautioned <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this weekend</TIMEX>. Former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joint</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chiefs of Staff</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Colin Powell</ENAMEX> agreed: "It is up to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milosevic</ENAMEX> ... to
decide when he has had enough. And that makes it difficult for us." <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Shelby</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ala.</ENAMEX>, concluded, "I'm not sure we have the will to win."

            
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Idealists</ENAMEX> regard such helplessness as self-delusion. In their view, our "will
to win" is something to be mustered, not dispassionately assessed. While it may
be "difficult" to outlast <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milosevic</ENAMEX>, they posit that we can and must do so.
"It's because he's determined that we have to be determined as
well," <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jamie Shea</ENAMEX> argued on <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Late Edition</ENAMEX> . On <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Face the</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nation</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Schieffer</ENAMEX> skeptically asked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cohen</ENAMEX>, "How long are you prepared to do this?" "As long as it takes," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cohen</ENAMEX>
replied. Crystallizing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">idealists</ENAMEX>' credo, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> declared <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX>, "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">We</ENAMEX>
cannot fundamentally alter human nature, but we can alter the rules by which
all of us let our nature play out, and we can call forth our better
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">selves</ENAMEX>."

            On
this view, just as we are free to persist in the war, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Serbs</ENAMEX> are free to
back down. Here <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">idealists</ENAMEX> divide into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> camps. Moderate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">idealists</ENAMEX> claim
merely that we don't have to accept the way things are--that we can
fight on, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Serbs</ENAMEX> might not prevail. Radical idealists posit that
we can dictate the way things are--that we will fight on, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milosevic</ENAMEX>
cannot prevail. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">allies</ENAMEX> are taking, or at least mouthing,
the radical position. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milosevic</ENAMEX> faces "an unwinnable conflict," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>
asserted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX>. "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX> actions will not stop until the conditions I have
described for peace are met." <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madeleine Albright</ENAMEX> and her
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterpart</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robin Cook</ENAMEX>, took the same hard line in a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> op-ed: "We will carry on attacking <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milosevic</ENAMEX>'s military
machine until he yields. ... His <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are ignoring his call to fight in a
conflict they do not want and know they cannot win."

            All
this sounds stirring until you hear <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s less-than-idealistic excuses for
the war's shortcomings. When asked <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this weekend</TIMEX> why the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> was
withholding <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">helicopters</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joint Chiefs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> Gen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hugh Shelton</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">spokesman Shea</ENAMEX> answered with mumbo jumbo about "training," "operational
matters," "procedural matters," and the "moving parts" of a "complex
operation." <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>, like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shelton</ENAMEX>, mentioned the "risk" to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX>,
depicting this as a military "judgment" rather than a "political decision." But
from an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">idealist</ENAMEX>'s perspective, the decision to let <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kosovars</ENAMEX> die rather than
risk <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> lives is indeed political--and the purpose of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s allusions
to "judgment," "strategy," and "circumstances" is, as with all such realist
language, to obscure our indifference and cowardice.

            
Pressed about their cautious conduct of the war, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s putative idealists
invoke the classic realist alibi: impossibility. Why haven't we halted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Serbian</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">atrocities?</ENAMEX> "You cannot, through air power, stop individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">oppressing</ENAMEX>, murdering, and burning the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> of individual <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Albanians</ENAMEX>,"
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Undersecretary of State</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Pickering</ENAMEX> pleaded <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX>. Then why haven't we
sent in ground <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX>? "When you start with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">coalition</ENAMEX>, you have to hold that
coalition together," said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cohen</ENAMEX>. "There is no consensus within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">alliance</ENAMEX> for
a ground <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX>." A true <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">idealist</ENAMEX> would lobby the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">coalition</ENAMEX> hard for ground
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX>, as <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prime Minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tony Blair</ENAMEX> has done, or would jettison the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coalition</ENAMEX> and send in his own ground <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> anyway. Instead, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> team
accepts the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">coalition</ENAMEX>'s reluctance and tells us this is just the way things
are.

            And
what about the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> killed by errant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX> bombs<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">?</ENAMEX> "It is simply
not possible to avoid casualties of noncombatants in this sort of encounter,"
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> pleaded <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albright</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cook</ENAMEX> agreed. "Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> argue as if
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milosevic</ENAMEX> can be opposed militarily through a campaign of 'immaculate
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">coercion</ENAMEX>,' in which no mistakes are made and no innocent casualties occur. But
that is not the nature of conflict," they wrote in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> , borrowing
every realist buzzword in the book. "Perfection is unattainable," they
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">counseled</ENAMEX>, and "it is impossible to eliminate such casualties."

            On
other questions as well, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> use fatalism and objective language to
minimize <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> responsibility and rule out options. Have we antagonized
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>? Yes, conceded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pickering</ENAMEX>, but only "because nationalism is
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">endemic</ENAMEX> in both of those <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>." Are we backing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kosovo Liberation Army</ENAMEX>?
No, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cohen</ENAMEX>, but "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milosevic</ENAMEX> is going to find that his military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> are
systematically being diminished at a time when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KLA</ENAMEX> will come back," since
it is "getting money and support and some <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX> from other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>, no doubt."
Could we curb <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milosevic</ENAMEX>'s aggression through diplomacy rather than bombing?
Impossible, argued <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albright</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cook</ENAMEX>: "He will not stop until he is forced to
do so."

            Behind
these explanations lies a coldly realistic assessment of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX>:
If our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX> are killed, the public will turn against the war; and if the
public turns against the war, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> will have to withdraw our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX>. This
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assessment</ENAMEX> rules out idealistic scenarios: that the public might accept the
sacrifice and continue to support the war, or that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> might persist and
try to win back public confidence rather than bail out. Based on this
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assessment</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX> has kept ground <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> out of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kosovo</ENAMEX>, allowing atrocities to
continue, and has kept its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planes</ENAMEX> high above <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Serbian</ENAMEX> anti-aircraft batteries,
limiting our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX>' ability to distinguish <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">refugees</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Serb</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> on the
ground.

            None
of this proves that realism is corrupt. Realism tempers the romanticism of
idealists with a sense of tragedy. It's not our job to police the whole
world , says the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">realist</ENAMEX>. Even if it were, we couldn't afford it. Even if
we could afford it, we don't have the will to do it. Even if we had the will to
do it, we couldn't stop killings everywhere. Even if we stopped killings
everywhere, we couldn't do so without killing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> ourselves. Even if we
avoided killing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, we couldn't repair every war-torn region. Nor is
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s blend of realism and idealism necessarily corrupt. Perhaps we
should be idealistic about intervention in general but realistic in how
we go about it.

            But
the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">realist</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">idealist</ENAMEX> distinction does clarify <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> puzzles about the war. One is
why almost nobody wholly supports it. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Idealists</ENAMEX> don't like the way it's being
fought; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">realists</ENAMEX> think we shouldn't have started it in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> place. The
other puzzle is the incoherence of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX>, punctuated by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DeLay</ENAMEX>'s
bizarre complaint that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) "hollowed out our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> while he's
running around having these adventures all over the world"; and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) fallen short
of "victory" in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kosovo</ENAMEX> by using "excessive rhetoric supported by underwhelming
force" in a conflict involving "no strategic interest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>."
You can fault <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s piety and recklessness from a realistic standpoint. You
can fault his cowardice and cynicism from an idealistic standpoint. But the
only way to combine piety, cowardice, cynicism, and recklessness is to hit him
from both sides.
