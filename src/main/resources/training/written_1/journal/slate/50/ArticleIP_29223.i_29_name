                  Dear
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudence</ENAMEX>,
               
            

            
               My <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> with a girl
whose single-parent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> is rarely at home. While I understand that she has
to work, I cannot understand why she chooses to spend most of her free time
with her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boyfriend</ENAMEX>, who lives <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an hour</TIMEX> away. The result is that her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> is
at my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">most days</TIMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> (well into <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the evening</TIMEX>) as well as most
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">weekends</ENAMEX>. Her mother calls to check on her, but this is no substitute for the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> and attention her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> needs.
            

            
               Both my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> and
I feel very sorry for her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> and understand her unwillingness to be alone
so much, but I am concerned by her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>'s neglect and resent the free
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">childcare</ENAMEX>. I have considered sending the mother a note but am convinced it
would only result in hurting the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> and making her feel unwelcome in my
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">house.</ENAMEX> I do not want to be ungenerous to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> in need. How should I handle
this?
            

            

               --<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Concerned Mother</ENAMEX>
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dear Con</ENAMEX>,

            Sending a note to this
neglectful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>, you correctly imagine, will not change the situation for the
better. The not-so-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hot mother</ENAMEX> will become defensive, and one way or another the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">kid</ENAMEX> will pay the price. It sounds to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudie</ENAMEX> as though you and your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX>
like this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>, so why don't you redo your thinking, privately, and come to
see this de facto <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of your household as a kind of foster <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>. Think of
your open-door policy as an act of charity, a chance to make an important
contribution to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">youngster</ENAMEX>'s life. Your kind approach will also serve as a
model for your own <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX>. If you think it useful, discuss your new approach
with your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX>. It can only help her if she knows her own <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mom</ENAMEX> is
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consciously</ENAMEX> trying to make a difference. It can only be a wonderful lesson, by
example, for her to see generosity put into practice.

                  Dear
Prudie,
               
            

            
               Recently my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> wrote to you concerning my .
Your answer was predictable: It's unsafe; tell him to do this in private. Well,
my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> nearly fainted to see me castigated in public, no less on the
Internet!
            

            
               However, I feel constrained to respond. I never
do this in an unsafe driving situation--i.e., curves, crowded <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX>, etc. I've
done this all over the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New England</ENAMEX> mostly on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">turnpike</ENAMEX>,
with never a mishap. My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> cannot say the same ... and she doesn't floss
while driving. I guess what I'm trying to say is, if a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> can maintain
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> of the situation, he shouldn't be found guilty of not operating
according to the manual.
            

            
               Thanks for letting
me vent.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dear Floss</ENAMEX>,

            One might surmise that
your driving record while flossing is better than the beloved's with both her
hands free. Perhaps this is a tug of war where the rope is, symbolically,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dental floss</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudie</ENAMEX> hopes you two can settle this matter amicably so that the
next step is not clenched teeth.

                  Dear
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudence</ENAMEX>,
               
            

            
               <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Some weeks ago</TIMEX> I made the acquaintance of a new
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co-worker</ENAMEX> (of the opposite sex). We hit it off well, and I asked him to lunch.
After some scheduling problems we managed the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meal</ENAMEX> and had, I thought, a
charming time. After that he was quite pleasant when we ran into each other.
Recently I asked him to join me again for lunch. He pleaded the press of work
and asked for a raincheck. After letting a week tactfully pass, I asked again.
He again declined, mentioning the proverbial raincheck. His manner has
definitely changed, and I know he's going to some lengths to avoid me.
            

            
               Needless to say I am disappointed, but I'm
certainly not planing to press my attentions on him. Unfortunately the
atmosphere now feels strained. Should I speak to him or just let matters rest?
I'm puzzled.
            

            
               Thanks for your
assistance.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dear Lunch</ENAMEX>,

            To pass on a wise nugget
from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudie</ENAMEX>'s favorite, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dorothy Parker</ENAMEX>: It's not the tragedies of life that
defeat you, it's the messes. What has happened is that the object of your
attention began to feel crowded ... for whatever reason. It could be that he
found you more aggressive than was comfortable, since the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> and
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> invitations were yours. It could be that while he behaved politely, the
initial lunch was not as charming as you thought. It could be that he intuited
more of an interest on your part than he was prepared to deal with. He could
very well be neurotic, or you may not be aware of your own firepower. Whatever
the actuality, he is definitely ducking you, and your next move should be this:
Behave in a cordial, correct, and distant manner. When you encounter him,
simply nod, smile, and keep going. This approach is the best thing for both of
you.

                  Dear
Prudie,
               
            

            
               I just received a
wedding invitation via e-mail at work. It's from a person I don't really know
that well. I will not attend. Am I obligated to send a gift?
            

            

               --eg244
            

            Dear eg,

            A wedding invitation via
e-mail? At work? And you don't know the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> well? My, my, how outr√© .
Do not even think of responding with a gift. What might be in order, however,
is a certificate of chutzpah .

            
--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudie</ENAMEX>, properly

            
               
                  Dear
Prudie,
               
            

            
               I have just written
a letter to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> I have been out of touch with for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several years</TIMEX>. He and I
were the closest of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buddies</ENAMEX>. Then my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> moved away from our small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">hometown</ENAMEX>
and married. We both settled down ... considerably. I have written to him a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> of times over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last few years</TIMEX> and have received no response. I would
really like to reawaken the friendship. Any suggestions?
            

            

               --<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anonymous</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wyoming</ENAMEX>
            

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dear Anon</ENAMEX>,

            The ways of the world
are largely a matter of guesswork. Your letter has every indication that your
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pal</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the old days</TIMEX> is uninterested in picking up the thread. One might
postulate a number of reasons. Your youthful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">best pal</ENAMEX> may not remember things
the way you do, he may be disinclined to pick up a long-distance friendship,
or, sadly, his life may have gone haywire and he just isn't up to rejuvenating
the old bond. Do leave things alone, and accept that you may never know the
underlying reasons.

            --<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudie</ENAMEX>, regretfully
