   
   
      
         
            I Dream of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Julia</ENAMEX>

            Imagine that you're a modestly ordinary fellow
invited to a humble dinner <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX>, that you ask if you can bring a date, and
that you show up with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Julia Roberts</ENAMEX>: "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hi</ENAMEX>, this is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Julia</ENAMEX>. Where do we put our
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">coats</ENAMEX>?" Jaws drop; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> fall all over themselves; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buddies</ENAMEX>, goggle-eyed, take
you aside: "How did you manage that ?" What a shallow, empty, and
pathetic reverie: having one's worth enhanced by a gorgeous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">celebrity</ENAMEX>. And how
irresistible.

            The scene described above is the heart of
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Notting Hill</ENAMEX> , except that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Julia Roberts</ENAMEX> is called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anna Scott</ENAMEX>--great
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">actress</ENAMEX>, magazine cover <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX>, object of worldwide idolatry and scrutiny. The
modestly ordinary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fellow</ENAMEX>, meanwhile--the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owner</ENAMEX> of a struggling travel-book shop
in the eponymous <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> neighborhood--is impersonated by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hugh Grant</ENAMEX>, who has
made a specialty of teasing ordinary modesty into extraordinary adorableness.
The film, directed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger Michell</ENAMEX> from a script by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Curtis</ENAMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Four</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weddings</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Funeral</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX>) is a brainy weave of satire and fantasy; it
would take a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neurosurgeon</ENAMEX> to unwind its trenchant observations of our
celebrity-infatuated culture from its masturbatory, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">People</ENAMEX>
magazine-worthy pipe dreams. In this, I suppose, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Notting Hill</ENAMEX> is
remarkably in tune with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zeitgeist</ENAMEX> .

            The movie isn't simply a
fantasy of a commoner winning a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">princess</ENAMEX>, however; it's also a fantasy of a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">princess</ENAMEX> publicly electing to be with someone below her <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX>. Since <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hugh</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Grant</ENAMEX> doesn't fall below too many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stations</ENAMEX>, this goes down more smoothly than
it would if he were, say, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Danny DeVito</ENAMEX>. But if <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Grant</ENAMEX> speaks through jaws
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">aristocratically</ENAMEX> locked, his <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Thacker</ENAMEX> is meant to embody a scruffy,
downwardly mobile lifestyle; as a consequence of his integrity, he must share a
flat with a cretinously <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vulgar couch potato</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spike</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rhys Ifans</ENAMEX>) and face
a stream of dim <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> who refuse to accept that his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bookshop</ENAMEX> carries
neither <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dickens</ENAMEX> nor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Grisham</ENAMEX>.

            The script gives Grant a series of deadpan <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-upmanships;
what saves him from seeming like an utter snob is his habit of drawing
attention to his own foolishness with a lovably self-deprecating stammer. When
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anna Scott</ENAMEX>--with her sunglasses and strong "don't touch" vibe--appears from
amid his shelves to ask about a particular guide to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Turkey</ENAMEX>, his recitation
dribbles off hopelessly: "There's also a very amusing incident with a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kebab</ENAMEX>--among ... many ... amusing ... incidents." His look of panic may be
translated as: "Oh, God, don't I sound like a prat. <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Kiss me</ENAMEX>." How can she
resist those floppy locks, that sheepish grin?

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Notting Hill</ENAMEX>
spins such comic awkwardness into scenes of amazing charm. Summoned to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">star</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">suite</ENAMEX> for an impromptu date, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thacker</ENAMEX> finds himself in the middle of a
press junket for her latest film and ends up posing as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalist</ENAMEX> from
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Horse</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hound</ENAMEX> --a bit that at once lampoons the idiocy of celebrity
interviews and forces the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> into a witty (and sexy) collusion. You also get
a taste of the world from which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anna</ENAMEX> is fleeing when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alec Baldwin</ENAMEX> (unbilled,
never funnier) shows up as her equally famous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boyfriend</ENAMEX>, radiating narcissistic
entitlement as he paws his celebrated squeeze and bids <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thacker</ENAMEX>--forced this
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> into impersonating a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> service waiter--to "adios those dirty dishes."
Scenes in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hero</ENAMEX>'s middle-class milieu skirt the sentimental: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">One friend</ENAMEX>
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gina McKee</ENAMEX>) is confined to a wheelchair to remind us that life is full of
unhappy, as well as happy, accidents. But the movie recovers its high spirits
whenever <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Emma Chambers</ENAMEX> appears as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thacker</ENAMEX>'s raucous, toothsome <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX>, who
blurts out when she meets <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anna</ENAMEX> that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> could be best <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">screenwriter</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Curtis</ENAMEX>, began his career with the
hilariously acrid <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BBC</ENAMEX> sitcom <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Black Adder</ENAMEX> before writing <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Tall</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guy</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Four Weddings</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Funeral</ENAMEX> --a movie that irked me,
possibly because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grant</ENAMEX> passed up the alluringly neurotic <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kristin Scott Thomas</ENAMEX>
for the vapidly bovine <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andie MacDowell</ENAMEX>, possibly because its dizzy romantic
badinage was interrupted for easy pathos involving a fatal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart attack</ENAMEX> and
other real-world calamities. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Curtis</ENAMEX> is ingenious in his slapstick farce and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">spoof</ENAMEX> mode, less assured when the emotional ante is upped. In Notting
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hill</ENAMEX> , he hasn't really thought through the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anna Scott</ENAMEX>. He must
know how lucky he is that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Julia Roberts</ENAMEX> arrived with so much astounding
baggage.

            A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> of mine once worked for a big movie <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">star</ENAMEX>.
When I asked if that star was "a nice <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX>," he looked at me the way <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hawking</ENAMEX> might if you asked whether a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">black hole</ENAMEX> was a "nice place." "Uh ... I
suppose he's nice," said my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX>. "He's nice for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">star</ENAMEX>. But when you're a
star and you go to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, for instance, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">waiters</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> fall all
over you and send you <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drinks</ENAMEX> and food, and eventually you take that kind of
attention for granted--and pretty soon you expect everything to revolve around
you, and then you get upset when it doesn't.

            "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stars</ENAMEX>," he concluded,
"sometimes bestow their favors graciously, but they're never 'nice.' Being a
star precludes niceness."

            The best thing to be said about the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anna Scott</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roberts</ENAMEX>--an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actress</ENAMEX> certainly capable of playing nice--is that she isn't nice
for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a second</TIMEX>. In fact, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roberts</ENAMEX> seems to welcome the opportunity to be as flat
and guarded--as shut down--as possible while still giving an ingratiating
performance. According to a profile in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vanity Fair</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roberts</ENAMEX> protested
the script's depiction of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anna</ENAMEX>'s distraught reaction to the release of a nude
video: She argued that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anna</ENAMEX> would have learned not to let tabloid scandals get
to her, because that way lies madness. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> reminded her--as one might
a small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>--that she was playing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anna</ENAMEX>, not <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Julia</ENAMEX>, but I side with the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actress</ENAMEX> here. Whatever depth this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> has is the upshot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roberts</ENAMEX>'
attempt to communicate something about her own <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">celebrity</ENAMEX>: to say that it has
made her overdefended, and that it's a constant battle to stay human in the
face of so much attention.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roberts</ENAMEX> began her career
with a supernatural amount of charisma and sometimes wobbly technique: She was
a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">skittish thoroughbred</ENAMEX> who needed to be handled (i.e., directed) with care. As
she has become more self-sufficient, she has become more interesting. She
wasn't afraid to embrace the more heartlessly grasping side of her character in
My <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Best Friend's Wedding</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>), and her turn as a strange, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medusa</ENAMEX>-like
seductress on a recent <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Law & Order</ENAMEX> was a tour de force. (I missed
her in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stepmom</ENAMEX> --my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">raccoon</ENAMEX> had <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis</ENAMEX>.) She doesn't need
her <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pretty Woman</ENAMEX> laughing shtick to hold your attention: She trusts her
features, which are huge and nearly clownlike in their dimensions but which
somehow coalesce into a heart-stopping symmetry. (Is it my imagination, though,
or have those lips become even more pillowy? Leave them alone, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Julia</ENAMEX>.) In
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Notting Hill</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roberts</ENAMEX> takes rejection with a frozen smile. Thus
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">shielded</ENAMEX>, she has never looked so exposed. Her <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anna</ENAMEX> is such a cauldron of
unresolved impulses--rage, petulance, fear, deceptiveness, promiscuity--that
it's no wonder that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">filmmakers</ENAMEX> had to tack on a corny, too-pat coda that
spells out the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX>'s happily-ever-afterhood. There's no way we could
otherwise picture a stable future. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roberts</ENAMEX> has left the movie's cozy romantic
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fantasyland</ENAMEX> in a pile of jagged shards.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N otting Hill</ENAMEX> opens with an superfluous voice-over
that sets the scene and makes certain that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> is oriented. In
contrast, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bernardo Bertolucci's Besieged</ENAMEX> , from a script that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> wrote with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clare Peploe</ENAMEX>, has no narration and little dialogue: The
intent is to keep the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> disoriented. It works, maybe to a fault. The
film opens in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX>, where the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shandurai</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Thandie Newton</ENAMEX>) is seized
by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX> for insolence toward the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>'s authoritarian <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ruler</ENAMEX>. When we
encounter the young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> again, she has taken a job as the live-in domestic at
a huge and crumbling <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">townhouse</ENAMEX> belonging to an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> loner named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jason</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kinsky</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Thewlis</ENAMEX>). <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">All day</TIMEX>, this gangling, bug-eyed oddball plays <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scriabin</ENAMEX>
on his grand piano while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shandurai</ENAMEX> dusts, vacuums, sews, irons, and launders.
Then he sends a ring down the dumbwaiter to her <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">basement room</ENAMEX> by way of
proposing marriage.

            I frankly don't know what to make of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Besieged</ENAMEX> , which attempts to forge a complicated relationship between its
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">protagonists</ENAMEX> through "pure cinema," and has won admiration for being allusive,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">elusive</ENAMEX>, elliptical, and other words that begin with "a" and "e" (enigmatic,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ambivalent</ENAMEX>, evocative, etc.). In one sequence, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kinsky</ENAMEX> struggles to compose a
piece while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shandurai</ENAMEX> vacuums. The camera swings from side to side with
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shandurai</ENAMEX> and her vacuum cleaner, then from side to side with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kinsky</ENAMEX> and his
chords as he becomes increasingly inspired. Is this satire, or does Bertolucci
really mean to suggest a higher communion? (I fear the latter.) And are
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kinsky</ENAMEX>'s rippling, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philip Glass</ENAMEX>-like progressions meant to suggest profundity
or empty pretentiousness? (I fear the former.) The movie has virtuoso passages:
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bertolucci</ENAMEX> is one of the few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">filmmakers</ENAMEX> whose technique is simultaneously
sweeping and probing. His camera sweeps and then stops to probe--it fixes on an
object and holds it up for scrutiny--and then goes back to sweeping. But what
he means by what he shows is anybody's guess. It's possible that
Besieged is meant to be vaguely allegorical: The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> is seduced by
the crumbling decadence of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> while the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> falls for the childlike
simplicity of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX>. But I sure hope not.
