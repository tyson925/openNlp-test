            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">About 30 years ago</TIMEX> I attended an exhibition of
corsets at a great costume collection in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manchester</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX>. In a dim room
were gathered a dozen elegant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">undergarments</ENAMEX>, each in its own glass case, and
each accompanied by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least three</NUMEX> paragraphs of scholarly labeling about
materials, structure, and shape.

            Chosen from a collection of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">hundreds of corsets</NUMEX>,
these garments dated only from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the second quarter of the 18</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">th</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">century</ENAMEX>. They were masterpieces of delicate craftsmanship; no <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> were exactly
the same. Looking at them was like looking at ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Etruscan</ENAMEX> bronzes or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> enameled boxes. But it was also like a private showing: Nobody else
was there. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">those days</TIMEX>, "costume" was dear only to a few obsessed
antiquarians, with no connection to the mad scuffle of fashion in real life. A
show back then at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metropolitan Museum of Art</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Costume Institute</ENAMEX> might have
displayed a tired ecclesiastical vestment from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">17 th</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> or
a stiffly embroidered <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">linen</ENAMEX> nightcap looking inert and inscrutable.

            No longer. The current <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Costume Institute</ENAMEX> show, "Our
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Clothes</ENAMEX>: Acquisitions of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1990s</TIMEX>," vibrates with modern energy. Under
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">curator Richard Martin</ENAMEX>'s direction, fashions of the moment resonate backward
into the past, and the modes of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">olden days</TIMEX> awaken to new life next to their
modern revisions. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin</ENAMEX> also succeeded in intermingling history and the
present day in an earlier show called "The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ceaseless Century</ENAMEX>," by which he
meant the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">18 th</NUMEX> .

            There were reasons for
picking that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">century</TIMEX>. Chic outfits in good condition date back <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only as far as</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about 1700</TIMEX>, or maybe a little before that. Except for bits and pieces, no
gorgeous suits from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare</ENAMEX>'s day survive, no gold-bordered gowns from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mona</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lisa</ENAMEX>'s wardrobe, none of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard III</ENAMEX>'s rich doublets fitted to his
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">humpback</ENAMEX>. The dazzling styles of the distant past live only in pictures.

            A fashion <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">designer</ENAMEX> can put old imagery to use. But a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">collector</ENAMEX> needs history in material form, the better to display its links with
the productions of more recent ateliers. The earliest and most magnificent item
in the current show is a bright <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salmon</ENAMEX>-pink <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX>'s ensemble from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1708</TIMEX>,
made of silk damask brocaded in bold patterns with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">multicolored silk floss</ENAMEX> and
metallic thread. The strong color and buoyant presence of this ornate dress
command our attention; the dress has no mustiness at all. Another, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>,
ensemble from around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1760</TIMEX>, all in canary-yellow silk taffeta, self-trimmed in
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">miles</ENAMEX> of applied pleated ruffles, creates a similar effect. These dramatic
dresses easily compete in intensity or sensationalism with the vivid works by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Issey Miyake</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Alix Gr√©s</ENAMEX> nearby.

            Some
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18 th -century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>'s outfits are equally bold, especially a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">French</ENAMEX>
coat dated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1787-92</TIMEX>--which is to say, just at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Revolutionary</ENAMEX> moment.
This lean, unadorned, high-collared garment in plain fire-engine-red wool
contrasts wonderfully with a peach velvet and green satin coat-and-waistcoat
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>'s ensemble from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about 1765</TIMEX>, its cuffs and vest covered with embroideries,
its buttons glittering with paste <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diamonds</ENAMEX>. The latter was made at a time when
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> was still on, and refined <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">elegance</ENAMEX> could still relax and keep
refining. A bright blue checked <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">linen tailcoat</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> dated around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1815</TIMEX>,
neat and tight fitting with self-covered buttons, is a nice contrast to both of
these. Its summery simplicity suggests fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artlessness</ENAMEX> and love of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">convenience</ENAMEX>.

            The antique menswear in this show has a clarity of line and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">color</ENAMEX> that claims an affinity with the surges of invention in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>'s clothes
right now. There's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Ford</ENAMEX>'s red velvet suit from his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996-97 winter</TIMEX>
collection, displayed next to the red wool <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">French Revolutionary</ENAMEX> coat: Its
old-fashioned 1970s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">redness</ENAMEX> sets up vibrations with older-fashioned 1790s
redness, and both look timely. A brotherhood of male expression communicates
across time, and we start to imagine the red coats of the future. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jean-Paul</ENAMEX>
Gaultier, of course, has already begun (after all, this is the only designer
who has repeatedly offered skirts for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gaultier</ENAMEX>'s dark red and white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>'s
jacket in silk-and-rayon twill has a modern classical shape, but it's printed
with variably modulated stripes that form the vision of a nude <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> classical
torso, complete with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX> and thighs. At the groin, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sides</ENAMEX> of the jacket
discreetly curve apart to unveil the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wearer</ENAMEX>'s own black-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">trouser</NUMEX>-clad
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">crotch</ENAMEX>.

            Numerous white dresses are gathered in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. The
earliest is another <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">th -century damask ensemble</ENAMEX>. It's in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ivory</ENAMEX> and dates from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1770</TIMEX>, and its flavor and trimmings are consciously echoed
by an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> wedding dress from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about 1880</TIMEX>. The intervening snowy marvels are
in <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">cotton</ENAMEX>--crisp and vigorous, or frothy and delicate--followed by the modern
silky columns that cling, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fall</TIMEX>, or drape in unexpected ways. The possibilities
of feminine white turn out to be infinite, to mirror any emotional and erotic
nuance in the souls of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three centuries</TIMEX>.

            The exhibit made me hope that the fashion of the
future will be all the more liberated for seeking its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> in the liberties
of the past. But the show made me realize something else as well: that our
present clothes are already <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> pieces. The largest change in fashion since
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1968</TIMEX> has been an immense new consciousness of what clothes mean, so that people
have got used to thinking about what their own <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outfits</ENAMEX> "say." By bringing
together old and new, this exhibition encourages that habit of looking for
significance in our own garments. While we stare with detached sociological
attention at the garb of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX> who lived in complex past times, we're
invited to stare the same way at contemporary modes, to see them as the
historical artifacts of our own fraught epoch. And the gulf between Those Days
and These, once unbridgeable, starts to disappear.
