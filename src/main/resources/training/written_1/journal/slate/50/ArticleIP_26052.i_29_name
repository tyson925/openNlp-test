The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colorado</ENAMEX>

negotiations and new elections in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> (scheduled for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 17</TIMEX>) have delayed
the process. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> editorial spin: The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Palestinians</ENAMEX> held off because the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Union</ENAMEX> asked them to do so and promised to

New evidence
supports the theory that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mars</ENAMEX> once resembled <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX> . A magnetic pattern
on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mars</ENAMEX> indicates that it had dynamic, internal heat similar to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX>'s,
increasing the likelihood that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mars</ENAMEX> had a warm atmosphere, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, and

The

<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> have been finding <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">frogs</ENAMEX> around the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> with deformed,
missing, or extra limbs. The old theory: The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">frogs</ENAMEX> are a harbinger of a
"poisoned environment," possibly caused by industrial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemicals</ENAMEX> or erosion of
the ozone layer. The new theory, based on subsequent studies: The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">frogs</ENAMEX>'
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX> was screwed up by parasites that infected them. The new version of
the old theory: The parasites are a harbinger of a poisoned environment.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX>

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Florida</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawmakers</ENAMEX> have agreed to give <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> in bad public school districts
state-funded vouchers to attend private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> . It is the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>'s
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> state voucher program. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> already have vouchers, and some states
are considering similar proposals. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> will rate districts by standardized
test scores and will let <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> in the lowest-scoring districts switch to any
school that will accept them. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> will transfer <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$4,000</NUMEX> from the school
