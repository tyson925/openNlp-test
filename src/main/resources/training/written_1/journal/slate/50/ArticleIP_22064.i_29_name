            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">D.W. Griffith</ENAMEX> raised
"crosscutting" to an art in his racist <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1915</TIMEX> epic <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Birth of a Nation</ENAMEX> ,
in which he jumped back and forth between "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">renegade Negroes</ENAMEX>" preparing to
ravish a white maiden and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ku Klux Klanners</ENAMEX> galloping chivalrously to her aid.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">True Crime</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clint Eastwood</ENAMEX> demonstrates at once how far the
medium has come in terms of race and how far it has backslid artistically--to
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about 1910</TIMEX>. As a white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalist</ENAMEX> (played by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eastwood</ENAMEX>) hastens to save an
innocent black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Isaiah Washington</ENAMEX>) from execution for the murder of a
pregnant white convenience-store cashier, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eastwood</ENAMEX> cuts from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX>'s car
careening around hairpin curves to poison-bearing tubes being inserted into the
black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>'s veins: screeching <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>, needle in vein, screeching <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>, poison
descending the tube, screeching <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>, clock going tick-tick-tick, glazed
expression on the dying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>'s face, screeech ... Not even <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Robert Altman</ENAMEX>,
who parodied this sort of climax in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Player</ENAMEX> , was cynical enough to
let his sellout filmmaker play the intravenous card.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Melodramas</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">True</ENAMEX>
Crime are all pretty much hustles, but the good ones are stylish enough to
make you love the old song and dance. This one tends toward unlovably brazen
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pokes</ENAMEX> and shoves, yet there are moments (mostly in the script) when a higher
sensibility can be glimpsed through all the galumphing crumminess. The film's
most emblematic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">beggar</ENAMEX> who trails <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oakland Tribune</ENAMEX> yelling, "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gimme</ENAMEX> pussy on toast!" or "<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gimme</ENAMEX> money on
toast!" True 
               Crime gives you sleaze on toast--a heap of tabloid
bathos, a dusting of high-mindedness, a dash of gallows humor. It's a bizarre
concoction, but it's riveting--and I use that term advisedly, in the sense of a
hack-'em-up serial killer riveting somebody's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> to the side of a door.

            The film presents <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eastwood</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Everett</ENAMEX>, a philandering
ex-alcoholic with (I swear that the movie exhumes this phrase) a "nose for
truth." After a young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">female reporter</ENAMEX> whom <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Everett</ENAMEX> has plied with drink crashes
her <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> on something called <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dead Man's Curve</ENAMEX>, the former <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotshot</ENAMEX> is
forced to fill in at a "human interest" interview with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Beachum</ENAMEX>
(<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>) <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a mere eight hours</TIMEX> before his scheduled <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">San Quentin</ENAMEX> demise. That's
the cue for what in movies is called a "conversion narrative," in which a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heretofore</ENAMEX> lost <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soul</ENAMEX> pursues a seemingly lost cause--and, inevitably, finds
redemption.

            The script, credited to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry Gross</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Brickman</ENAMEX>,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Schiff</ENAMEX> (from a potboiler by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrew Klavan</ENAMEX>), is often laughably
schematic, but much of what's outside its ramrod narrative is masterfully
orchestrated: the physical exam on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beachum</ENAMEX> that begins the film (he's in
perfect health to be killed), the meetings between the warden and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guards</ENAMEX> on
execution procedure, the testing of the different colored phones--<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> connected
to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>--outside the lethal injection chamber. The raunchy
patter between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eastwood</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Woods</ENAMEX> as his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> in chief might have made
for classic scenes if the former had known how to rein in the latter: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Woods</ENAMEX> has
ballooned into such a self-congratulatory grotesque that he now upstages his
own blowhard <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> funny, affecting sequences exploit every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>'s
pained awareness of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX>'s unmet needs. In one, the besieged <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Everett</ENAMEX> is
obliged to take his little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">zoo</ENAMEX>, so he stuffs her into a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cart</ENAMEX> and
races past the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">"Speed Zoo</ENAMEX>!") while hollering out their names--at once
thrilling the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> and endangering her life. In the other, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beachum</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX>,
visiting for the last time, loses a green crayon she needs to draw <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">grass</ENAMEX>, and
her mounting hysteria conveys her grief at the loss of her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daddy</ENAMEX> more
eloquently than any direct expression ever could. The scene's punch line--the
prison <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guards</ENAMEX> comb the parking lot for the crayon--might be the best, most
irrationally moving moment in the movie. Unless that moment is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Everett</ENAMEX>'s retort
to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beachum</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lisa Gay Hamilton</ENAMEX>) who cries out angrily, as if confronting
a wayward <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">savior</ENAMEX>, "Where were you all this time?" Shrugs the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalist</ENAMEX>, by way
of expiation, "It wasn't my story."

            That the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actor</ENAMEX> has
condemned so many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">killers</ENAMEX> to death with his <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.44</NUMEX>-caliber <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Magnum</ENAMEX> gives the
liberal thrust of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">True Crime</ENAMEX> a certain piquancy: Only <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eastwood</ENAMEX> can go to
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Quentin</ENAMEX>. But is he plausibly cast as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalist</ENAMEX>? As the taciturn
protagonist of vigilante pictures, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eastwood</ENAMEX> could be a hoot, and his struggle
to articulate something clearly beyond his range resulted in the one true
multidimensional performance of his career: the aging <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Secret Service</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> of
In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Line of Fire</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>). But this is not a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who strikes me--either
in interviews or on the big screen--as being at home with words. His comic
acting style is based on a <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">gunfighter's paranoia</ENAMEX>, on letting others speak (and
draw) <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>; the verbal forwardness of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Everett</ENAMEX> sits uneasily on his 68-year-old
frame. In any case, it has become painful to listen to Eastwood talk. That
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">voice</ENAMEX>, which never had much timbre, has grown so raspy that you can practically
see the flakes of his vocal cords swirling around his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> like dandruff.

            That's not an appetizing image, but I'm preparing you for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ravenous</ENAMEX> , the cannibal saga I predict will elicit the most derisive
reviews of any film <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX>. I'd like to recommend it, but it's too silly. On
the plus side, it's ravishingly well directed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Antonia Bird</ENAMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Priest</ENAMEX> ,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>), who reportedly came on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks</TIMEX> after shooting had commenced and
as such had little say about the thrust of the script. She could not alter the
coven of frontier cannibals to, say, lapsed <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catholic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priests</ENAMEX>, although I bet
that the idea crossed her mind. Even so, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first half</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ravenous</ENAMEX> is
tantalizingly scary. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">captain</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boyd</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guy Pearce</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">L.A. Confidential</ENAMEX> ,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>), is decorated for heroism in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">War</ENAMEX> and then exiled to
an isolated fort high in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sierra Nevada</ENAMEX> mountains of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>--a seemingly
godforsaken place where, at least in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX>, the only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passers-by</ENAMEX> are starving
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">wagon-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trainers</ENAMEX>. Why exile a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hero</ENAMEX>? It seems that he initially played dead in the
heat of battle, then awoke to find himself lodged under a messy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">corpse</ENAMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> from which was running into his mouth. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Invigorated à la Popeye the Sailor</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Man</ENAMEX>, he proceeded to capture the enemy regiment single-handedly. Not a man
you'd want to have hovering around your mess <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bird</ENAMEX> and her cinematographer, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anthony B.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Richmond</ENAMEX>,
create a world of blinding white peaks and deep black crevices in which demons
might lodge--a world of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> driven batty from fear and isolation, where
reaching out to other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> sometimes takes the form of ingesting them. The
metaphor would be better if left suggestive, if the strange new appetites were
somehow the product of anxieties associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> westward expansionism
and "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Manifest Destiny</ENAMEX>." But the second half of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ravenous</ENAMEX> is almost
literally a dumb vampire picture, in which the chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vampire</ENAMEX> woos a reluctant
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vampire</ENAMEX> who has pangs of conscience about cooking and eating his fellow
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">man</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">"Join us</ENAMEX>! You know you want to!" <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">etc.</ENAMEX>).

            By all means see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ravenous</ENAMEX> if your taste runs
to bloody cannibal pictures. (I found it less of a gross-out than, say,
You've Got <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mail</ENAMEX> , which would have benefited from a touch of
flesh-eating.) Although <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pearce</ENAMEX> brings little to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> but his cheekbones,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeffrey Jones</ENAMEX> makes a wonderfully mordant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fort commander</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Robert</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carlyle</ENAMEX>--who pops up out of the wilderness with burning eyes and a tale of
having been forced to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cook</ENAMEX> and eat his <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX>, and traveling
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">companions</ENAMEX>--might turn out to be a major <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actor</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carlyle</ENAMEX> looks like just the
sort of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fellow</ENAMEX> who'd think it his duty to explore things that the rest of us,
deep down, want to know about but wouldn't dream of investigating ourselves.
He's someone you could actually imagine taking aside and asking, "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Er</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert</ENAMEX>,
tell me ... does it really taste like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pork</ENAMEX>?"
