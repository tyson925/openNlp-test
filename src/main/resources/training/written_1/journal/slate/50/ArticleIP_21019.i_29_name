               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Randy</ENAMEX>'s
Wrap-Up
            

            Beyond a preschool visit to a local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">dairy</ENAMEX>, my first
assembly line was at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hershey</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chocolate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factory</ENAMEX>, and it was
perfect--incredibly loud and with a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocoa</ENAMEX> aroma as thick as a fist. There were
ordinary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">items</ENAMEX>--<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">candy bars</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kisses</ENAMEX>--in infinite multiples, and ordinary
objects in gigantic versions--mixing bowls, ladles, boxes. But you'll never see
it.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hershey</ENAMEX> no longer runs a factory tour. Instead it
has a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">visitors center</ENAMEX>--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Candytown</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Chocolate Work Shoppe or Fattyland</ENAMEX>,
something like that--pathetic, fake, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Disneyfied</ENAMEX>. It's the same at most
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factories</ENAMEX>. Fear of lawsuits has superseded pride in the product.

            One delightful exception, should you like your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>
to see something made, and an easy drive from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hershey</ENAMEX>, is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mack Truck</ENAMEX> in
Macungie, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pa.</ENAMEX> While it's an assembly <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>, not a manufacturing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>, they do
start with a pile of parts in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX> and roll <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> of those big <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> out the
door by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the day</TIMEX>. You get to see <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> building something that's not
idiotic, a great treat for one who's worked in television.

            It's interesting that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dem-Rep</ENAMEX> safari is at the site of a pseudoexperience rather than the real thing.
But if you're trying to inspire artificial amity, that's not such a bad
choice.

            
               <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Randy</ENAMEX>'s
Recantation
            

            Several of you chided me
for calling the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">travelers</ENAMEX> "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">congressmen</ENAMEX>," omitting the women <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX>.
Quite right. My mistake.

Answer
            

            They're going to pretend that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam Waterston</ENAMEX> is
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lincoln</ENAMEX>.

            As they did in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> are
attending a retreat. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Leaders</ENAMEX> of both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> are expected, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dennis</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hastert</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Gephardt</ENAMEX>. Among the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> will be <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">historian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Doris Kearns</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goodwin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Hume</ENAMEX> who, along with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Trimble</ENAMEX>, won the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Nobel Peace Prize</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> for his work in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Northern Ireland</ENAMEX>. Waterston, supported by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">troupe</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actors</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">historians</ENAMEX>, will present selections from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Great Emancipator</ENAMEX>.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pew Charitable Trust</ENAMEX>
is providing <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$700,000</NUMEX> to underwrite the event.

            
               Month of Junk
Extra
            

            I received <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> unsolicited e-mails in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February</TIMEX>, not a
huge number, but it's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a short month</TIMEX>, and I use a local Internet service
provider. Most of this trash, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> pieces, proffered business
opportunities--dubious investments, credit card schemes, home employment.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Eleven</NUMEX> involved retail sales (dental care, computers, divorce <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX>, online
auctions); <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> announced some sort of performance; one was an ancient chain
letter scam.

            Each investment scheme began with a lie. Ask to be
removed from the list, and you learn that the return address is bogus. I
suppose I'll never get my money back. Or earn enough to buy that solid gold
hat.

            A few highlights:

            "The announcement of this scientific breakthrough

            If this is an investment
opportunity, it's unconvincing. If it's a personal suggestion, it's
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">impertinent</ENAMEX>--like I'm not doing fine with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nyquil</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Kahl√∫a</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cocktails</ENAMEX>.

            Tempting. But my money's
