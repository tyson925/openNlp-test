            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Gross</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pasadena</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Calif.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">businessman</ENAMEX>, has a great moneymaking idea. His <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Free</ENAMEX>-PC.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX>, will
ship you a free <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">333</NUMEX>-megahertz <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Compaq</ENAMEX> computer. He'll also give you free
Internet access and a free maintenance contract. In return, all he wants is two
little things. Your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soul</ENAMEX> and a pound of flesh? No, just your eyeballs and a bit
of demographic information. "Eyeballs" is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Webspeak</ENAMEX> for the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who
see a Web page--and, presumably, any ad that is on it. If a Web page is served
to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100,000</NUMEX> computers, that counts <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as 100,000</NUMEX> eyeballs, although literally it's
more like <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200,000</NUMEX>, assuming <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> eyeballs per <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>.

            Gross' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> will
place ads on a small portion of the screen as you use your free computer. And
with the information you give him about your income, tastes, and so on, he will
be able to sell you to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">advertisers</ENAMEX> whose products and pitches are aimed at your
sort of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>. The more an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">advertiser</ENAMEX> knows about you, the more it is willing
to pay to reach you. On the Internet, such information is even more useful
because it's easier to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fine-tune</ENAMEX> who sees an ad. The ad you see at the top of
this page may be different from the one your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX> sees when she visits this
same article. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Gross</ENAMEX> can send each of his free computer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> ads for
precisely what he or she is most likely to buy. In this way <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gross</ENAMEX> hopes to make
back his costs and then some.

            Of course, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gross</ENAMEX> is not the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> with this idea. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Web</ENAMEX> is full of sites that give away valuable stuff free in the hope of making
it back in advertising. 
                  Slate
               , notoriously, for starters. And
this practice is not unknown in other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX>, either. Television programming is
still mostly free to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX>. And even <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX> and traditional magazines
don't begin to cover their costs from what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> pay. Those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> are
heavily subsidized by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">advertisers</ENAMEX> hoping to sell them stuff. What's notable
about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Web</ENAMEX> is the profusion of free offerings that go way beyond mere
editorial content filling in the space between ads. There's an online store
called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Onsale</ENAMEX> atCost selling computer equipment at the true wholesale price.
Onsale atCost may be the only <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX> in the world to hire PricewaterhouseCoopers
to document that it is not going to make a profit. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SportsLine</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">com</ENAMEX>
actually pays you to get sports <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scores</ENAMEX> from their site. The site counts the
number of times you visit <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">SportsLine</ENAMEX>, and frequent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> are given T-shirts and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sunglasses</ENAMEX>. Each time you visit you are even entered in <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1 million</NUMEX> prize
sweepstakes. And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AllAdvantage</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX> promises to pay you up to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$20</NUMEX> per month for
downloading an application that displays ads in the corner of your screen.
It'll pay you even more if you can convince your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> to sign up as
well.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eFax</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX> will give you a
free fax number and allow you to receive faxes by e-mail--free. Everyone wants
to give you free e-mail. Free personal address books and calendars, free
mapping services, free personalized news and weather--all are available in
exchange for your eyeballs and a bit of information about yourself, either
asked for explicitly or gleaned from what you reveal in using the free
service.

            Which raises the question: How much can your eyeballs
possibly be worth? Suppose I could insidiously find out enough about you to
influence every purchasing decision you make. Suppose I could promise that
every ad I sold you would go straight to your spending reflex. What could I
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sell</ENAMEX> that power for?

            Let's do some math.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gross</ENAMEX> pays <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$600</NUMEX> for the computer. Add <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$100</NUMEX> a year for the
Internet connection and the service contract and assume the computer has a
usable life of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</TIMEX>. He's paying <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$400</NUMEX> per year for your attention. How on
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">earth</ENAMEX> is he going to make this back? Well, suppose some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chiat/Day</ENAMEX> ad wizard can
create a series of banner ads, which, by blinking in the corner of your screen,
compel you to go out and buy <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$400</NUMEX> worth of stuff. It's hard to imagine, but
it's not crazy. But <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$400</NUMEX> of sales isn't good enough. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hewlett-Packard</ENAMEX> isn't
going to pay <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$400</NUMEX> for your eyeballs if you're just going buy <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">one $400</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hewlett-Packard</ENAMEX> printer. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hewlett-Packard</ENAMEX> needs <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$400</NUMEX> in profit , which may
mean <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 or 20</NUMEX> printers . That is, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gross</ENAMEX> must convince his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">advertisers</ENAMEX>
that they'll get <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$400</NUMEX> of profit per <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer</ENAMEX>, which means, say,
something like <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$4,000</NUMEX> in sales . <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Each year</TIMEX>. Just from you. And just
because of his ads.

            Now consider that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">advertisers</ENAMEX> spend <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">an estimated $100</NUMEX>
billion plugging goods and services to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX>. In
other words, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">advertisers</ENAMEX>, as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, think that affecting the purchasing
decisions of an entire <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">household</ENAMEX> of average eyeballs is worth <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1,000</NUMEX> per year.
That's for all the ads you see in every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">medium</ENAMEX>, from television to billboards,
in the course of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Gross</ENAMEX> is betting that his ads alone, aimed at
just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>, will be worth <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost half</NUMEX> that amount. Maybe he will manage to
find bigger <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">spenders</ENAMEX>. Or maybe he'll be wildly more successful in affecting
their decisions. Or maybe he's nuts.

            His task will be easier
if his <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$400</NUMEX> doesn't have to come out of what <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">advertisers</ENAMEX> are already spending
but by convincing them that it's worth spending more. That's where the
demographic information comes in. This is not a new concept, of course. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">John</ENAMEX>
Wanamaker, who built a department store <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19 th -century</TIMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philadelphia</ENAMEX>, once said, "<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Half</NUMEX> the money I spend on advertising is wasted ... I
only wish I knew which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>."

            Targeting is a solution to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wanamaker</ENAMEX>'s problem. You can
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">deliver Lexus</ENAMEX> ads to affluent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> pulling down <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $100,000</NUMEX> per
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>. To less fortunate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX>, you can deliver, say, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hyundai</ENAMEX> ads. To get a
sense of how valuable targeting is to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">advertisers</ENAMEX>, the New York
Times-- which makes you give demographic information in order to register
for the site--charges <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">four cents</NUMEX> for a banner ad that's shown to everyone and
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> cents for one that is targeted. In other words, targeted ads are worth <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>
percent more. Yahoo! can tell what your interests are by the search you're
entering. In writing this article, I entered "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lexus</ENAMEX>" into Yahoo! and, sure
enough, a banner ad for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lexus</ENAMEX> popped up above my search results. And when I
entered "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX>" I got a banner ad for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> . Both
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lexus</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> pay for this service. On average, these targeted
search engine ads cost <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 percent</NUMEX> more than ordinary bulk ads.

            But is the Internet so
miraculous an advertising <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vehicle</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gross</ENAMEX> will be able to siphon off <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$400</NUMEX>
per <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> from total ad spending of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1,000</NUMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>--or persuade <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">advertisers</ENAMEX>
to spend <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">an additional $400</NUMEX> to reach each of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX>? This isn't so
obvious. After all, targeting is not unique to the Internet. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lexus</ENAMEX> ad in
Car and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Driver or Fortune</ENAMEX> is pretty well targeted at affluent
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who like fancy <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX>. And ads on the Internet, at least so far, lack
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">oomph</ENAMEX>. A banner at the top of a Web page just isn't the same as a luxurious
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-page color spread.

            Targeting may increase what <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">advertisers</ENAMEX> will spend per
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">eyeball</ENAMEX>, but it also reduces the number of eyeballs they have to pay for.
Unless <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wanamaker</ENAMEX> was willing to pay double for reaching the right <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, his total ad spending would go down and not up. The apparent going
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">premium</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 percent</NUMEX> for a targeted ad on the Internet suggests that Internet
advertising may be as likely to reduce total ad spending as to increase it.

            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last year</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">advertisers</ENAMEX> spent <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2 billion</NUMEX> on the
Internet, compared with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$35 billion</NUMEX> spent on broadcast TV and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$10 billion</NUMEX> spent
on cable. That's <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2 percent</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$100 billion</NUMEX> total spent on ads in all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX>.
The Internet ad market is growing at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two or three</NUMEX> times the rate of any other
medium. So suppose <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">advertisers</ENAMEX> direct <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one-fifth</NUMEX> of their resources onto the
Internet. That would be a tenfold increase in the Internet's share. And
suppose the total market for advertising doubled . In this highly
optimistic scenario, Internet ad spending would be <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$400</NUMEX> per household. In other
words, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Gross</ENAMEX> could break even--provided he was the only <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">advertiser</ENAMEX> on the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Web</ENAMEX>.

            Eyeballs are worth money only because they are
attached to wallets. And the size of the wallets is a strict limit on the value
of the eyeballs. So have I just argued myself out of a job by mathematically
disproving the theory on which my paycheck is based? Not at all--or at least I
don't think so. Free <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> articles are one thing, free computers are
another. Exchanging stuff for eyeballs makes sense as long as the cost of
providing the stuff is less than the value of the eyeballs to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">advertisers</ENAMEX>. What
it has cost 
                  Slate
                to provide this article by me can be the basis
for a very profitable ad-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX>. Take my word for it.
