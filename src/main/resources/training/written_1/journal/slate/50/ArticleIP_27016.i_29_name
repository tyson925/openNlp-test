            The
cover story questions <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John McCain</ENAMEX>'s beatification by the press. His
oft-recounted experiences in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vietnam</ENAMEX> and well-publicized stances for campaign
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">finance</ENAMEX> reform and against <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tobacco</ENAMEX> make him seem noble, rugged, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">enlightened</ENAMEX>. But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> have ignored his unsavory side, which includes
skirt-chasing and fervent social conservatism ("he's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a thousand</NUMEX> percent
anti-gay," says <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barney Frank</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mass.</ENAMEX>). ... A story gauges the intellectual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heft</ENAMEX> of the presidential
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platforms</ENAMEX>. Too-vague <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bradley</ENAMEX> touts "lofty ideas but no proposals,"
too-specific <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> hawks "a profusion of proposals that obscure his big goals,"
and too-vague, too-unspecific <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> hasn't shared "either goal or proposal."
... A piece says that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>'s response to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intelligence</ENAMEX> scandal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">epitomizes</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s dangerous tendency "to substitute
damage control for foreign policy." The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> has brushed off the
charges with the same deft techniques--the dodge, the denial, and the claim of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">irrelevancy</ENAMEX>--that characterized its handling of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Flytrap</ENAMEX>.

            The
cover editorial, "A <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Bungled War</ENAMEX>," asserts that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX> should scrap its initial
goals of establishing autonomy and democracy in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kosovo</ENAMEX>, and settle for a
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bosnia</ENAMEX>-style peacekeeping <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">force</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milosevic</ENAMEX> is despicable, but his removal would
further destabilize <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yugoslavia</ENAMEX>. ... A story diagnoses what ails the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Trade Organization</ENAMEX>:
too much legalism, too little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX>, and the heavy new burden of
monitoring trade issues (such as food regulation and environmental protection)
that were once domestic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concerns</ENAMEX> of individual <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>. ... The
magazine lauds a recent crop of video games that emphasize strategy
and good judgment over violent combat. Even though the games are populated by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">assassins</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commandos</ENAMEX>, they are not excessively bloodthirsty; one even
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">subtracts</NUMEX> points for gratuitous kills.

            The
cover story profiles prodigal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mogul</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike Ovitz</ENAMEX>. After trying his hand at
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Disney</ENAMEX>, philanthropy, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Broadway</ENAMEX>, and professional sports, he is returning to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pinnacle</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX> hierarchy through his new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Artists Management Group</ENAMEX>,
which purports to give <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> more control of their "product." The piece
retreads his feud with his former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Creative Artists Agency</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ovitz</ENAMEX> is
sure to make <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">tons</NUMEX> of money and infuriate his former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX>, but there is no
guarantee that this will satisfy his gargantuan appetite for power.
... A piece <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">trails</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Gore</ENAMEX> on his quest to
raise <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$55 million</NUMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">2000 convention</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> has been tending his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> of
money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> all his political life, but his focus on fund raising might
overshadow his campaign message. (Evidence that this is already happening:
articles like this one.)

profile asks if hedge fund <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Cramer</ENAMEX> is a financial
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">wizard</ENAMEX> or just an attention-happy blowhard. From a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalist</ENAMEX>: "He really knows
what he's talking about." From an investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">banker</ENAMEX>: He's "a very, very good
self-promoter" and "entertainment" only. ... The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> excerpts a new
oral biography of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monty Python</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Flying Circus</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eric</ENAMEX> Idle
expresses relief that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all</NUMEX>-male <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">troupe</ENAMEX> had "no <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> to sulk or feel left
out," while <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Cleese</ENAMEX> admits that they almost called the show Bunn Wackett
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buzzard Stubble</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boot</ENAMEX> . ... The cover story lambastes journalists
for pawing through <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Julia Robert</ENAMEX>'s personal life, but reveals her shoe size, bra
size, and romantic history anyway.

            Katha
Pollitt announces her resignation from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX>'s masthead, though she will
continue to write her column. She was chagrined at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Nation</ENAMEX> 's recent
publication of a column by conservative education <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ron Unz</ENAMEX> arguing that
liberal education reform has been an unmitigated failure. (See a previous for
details). ... The cover story asserts that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth Starr</ENAMEX>'s indictment of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Julie</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hiatt Steele</ENAMEX> is based on unbelievable assertions by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kathleen Willey</ENAMEX>, who
"choreographed" her allegations to make them more "marketable." ... A
piece profiles new for-profit <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prisons</ENAMEX> specializing in geriatric <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">felons</ENAMEX> and
worries that they will cut services to bolster profits.

            Yet
another best-of<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-century</TIMEX> list: the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> most influential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX>'s
panel makes mostly predictable choices, including sculptor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Constantin Brancusi</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Surrealist Salvador Dal√≠</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abstract Expressionist Willem de Kooning</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX>

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Claude Monet</ENAMEX>, and "probably the most influential" <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henri Matisse</ENAMEX>. The unusual
picks include <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Smithson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Judd</ENAMEX>. Surprising omissions: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mark</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rothko</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander Calder</ENAMEX>.

            The

how to protect Web-surfing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> from online perils. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek</ENAMEX> 's paranoid
cover package ("it's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lord</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Flies</ENAMEX> on a vast scale") urges early childhood intervention for difficult toddlers and
"zero tolerance for bullies." <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> 's cover instructs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> to check
the ratings listed on video game boxes, block offensive content on their
computers, and click the "history" button on their browser to see where their
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> have been. A handy foldout "quality
meter" rates games and Internet sites. (Any <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12-year-old</TIMEX> could predict the
results: educational software gets a "wholesome"; sex and hate <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> are
"gruesome.") ... <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tipper Gore</ENAMEX> beseeches <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> to attend to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youngsters</ENAMEX>' mental

emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>.") ... 
               <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> reports that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> are

supported by a network of student <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">volunteers</ENAMEX>, is winning an Internet propaganda
war. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">volunteers</ENAMEX> argue politely in chat <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX>, maintain a sophisticated Web

savvily designed to pre-empt criticism from both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conservatives</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">liberals</ENAMEX>.
The plan gives <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2 percent</NUMEX> income-tax rebate to be invested in a stock

            A
piece describes how the dog <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">genome</ENAMEX> is being combed for clues about human
genetic diseases. Because <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> are deliberately inbred, genetic diseases are
easier to isolate and track. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researcher</ENAMEX>--aided by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> sleepy
