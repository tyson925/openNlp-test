            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nostradamus</ENAMEX> apparently
works in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX>. According to the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 12</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. News & World</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Report</ENAMEX> , this is what the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joint Chiefs of Staff</ENAMEX> concluded before the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kosovo</ENAMEX> operation: "If we bomb ... we will eliminate <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milosevic</ENAMEX>'s domestic
opposition, and he will become a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hero</ENAMEX>. He will go into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kosovo</ENAMEX> and slaughter
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Kosovar Albanians</ENAMEX> and create <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">refugees</ENAMEX>. Air power or
bombing cannot stop any of those things."

            The front page of
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> confirmed the prophecy, revealing that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joint Chiefs</ENAMEX> had "expressed deep reservations" in advance of the proposed
bombing. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> reported that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> had warned the
administration that "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milosevic</ENAMEX> was likely to strike out viciously against
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kosovo</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Albanians</ENAMEX>."

            These wise <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> who saw in their crystal ball exactly what
would happen in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kosovo</ENAMEX> are truly prophets without honor. These
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prognostications</ENAMEX>--divulged anonymously by "senior military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>" and
"<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planners</ENAMEX>" and "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> who know [the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joint Chiefs</ENAMEX>'] thinking but
decline to be named"--represent a particularly demoralizing aspect of modern
war-making: leaking as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> policy.

            Covering your ass is, of
course, a time-honored military tradition, enshrined with its own acronym. But
what is remarkable about the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kosovo</ENAMEX> leaks is that they are covering something
that is not being shot at. No one--literally no one --is blaming the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
military for the shortcomings of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kosovo</ENAMEX> mission. All fault has been
deposited on the doorsteps of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Politicians</ENAMEX>, not <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generals</ENAMEX>, made the risky decisions, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX>, not
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">generals</ENAMEX>, are getting reproached for them. But no matter. As soon as it became
clear that the mission had gone awry, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brass</ENAMEX> began leaking
profligately: In the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">span</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few days</TIMEX>, anonymous quotes appeared in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los Angeles Times</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>
Times , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> , and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> newsweeklies. The gist of
the leaks: The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joint Chiefs</ENAMEX> knew this would happen, they told the
administration this would happen, so don't blame them.

            The leaks stem from a basic military <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">practice</ENAMEX>:
worst-casing. During <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Vietnam</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generals</ENAMEX> insisted to their civilian <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bosses</ENAMEX> that
we could win if we just had a little more time and firepower. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX>'s armed
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">forces</ENAMEX> won't make the same mistake. "They don't want to be put in a hopeless
position and get blamed for it. This is a product of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vietnam</ENAMEX>," says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington University</ENAMEX> military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">historian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald Spector</ENAMEX>.

            So even as the brass announces incessantly that
"<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> has the finest fighting force the world has ever known," it responds
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bleakly</ENAMEX> to any presidential proposal to actually deploy that force. A top
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Gulf War</ENAMEX> describes the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generals</ENAMEX>' standard procedure:
"They tell the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>, 'You are going to need an overwhelming amount of
stuff. It's a bad idea. There will be terrible casualties. We recommend you
don't do it.' "

            "You always make
sure you have protested before," says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American University</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Professor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amos</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Perlmutter</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kosovo</ENAMEX>, for example, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generals</ENAMEX> said that a ground invasion
would require <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> (a number they knew was impossibly high) and that
bombing wouldn't work. This worst-casing has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> results: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX>
are left wondering whether to believe the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generals</ENAMEX>, since they say this
every time; and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) the military assures itself a victory in the war that
matters in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PR</ENAMEX> war.

            If the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pols</ENAMEX> overrule the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generals</ENAMEX> and the mission goes
sour, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generals</ENAMEX> are safe, on-the-record with sensible objections that can be
leaked at an opportune moment (as with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kosovo</ENAMEX>). If the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pols overrule</ENAMEX> and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mission</ENAMEX> succeeds, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generals</ENAMEX> still harvest the credit. No one remembers their
poor-mouthing. Who recalls that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Colin Powell</ENAMEX> predicted horrible casualties
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Gulf War</ENAMEX>?

            It's worth noting that
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joint Chiefs</ENAMEX> probably did not warn against the mission as emphatically or
prophetically as the leaks claim. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>, after all, is incredibly deferential
to his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joint Chiefs</ENAMEX> because of his own history of nonservice: It's impossible
to believe that he would have overruled the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chiefs</ENAMEX> if they were as absolute as
the leaks suggest. Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> also doubt the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joint Chiefs</ENAMEX> were unified in the
view that bombing wouldn't succeed: It's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX> doctrine that bombing
will succeed in such circumstances, so <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisers</ENAMEX> almost
certainly predicted a bombing triumph. Moreover, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generals</ENAMEX>' public behavior
casts doubt on the claim that they foresaw what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milosevic</ENAMEX> would do if we
bombed. The only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> concerns the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generals</ENAMEX> voiced before bombing were that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> would be vulnerable to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yugoslavia</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missile defenses</ENAMEX>: They did not
discuss the possibility that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milosevic</ENAMEX> would respond by accelerating his
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">slaughter</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kosovars</ENAMEX>.

            There is nothing wrong with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joint Chiefs</ENAMEX> warning the
administration privately that bombing was folly. In fact, it would be derelict
for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generals</ENAMEX> not to warn the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> of that. But
after-the-fact anonymous leaks are corrupting. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">military</ENAMEX> is
(theoretically) a nonpolitical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX>, but as soon as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX> went
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">south</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">military</ENAMEX> abandoned its nonpolitical fa√ßade to protect itself. From
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-stars to privates, the armed forces loathe and distrust <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>, and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">generals</ENAMEX> certainly weren't going to risk being associated with his <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kosovo</ENAMEX> mess.
So they leaked to guarantee that they would not be blamed for a quagmire or be
punished at budget time--and to ensure that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> would suffer. The backdoor
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sniping</ENAMEX> has become so pernicious and prevalent that even retired <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George</ENAMEX>
Joulwan, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX>'s military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commander</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early '90s</TIMEX>, pleaded on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNN</ENAMEX>'s
Crossfire for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> to stop leaking and "pull the team
together."

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principal</ENAMEX> reason the leaks are troubling is not
that they sabotage the relationship between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX>; that relationship is always shaky. They are troubling because they
may sabotage the mission itself. The leaks suggest to our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">allies</ENAMEX> that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">military</ENAMEX> isn't seriously engaged in the operation. And the leaks suggest
to our own <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> that their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commanders</ENAMEX> secretly believe their mission is
dangerous, useless, and possibly doomed. No inside-the-beltway <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PR</ENAMEX> victory is
worth that kind of demoralization.
