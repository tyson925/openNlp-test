               The "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group of Eight</ENAMEX>" (the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX>) approved "general principles on

               the political solution to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kosovo</ENAMEX> crisis
               ." They
include <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) "withdrawal from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kosovo</ENAMEX> of military, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> and paramilitary
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">forces</ENAMEX>," <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) "deployment in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kosovo</ENAMEX> of effective international civil and security
presences," and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) "substantial self-government for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kosovo</ENAMEX>." The upbeat spin:
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> has agreed with our conditions. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yugoslavia</ENAMEX> is isolated and will have to
cry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">uncle</ENAMEX>. Peace is at hand. The skeptical spins: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> hasn't agreed with
us on the meaning of "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX>," "effective," "international," "security,"
"presences," "substantial," or "self-government." <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) The price of winning
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX>'s endorsement was that we had to put the interpretation of these terms
under <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.N.</ENAMEX> rather than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX> jurisdiction (thereby giving <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> veto
power) and that we had to remove "all" from the description of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Serb</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> that
must withdraw.

the ground for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">four hours</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Associated Press</ENAMEX> line on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> was that
Oklahomans were comparing the devastation and trauma to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oklahoma City</ENAMEX>
bombing. "There was a sense that the storm was occurring right in front of a
nationwide <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX>, and it undermined once again the persistent na√Øve feeling
... that what we can watch so closely we can somehow control," proclaimed the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> . "We have perpetuated the myth of a kind of visual
coexistence with twisters. But to watch your own tornado is a little like
watching your own funeral."

how much lurid detail the trial will provide.
